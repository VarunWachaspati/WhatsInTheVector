A GARDEN, LOW GARDEN WALL, ANDA HOUSE.Enter a COURIER.COURIER.Hoa, there ! You in the garden there !HANS without.Ann ! (Enters).Good day, Sir. A fine morning. Did you call ?Esther! Esther!COURIER.Who lives here ?HANS.My master.COURIER.That know I well as you do ! Do you think1 took you for the owner of the house ?HANS.I never said you did. O Esther !B.Who .here?THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. [ACTCOURIER.HANS.My master, as I said before.COURIER.You sluggish-witted knave ! I want to knowYour master's name.HANS.Couldn't you tell me soAt once ? What need of going round about,The gate before your nose ? Why give you talk,And call you names, when all the fault's your own ?How could I guess it was my master's nameYou wished to know O Esther !COURIER.Who lives here ?HANS.The minister of Mariendorpt.COURIER.Is thatThy master's name ?HANS.Why, 'tis all one. His nameIs Muhldenau, and he's the ministerOf Mariendorpt.COURIER.Is that the only doorTo the house ?HANS.Go round, you'll find another door,The proper one O Esther !SCENE i.] THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. 3COURIER.This way ?HANS.Yes.COURIER.Fd like to have the quick'ning of thy wits !Est ER Without.What does that coxcomb speaking there so high ?HANS.There's Esther coming ! You had best be off !Courier.Hang you and her together ! [Goes out.HANS.That is kind.I would not mind to hang along with her !I'm sick for love ! Fin sure I am ! I have lostMy appetite ! My stomach was my clockThat used to give me note of eating-timeIt never warns me now ! A smoking dishWas sure to set my heart a-beating once ;Now be it flesh, or fish, or fowl, or aught,It moves me nothing. I would rather feastA thousand times I would on Esther's face !I'm mortal sick for love ! I used to sleep ;Scarce touched my head my pillow, I was off,And, let me lie, I took my measure on'tSix hours, at least, upon a stretch ! but nowI toss and turn, lie straight, or doubled up,Enfold mine arms, or throw them wide abroad,Rhyme o'er my prayers, or count a hundred out,And then begin again yet riot a winkThe richer foret, but rise as I lie down !And 'tis true love that ails me! very love !B24 THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. [ACT i.Of womankind but one can work my cure !'Tis not as one may fancy veal, and yetPut up with mutton ! If I get not her,I starve and die ! How I do love thee, Esther !But thou regards it not, nor mayest it heed ;Thou rates me as nothing ; but Pm something,Or never had I falPn in love with thee.Nor durst I tell thee how I love thee, Esther !O ! my fair Esther ! O ! my goddess, Esther !My lily, pink, rose, tulip, everythingThat's beautiful and sweet ! would thou wast byTo hear the love names Pm calling thee !ESTHER enters, speaking angrily, holding some roots.ESTHER.Hoa, sirrah Hans ! Is this your work ?HANS.Dear Esther!Esther, I can bear anything exceptYour anger ! labour without wages ! workFrom morn till night go without breakfast, dinner,Or supper suffer aught, yet be a man !But when you rate me I am good for nothing!A joint that's pick'd to the bone fish, three days staleWine gone a month without the stopper cheeseScoop' d to the rind and kept in a hot pantry,Or foot of capon only with the stringsRaked from the garbage where 't has lain a week !Don't scold me then in sooth you should not don't,For never say I unkind word to thee,But call thee still all sorts of loving names.ESTHER.You've spoilt my garden! hoed my tulips upInstead of weeds you haveSCENE i.] THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT.HANS.Don't stamp at me,It makes my heart jump Ah ! 'Twas kind of youTo stop ! But knew she how I loved her foot,She would not stamp it at me.ESTHER.Why do you touchMy garden ?HANS.'Tis to make it orderly ;Keep the earth smooth, and rake it small as crumbs ;Prop the tall flowers with standards ; clear the bedsOf chick-weed, grass, and thievish dandelion,That sucks up all the nourishment around it ;Trim the box edges straight and of a piece.And roll the gravel walks till they are evenAnd smooth as any carpet.ESTHER.Would your painsWould spare themselves ! The other day you brokeMy finest rose.HANS.It was with kissing it !It was indeed your finest rose, and soI call'd it Esther, and in very truthMade love to it, and in my rapture broke it !Esther, if you knewESTHER.Knew what ?HANS.Nay, nothing.You take me up so snappishly ! I am sure1 bear you much good will I say but GOOD6 THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. [ACT i.Because I am afraid to tell you whatI bear you ; and when you intreat me harshlyI can't endure it, but it brings my heartInto my throat, that I begin to choke,And then I fall a-crying. Don't you seeI'm crying now and wiping of my eyes?ESTHER.A fly has got into them.HANS.Do you sayA flv ? I would it were so small a thing !I would it were a gnat, a wasp, a hornetBetter be stung by anything than Esther.A fly indeed ! I would it were a flyIt was no fly ! O Esther, if you knew !ESTHER.Knew what ? What dost thou mean ?HANS.Alack-day !ESTHER.Go clean the knives and forks ! stamping at him.)HANS.They are made of steel,And steel is hard, and, if it is, no wonder.'Tis steel and 'tis its nature ! 'Tis not soWith human hearts, for they are flesh and blood,Whereof was never made, nor will be made,Nor can be made, a knife and fork, and yetNo steel at times is harder ! 'Tis a pity.ESTHER.Is all that silver cleaned ?HANS.How sweet a soundSCENE i.] THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. 7Has silver ! Yet 'tis heat proof. Without fearYou dip it in a pot of boiling broth,Which you can not the tongue, and yet how harshThe tongue will sometimes sound !E s T H E R stamping.Have you your wits ?HANS.Yes ! No ! I only have a part of them.I'll tell you where the other part is goneIf you will let me.ESTHER.Well, Sir?HANS.If you knewESTHER stamping more violently.Begone, I'll never know ! (HANS goes out.) What does hemean?The creature's not in love with me ? Ne'er yetMet I the man was bold enough to woo me.And that among bold men and would he try,Whom nature by mistake did frame a man,And give a chicken's heart to ? I should likeTo see him woo me ! Why I have ta'en his part,As doth a mother her girl-petted boy'sA thousand times saved him from kicks and beatingsFought for him while he has stood by and crow'dTo see me win his battle -" If I knew !"I half suspect the thing's in love with me !And, now I think on't, for this month or twoThe boy is alter'd wondrously ! He sighs,And sighs ! and mumbles to himself, and goesMoping about the house. Sure as I live,The boy's in love, and I'm to have a husband !8 THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. [ACT i.I, to whom man durst never say a soft thingThe second time ! A husband ! I shall dieAt the thought (laughs). Make Hans my husband (laughs)then the endO' th' world were come (laughs). O dear ! my sides will crackWith laughter ! Esther go to church with Hans !Take oath to love, to honour, and obey him ! (laughs)Yes, with a curtsey ! and then take him homeIn my apron ! Esther become wife to Hans ! (laughs)Hans husband unto Esther ! (laughs). Husband ! (laughs)Husband !Enter MADAME ROSELHEIM.MADAME ROSELHEIM.Why, Esther, what's the matter ?ESTHER still laughing.I'm laughing !MADAME ROSELHEIM.I see you are. What makes you laugh ?Esther R laughing.A thoughtThat came into my head.MADAME ROSELHEIM.Dismiss it thenBehoves you to be busy with grave matters.Your master leaves us. He is summoned henceBy sudden requisition of high duty.ESTHER.How soon ?MADAME ROSELHEIM.At once. Prepare for his departure.ESTHER.Goes Meetaa with him ?SCENE i.] THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT.MADAME ROSELHEIM.No, nor any one.A secret mission takes him for the serviceOf her, the Royal dame, who was his mistress.ESTHER.And how will Meetaa bear it ?MADAME ROSELHEIM.As she ought.Meetaa knows nothing paramount to duty.ESTHER.And this to fall upon the very eveOf her wedding. Will it stop it ?MADAME ROSELHEIM.I don't know.ESTHER.I hope it will not ; I have fear of crossesIn all such matters.MADAME ROSELHEIM.Thickest thou of weddings ?ESTHER stifling a laugh.Madam !MADAME ROSELHEIM.Why, Esther, what's the matter with you ?ESTHER.Nothing ! That is Unless I laugh I'll die !Goes out, laughing imoMADAME ROSELHEIM.What's come to her ? "Tis not her mood to laughAt such a time too. But I have not thoughtTo waste on her. A dangerous mission thisA search unauthorized ; and that, with foesOn every side of him. The reverend manFor duty puts his life in jeopardy,10 THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. [ACT i.Nor pauses, but as soon as calf obeys.His daughter on the eve of marriage too,As Esther said her bridegroom daily looked for,My son my Rupert fit to mate a princess,But yet more fitly with sweet Meetaa raatch'd,In virtue without peer ! Will he postponeTheir nuptials? No, he will not, if I know him.But whatsoever he resolves is wise ;For piety is still the good man's law. [ Goes out.SCENE II. A ROOM IN MUHLDENAU's HOUSE.Enter MUHLDENAU.MUHLDENAU.Meetaa ! I thought she was alone with me !No wonder if the news transfixes herWith deep abstraction, newly told ; when I,Already in possession on't, alikeForget myself ! Why, Meetaa ! Come, my child.Meet entering.And must you go ?MUHLDENAU.The voice that calls me henceI never disobey'd durst disobey !Thou art here in safety. This, thy father's will,From want assures thee leaves thee heir indeedTo modest competence. Thy nuptials too,Which, for this chance I would not have postponed.Give thee a father in a husband. ThusAbsolved from care on thy account, I go ;For thou art good, my child, and hast besideSCENE ii.] THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. 11A Father whom thou lowest to obey,With power no less than will to guard his child,That trusts in him in every place at hand,At every hour the Father of thy father !In whose strong hands, and pitiful as strong,I leave thee, saying, " Let his will be done!"Meet.Will you be long away ?MUHLDENAU.Not long, I hope ;Not very long. What call you long, my child ?A year ?Meet.O, not a year !MUHLDENAU.No ! no ! No fearOf that. No ; certainly I shall not beA year away.Meet.Not half a year ?MUHLDENAU.Not halfA year.Meet.Half that?MUHLDENAU.I know not, but should thinkA lapse more brief should bring me home again.Meet.Perhaps a month ?MUHLDENAU.Perhaps ; but graver thingsLie in the hands of seconds. Yea; a second12 THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. [ACTMight balk departure, yet remove me from thee,Never again to meet thee in this worldIn this world, Meetaa ! so, think less of absence,That here hath termination.Meet.Is the missionThat takes you, dangerous ?MUHLDENAU.I'll not deceive you ;It is.Meet.Sweet Heaven have mercy !MUHLDENAU.It is wellTo call for that but better 'tis to knowThat what Heaven wills is right ! Believe in that,Thou 'It find it in the end to thy account.But what is danger? Isn't always the thingWe call so ? Sin is danger, certainly,Putting in jeopardy man's proper life,The life to come ! but what is danger else ?J Tis hard to say ! Of this, howe'er, be sure,More oft it wears a smooth face than a rough,So for the most part found when least expected,And fatalist ! The storms that are foretoldAre easiest met the reefs avoidedThat raise the ripple ! He did not feast that nightWho saw the writing, to the prophet's mindExplain'd alone, although revealed to all ;And while the impious revel yet held onThe flood did turn its wave, to let the surgeOf battle in, and ruin overthrewHim and his kingdom ! Hear me, Meetaa ; gladSCENE ii.] THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. 13This summons makes me, tho' it threatens danger ;And, for I know that it will hearten theeTo bear my absence, I will tell thee why.Sit down, my child. Thou hadst a sister, Meetaa.Meet.A sister ?MUHLDENAU.I have kept the knowledge from thee,To save the questioning had followed it,And could not be replied to without costOf suffering, while recollection ofBereavement yet was young.Meet.I had a sister ?MUHLDENAU.You had a sister.Meet.Had?MUHLDENAU.Had, Meetaa.Meet.Had!Alas ! was I so rich, and knew it not ?I had a sister ! O what light and warmthOf love, I never knew before, the thoughtHath shot into my soul ! And now and now,All's strangely dark and cold ! How is it, father,I had a sister, and remember not ?MUHLDENAU.Because 'twas in thy childhood, Meetaa, whenThe memory, too tender, yields impressionsTheir causes ta'en away. And yet there wasA time thou didst remember such a thing !14 THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. [ACTMeet.Was there? O heartless Meetaa ! Once rememberShe had a sister, and forget it ever !MUHLDENAU.Thou hast forgot the siege of Magdeburg.Meet.No ! I remember that ! I never hearThe thunder, but I think of that ! or seeThe lightning set the sky on fire, but thatComes back to me ! No ! no ! I recollectThe siege of Magdeburg !MUHLDENAU.How long did it last ?Meet.One night.MUHLDENAU.Three months !Meet.I only recollectOne night and it was in the street, and menWith horrid looks and yells ran to and fro !On horseback some, and some on foot some firing,And some with swords which they did whirl and dartAs they moved on.MUHLDENAU.Ay ! mercy shewed they notThat night to man or woman !Meet.Woman ? No !I saw them seize one by the hair ! I am sureI did!MUHLDENAU.You did you told me so yourself.SCENE ii.] THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. 15Meet.I told you so myself ?MUHLDENAU.You have forgot !And can you wonder? You were barely thenTurned five years old. Were you not near that woman?Meet.Yes ! close to her ! I had a hold of her.MUHLDENAU.That too you told me. Do you not remember ?Meet.No.MUHLDENAU.No ! not when I found thee in the streetWandering alone, and 'twixt thy sobbing, onThy father calling ?Meet.No.MUHLDENAU.Thou oldest it meThe following day, and often afterwards.I let the fruitless inquisition drop,So memory fell asleep ! Remembers aughtThat woman carried ?Meet.Carried ?MUHLDENAU.Carried.Meet.No.MUHLDENAU.She was thy sister's nurse.16 THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. [ACT iMeet.It was a childShe carried ! Was it ? Yes ! I see it nowIn her arms, as plain as I see you. O, heart !What hast thou been about ? All's clear as noon !A child she carried, and it was my sister !I recollect my sister ! Were they killed ?MUHLDENAU.The woman was.Meet.And not my sister ?MUHLDENAU.ThatKnows Heaven alone ! That night of carnage over,We searched the street the woman's body found,But of thy little sister not a trace !Meet.And you did search the street ? She was not kill'd !Had she been killed, her body had been foundSure as the nurse's Yes ! and I have heardNine times in ten, when caught in mortal straitA woman with an infant in her arms,Altho" she lose herself, will save her load !She was not kiird, for didn't I escape !I that did wail and clamour as you say !They hurt not me whom else soever they hurt ;And would they harm a little speechless child,As like to smile at them as look afraidTo come to them, if it could walk, as fly ?'Tis not in mortal man that has his wits,To slay a little harmless, witless child !To wound it, scratch ! I would stake my lifeShe was not kill'd Some one did snatch her upSCENE ii.] THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. 17Take her away put in a place of safetyGod bless him ! cherishes her now perhapsAs if she were his own ! Do you not thinkShe is alive ? I'm sure she is alive ;I have a sister still !MUHLDENAU.Thy sanguine heartA little light enlarges into day.It is thy father's nature which thou hast,Unchecked in thee, in him subdued by time.Now see'st thou why this summons is a thingTo welcome ? Hitherto my debt to thee,My yearnings for my lost one still has heldIn check yes, yearnings, Meetaa ; for I ownThe likeness, tho' a faint one, of thy hope,Touching thy sister, round thy father's heartHath ever hung ! but now that I am call'd,Commanded for 'tis even so, my childTo leave thee tho' the track I must pursueBorders with danger, yet it is a journeyI undertake more pleased, than I'd forego!For if we may believe in presagesAnd wherefore not if we believe at all,As who shall shape and bound the ways of heavenTo other issue than its proper one,And nearer to myself this mission leadsPerhaps concerning thee ! perhaps Yes, Meetaa,I cannot help the thought, for, next to thee,It is the stay of my old age perhapsConcerningMeet.My lost sister.18 THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. [ACT i.MUHLDENAU.Yes, my child,Not dead, 1 do believe, but lost. How wellYou reason'd on't ! The body was not found :A nurse, as thou did'st say, will lose herself,Yet save her load 'tis not, I do believe,In flesh and blood to slay a little child :You're right, the child was saved is living yet !You have made your father turn a boy again !Well, be it so ! I do believe it, Meetaa !You are content, my child, to let me go ?Meet.I am, sir that is, not, as at the first,My heart grows sick at thought of losing you.Could net I go too ? No no ! There is danger,And that's my answer. Farewell, father ! There !We'll say good-bye at once !MUHLDENAU.Not yet, my child !Should'st thou require a friend when I'm away,Here is the name of one He lives in Prague :He is a Jew.Meet.A Jew?MUHLDENAU.He'll give thee counsel,Should'st thou have need of it.Meet.A Jew?MUHLDENAU.Or ifThy funds run low in sudden exigence,He'll help them mount again.SCENE TI.] THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. 19Meet.A Jew? pMUHLDENAU.Why not ?Meet.And I a Christian father's child !MUHLDENAU.Is notA Jew a man ? Would'st thou, a Christian, helpA Jew, that's of thy creed an enemy ?Meet.I would !MUHLDENAU.And why not then a Jew help thee ?I know a reason ; but the blame on't liesNot on the other side. It is the raceElect from all mankind, whose course is mark'dFrom youngest time by high behests from Heaven,By miracles and oracles, and deedsOf mighty men who put their trust therein !Don't fear thy father's friend ! Don't fear the Jew !Meet.I am corrected, sir. I shall observe.MUHLDESAU.Here comes thy Rupert's mother and in time.Enter MADAME ROSELHEIM.My absence, madam, need not be a letTo stay my daughter's nuptials with thy son.I know a soldier's time is not his own ;And what is granted him, behoves him use.c220 THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. [ACT n.So, Meetaa, do not wait for my return,If past the time delayed. Farewell, my child !Madam, farewell ! We are in the hands of Heaven !\ Goes out ; and Meet, after a struggle, falls weepingupon the neck of MADAME ROSELHEIM.SCENE i.] THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. 21ACT II.SCENE I.

Is there aughtI have forgotten ? The garlands properly disposed,The seats in order, and the company,Bid as you told me ? There's the music too,Three fiddles first and second, and a bass,A hautboy, flute and harp ! Are you not pleased ?Look pleased ! Do, Esther ! Seldom do you smileOn me ; and welcomer than Christmas day,Or New Year's day, or any day o' the year,Were one kind look from Esther.ESTHER.To say truth,You have managed finely !HANS.Law ! how sweet you smile !What's honey now ? I wouldn't take a hiveTo pay foret with that smile ! Indeed I wouldn't,In very deed, I wouldn't and I'm fondOf honey ! furious fond of it. O dear !22 THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. [ACT 11.A thing so sweet to see, what must it beTo taste ? O happy days of boyhood, whenWhatever I did right was sure to get meA kiss from my mother. Times are changed with Hans ;Do what he may, he gets no kisses now.ESTHER.Now he wants me to kiss him ! So. Good Hans,'Tis not with men you know, as 'tis with boys ;Kisses do come to boys, but men must fetch them.HANS.But knew I I could get them I would fetch them !ESTHER.Why, Hans, how can you know unless you try ?HANS.Unless I try ! Now mean you what you say ?ESTHER.Why say it else ?HANS.And they'll be had by fetching ?ESTHER.A fool may tell they'll not be had without.HANS.O Esther !ESTHER.Well ?HANS.Would I could hear thee say,"Hans!"ESTHER.O Hans There, I've said it ! Well ?HANS.Durst I but try ? But then there is the fear !SCENE i.] THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT, 23ESTHER.And there's the hope ! the flower beside the weed.HANS.O Esther ! Oh.ESTHER.O Hans !HANS.Give me a kiss !ESTHER.Fool ! said I not before,Men must fetch kisses, tho 1 to boys they come ?HANS.would you fancy me a boy !ESTHER.1 do;Not only fancy thee, but know thee one !HANS.Then treat me as a boy.ESTHER.How?HANS.As you saidJust now that boys were treated.ESTHER.As I live,He'd have it come from me ! What said I now ?HANS,You said that kisses come to boys.ESTHER.I did;And so do railings, cuffs, and fifty thingsThat are not half so sweet. Did I not sayThe dance was to be practised ? Where are then24 THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. [ACT ir.The partners ? Where's the music? In a minuteThe bridegroom comes, when all should be prepared,Isn't then a time make ready ? Well ? Don't standWith gaping mouth when busy hands are neededFetch here the dancers and the music.HANS without moving.Yes.ESTHER.Is that the way to do it ? Will they comeWith only saying Yes" ? 'Art thou a post ?HANS.In sooth I know not what I am ! I knowI'm not myself ! I may be man or woman,A fish or a brute beast, a stone, or logOf wood, for what I care ! I would 'twere nowAll over with me, and the coronerWere sitting on me ! It will come to that !I'll do thy bidding then I'll go and dieI will ! I'll tie me a true-lover's knot,You'll see I will Good bye !ESTHER stamping.Hans !HANS.Well?ESTHER.Have hereThe dancers, ere I stamp my foot again.HANS.I fly. [Goes out.ESTHER.Poor Hans ! The boy is deep in love !How have I managed to light up this flame ?Heigh-ho !" " O dear !" The simpleton, 1 vow,SCENE i.] THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. 25Grows interesting. I should grieve for Hans,Were aught to happen to him. It is hardTo be the bane of a poor fellow's peace,Much more to be the death of him ! Should he goAnd drown himself ! or hang himself indeed !Hans ! (calling) I could never bear myself again !To see him laid out in his shroud ! Hans ! Hans ! (calling)To follow the poor fellow to his graveTo see him lower'd into 't. Why, Hans ! (calling) I hearThe earth upon his coffin ! Hans, I say !Where are you ?HANS entering with dancers.Here ! Is any thing the matter,You calPd me in a tone of such distress ?ESTHER recovering herself.Am I not in a hurry, and you takeAn hour and more to do a minute's work !HANS.I'm sure I'm hardly gone a minute.ESTHER.Fool !You cannot tell a minute from an hour !HANS.Here are the dancers and the music, butOne partner is a- wan ting.ESTHER.You stand up !HANS.It is a woman's wanting.ESTHER.'Tis no matter,Take you her place.26 THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. [ACT n.HANS.I'll do whatever you bid me,But wis too hard to make a woman of me.ESTHER impatiently.Are you ready ?HANS.Yes ! I'll dance him till I tire him.[Dance. HANS exerts himself to the utmost, constantlyand still more and more enjoys his vivacity. His partnergives up, and HANS dances by himself beforeESTHER, who humours his steps. The others at lengthdance off.HANS.Danced I to please you ?ESTHER.Yes ; and there your thanks. \ Kisses him.HANS.And there are yours for paying me so well ! [Kissing again.Mars ! if I haven't kiss'd her !ESTHER.Hans ! Why, Hans !HANS.Nay, don't be angry ! All the blame was yours ;You kiss'd me first. 'Twas only kiss for kiss !ESTHER.Here's some one coming ! Why, you idle boy !Nothing within, without the house, to do,That you are standing here ? No plate to clean ?No knives and forks ? no furniture to polish ?No glasses nor decanters to be rinsed,And dried, and clear'd ? When put you last to rightsYour pantry ? 'Twas in wond'rous order whenSCENE i.] THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. 27I look'd into it yesterday ! Go, sir ;A gaping mouth won't serve for busy hands !To work, I say ! Do you hear me, boy ?HANS.I do,Yet hardly can believe it.ESTHER.Hence. To work ! [HANS goes out.MADAME ROSELHEIM entering.To work? Why, Esther, 'tis a holiday !Knew you what you were saying ? Do you hear me ?Esther turned girl ! May I believe my eyesAnd they have never failed me yet I saw theeKiss the lad Hans just now ?ESTHER.'Twas he kiss'd me.MADAME ROSELHEIM.You first kiss'd him.ESTHER.Well, if I did, I did.He danced just now, and pleased me 'twas so wellAnd so I kiss'd him, as a woman mayA boy !MADAME ROSELHEIM.You are right ; you might have said a child :Hans is no more.ESTHER.Hans no more than a child ?He's twenty-five he says so next birth-day.A pretty child indeed ! If he's a child,Children are marriageable ! Such a childMy mother's husband was, when birth of meMade him a father.28 THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. [ACT 11.MADAME ROSELHEIM.Be not angry, Esther ;I did not say of Hans he was too youngTo be a husband if you fancy him.ESTHER.I fancy Hans ? I fancy living man.And Hans especially ! I, that am gallAt very thought a man should be my master !I, to whom never ventured man to saySoft thing a second time and those have triedWho have back'd furious seas, and shown a frontTo bayonet points and loaded cannon mouthsAnd I to fancy Hans ! I thank you, ma'am.Dress up a girl in boy's clothes for me, do,And send her me for husband ! Hans indeedTo call me wife ! I to call Hans my husband !How I should like to hear myself ! I'll marryWhen it rains husbands ; but it shan't be Hans !MADAME ROSELHEIM.Well, Esther, do not fret.ESTHER.I fret ! I thinkI see myself ! Fret about Hans ! I knowYou did but jest. It was a rare conceitTo say I'd marry Hans (laughs). I'll kill myselfWith laughing at the thought. Esther to marryAnd Hans, of all mankind !MADAME ROSELHEIM.You are right. 'Twas jest !I have always set you down for an old maid.Go see if Meetaa's ready.ESTHER aside.An old maid !SCENE i.] THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. 29Thank heaven I'm only five-and-thirty yet.Old maid indeed, and only thirty-five !I yet may live to be a grandmother ! \ Goes out.MADAME ROSELHEIM.No sign of Rupert yet, and noon is past.He will not come. These nuptials will be stopp'd.Her father's summons boded, as I thought,No good. There is in the affairs of life,As in the atmosphere, a season, whereTo shining day succeeded shining day ;But once the weather breaks, 'tis cloud and cloud,And long deferred and slow the clearing up.Enter MESSENGER with letters, and retires.From Rupert ! I was right he will not come :The field is ta'en a month before the time.His leave has been recall'd. Poor Meetaa ! GoUndress thee, girl ! Thy gear of every dayBelongs to this on which thou thoughts to wearThe brightest suit that virginhood puts on !This is to Meetaa from her father ? NoThe hand is strange! Why, who should write to herExcept her father ? About whom but himOr Rupert, should she hear, and he has toldHis errand in my letter ! If it speaksAbout her father, harm has falFn upon him !And what will Meetaa do ? A solid mindBut has to learn to bear a father's ills !What can have chanced ? Perhaps imprisonment !Not death ? O no ! not death ! It cannot be !Heaven, for his child's sake, for his own, will spare him.\ Goes out.30 THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT.

A ROOM IN JOSEPH'S HOUSE ATPRAGUE.Enter JOSEPH and AHAB.AHAB.More gold !JOSEPH.Yes, Ahab, more ! The dross is mine,Thou only hast the custody, and yetThou yields it me as it were drops of bloodFrom thine own heart ! I say, I want more gold,And more to follow yet, if that suffice not ;And, failing gold, I'll coin my parchments, plate,Jewels, and furniture my very roofBut I shall find supplies !AHAB.And for a Christian ?JOSEPH.Thou art my brother Jew. What could'st thou moreThan risk thy life for mine ?AHAB.I do not knowWhat greater venture man can risk for manThan his own life.JOSEPH.Would'st thou risk thine for me ?Thou art honest, Ahab, though thou lov'st thyself42 THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. [ACT in.Better than any living thing beside.Thou pauses to consider ! Do not pause,'Tis waste of time which I will save thee. Ahab,Thou would'st not risk thy life for me. Now mark,When I did suffer persecution,Ten years ago, in Spain, when Christian men,In their Master's name, did that which never yetTheir Master's precepts warranted I say it,For it is written, Ahab, written, plainThat he who runs may read when Christian menGave human, living flesh to roast, becauseWe held the old faith and eschewed the new,The Christian father of this Christian childDid save my life at peril of his own !Get the gold, Ahab ! He did that for me,That was not of his creed, thou would'st not do,Who art of mine ! Ahab, I felt it then,The Master taught them right ! He is my neighbourThat does a neighbour's office to me !The gold, and plenty on't a hundred ducats !AHAB.A hundred ducats ?JOSEPH.'Tis the twentieth partOf what remains ! A portion of his lifeHe did not risk, but all. Resolve at onceTo do my bidding, else my mind may change,And I may bid thee fetch the whole, the whole !A prompt compliance in a strait is best.Where others have the power to make conditions,Resistance tires forbearance. Fetch the gold,For the sake of him who saved the hands that made itFrom the fire. Look here ! they are not cinders, Ahab,SCENE i.] THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. 43But flesh ; and thank a Christian. Fetch the gold !AHAB goes out.Poor girl ! how she has wasted since she firstCame here : yet how her spirit lasts beyondHer body : there she suffers no impairment.My Rachel had been like her had she lived,The face reminds me of her as it shinesFrom the thick bower of her raven hair,When now and then by chance I see it down IEnter Meet.What news, my girl ?Meet.None ! I have sped to-dayAs yesterday ! The names of father, child,Seem here to carry to men's hearts no importPast that of lightest words. They hardly winAn audience for me. When they do, the eyeOf the listener, every other moment caughtBy passing trivial' st things, admonishesMy tongue it only wastes an earnest suitUpon a heedless ear. Once, as I thought,An auditor was moved, almost he seem'dTo give me hope, I felt as if aboutTo cross the threshold of the prison, andBlessings and thanks rose in my throat so thick,That utterance did suffocate, and, butFor tears that sudden came to my relief,I had fallen at his feet, yet at that very momentSome antic feat I saw not, but a wretchDid practise within view, convulsed him straightWith laughter, 'mid the peals of which he left me,As I had ne'er been standing there ! A clapOf thunder had not stunned me half so much.44 THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. [ACT in.JOSEPH.Was he a sentinel ?Meet.He was.JOSEPH.I wonderWhat sentinel did keep his heart, to letIncontinent and ribald folly in,And pity standing weeping at the door !Meet.They are all alike !

No ! while my father lives,I'll never give up hope to save his life !JOSEPH.A girl and proof against despondence thus !Meet,I often fear you deem me hard of heart.SCENE i.] THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT. 45Perhaps you think I do not weep enough ?It is not that I could not weep it isThat I won't weep that I won't give way that I'll keepMy spirit up my thoughts about me wasteNaught that my father wants. I can't affordTo be a child, and melt. No ! I must beA deliverer, and proof to dissolvementAs a rock ! I have not shed a single tearBut as a prayer except to-day, when I gasp'd,And must have wept or dropped, and even thenIt came of itself ! Thou said'st just now thou fear'd'stThere was no hope ? but there is ! I came resolvedTo keep it from thee, promise had so oftEnticed belief to balk it. I have a chanceTo see the daughter of the Governor.JOSEPH.How came this blessed chance ?Meet.Ha ! blessed sayst thou ?Perhaps 'twill prove so ! The poor human heart,How it doth build, and build on slightest grounds !Words dropp'd by chance to pass for prophecies !We'll pray it may be bless'd we then may hope it !Well, I will tell you.JOSEPH.Hope begins to dawn !Meet.Didn't I say there was no fear of hope ?I went, as every day I yet have done,To the Governor. The man that open the gateWas a new warder. A new face, new hope !I told my tale, and when 'twas done implored him46 THE MAID OF MARIENDORPT.

A quarter of an hourHad ta'en thee here and back.Meet.And in that timeHis mind had changed, or he had been removed,And in his place another put, and allHad been to do again, and that, perhapsWith lessen'd chance.
