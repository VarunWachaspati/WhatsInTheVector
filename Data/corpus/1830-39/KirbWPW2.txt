Cirripedes andCrinoideans.CIRRIPEDES.1 HERE is a class of animals defended by multi-salveshells, separated from the MoUuscans notonly by the more complex structure of theirshells, but also by very material differences inthe organization of the creatures that inhabitthem. These Linn considered as forming asingle genus, which he named Leas, a wordderived from the Greek lexicographers, andexplained by Hesychius ad meaning a kind ofshell-fish that adheres to the rocks. In thiscountry these animals are known by the generalname of Barnacles. Lamarck, I believes wasthe first who regarded them as entitled to theTOL. II. B2 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.rank of a class, which he denominated Cirr-hipeda, not conscious, that by the insertion ofthe aspirate, he made his term, like MofwculuSjhalf Greek and half Latin : later writers whohave adopted the class, to avoid this barbarism,have changed the term to Cin^hopoda, but asthis gives a different meaning to the word,changing fringed or tendriUlegs^^ very happilyexpressing the most striking character of theanimals intended, into yellow-legs^^ which doesnot indicate any prominent feature, I shall,after Dr. Leach and Mr. W. S. Mac Lay,omitting the aspirate, call them Cirripeda^ orCirripedes.These animals have a soft body, protected bya multi valve shell. They are without eyes, orany distinct head ; have no powers of locomotion,but are fixed to various substances. Theirbody, which has no articulations, is envelopedin a kind of mantle, and has numerous vernaculararms, consisting of many pouts, fringed oaeach side, and issuing by pairs from jointedpedicles : their mouth is armed with transversetoothed jaws in pairs, which, like the mandibleof the Crustaceans, are furnished with a livelier ;they have a knotty longitudinal spinal chord ;gills for respiration.; and for circulation a heartand vascular system.J Lat. Cirri, * Gr. Ktppoc*CIRRIPEDES. 3This clam is divided into two Orders.1. The JirH consists of the Lepadites^ orGroose-barnacles/ the species of which are distinguishedby a tendinous, contractile, and oftenlong tube, fixed by its base to some solid marinesubstance, supporting a compressed shell, conssitting of valves united to each other by membrane,and by having six pairs of tentaculararms. They are usually found in places ex-«posed to the fluctuations of the waves. Onegenus' appears to perforate rocks to form ahabitation. These animals roll up and unrolltheir arms with great velocity, thus creating alittle whirlpool, that brings to their mouth anabundant supply of animalcules, an actionwhich Poll compares to fishermen casting a net.Some species, instead of shell, are covered bya membranous sac, having occasionally veryminute shelly valves2. The second Order of Cirripedes consists ofthe Balances or Acorn-barnacles, which are distinguishedfrom the Lepadites by a shelly, insteadof a tendinous tube, the mouth of whichis closed by an operculum, usually consisting offour valves. The animals of this Order arecommonly regarded as sessile ; but, if Lamarckis right in considering the valves of the shell ofthe Lepadites as analogous to the operculum of> Anatifa* Pentetasmis, Sec. < Lithotrya,Anatifa cariacea et leporina.4 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.the Balanites, as it seems to be, and their tendinoustube as really a part of the body of theanimal — as its being organized, living, and muscular,seems to prove — then it must be analogousto the shelly tube of the latter, and both mustbe considered as elevated by a footstalk. Thistube, in the Balanites, consists usually of sixpieces, soldered, as it were, together; and inseveral species, as in the common sea-adorns ofa triangular shape, and having their acuteangle alternately at the base and at the mouth ofthe tube. The base of the tube generally takesthe form of the bodies upon which it is fixed,and is sometimes composed of shell, sometimesof membrane, and sometimes it is incomplete.The animal, in this Order, has twenty-four tentaculararms, shorter than those of the Lepadites,consisting of two sorts, namely, six pairs oflarge similar ones, but unequal in size, placedabove; and as many smaller pairs, dissimilarand unequal, and placed below. One pair ofthese is much larger than the others. In thewater they keep these tentacles in perpetualmotion, and thus arrest, or, by producing a currentto their mouth, absorb the animalcules,,which constitute their food. They not only fix^ Balance Tintinnabulum,2 These organs, though called tentacles, from their use, seemrather analogous to the antenTUB and other jointed organs ofCondy lopes.GIRRIPEDE8. Od^niBelyes upon inanimate substances, such asrocks, stones, the hulls of ships, &c* but alsoupon various marine animals and plants. Thussome are found on Zoophytes, as sponges andmadrepores; others attached closely to eachother on shell-fish, especially bivalves, so closelythat the point of a pin cannot be thrust between-them. One species takes its station on the shellof the turtles others plant themselves in theflesh of the seal ; and others bury their tube inthe unctuous blubber of the whaleIf we compare the animals of the above Orderswith each other, we shall find that they are fittedby their Creator to collect their food in differentways; The Lepadites^ by means of their longcontractile flexible tube, can rise or sink, andhead, themselves in different directions, so as, insome sort, to pursue their prey ; their tentacles,also, from their greater length, seem to furtherthis end: these, according to Poll's metaphorabove alluded to, they can throw out and drawin. laden with fry, as a fisherman does his net.When their prey is in their mouth, it is subjectedto the acton of their toothed jaws, which seemmore numerous and powerful than those of theBalanites ; and as the valves forming the shellare more numerous and connected by membrane,and the whole shell more compressed than theoperculum of the last named animals, we mayCorona testudinaria.FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.suppose that they are capable of a more variationsand one that may perhaps add to the momentumof the masticating organs. Hence wemay conjecture that the animals destined toform their nutriment, may be laisser, so as torequire more exertion and force, both to takeand to masticate.In the other Order, the structure of the Sorunites seems to indicate merely the protrusionand employment of their tentacles ; and beingusually attached to floating bodies, such as thehulls of ships, or parasitic upon locomotive animals,riding as they do upon the back of theturtle, the dolphin, and the whale, they may visitvarious seas in security, and feast all the while,with little trouble and exertion, upon animalculesof every description, the produce of arctic,temperate, and tropical seas.With respect to their place in nature, it seemsnot quite dear whether they should be regardedas leading from the MoUuscans, with whichCuvier arranges them, towards the Crustaceans,and they certainly seem to have organs borrowedfrom both ; their shells and mantle insome degree from one, and their palpigerousmandibles and jointed organs, proceeding inpairs from a common footstalk — like the interiorantennae of the lobster — and knotty spinal chordfrom the other : but with respect to their jointedorgans, I must observe that they still moreCIRRIPBDES. 7doB^ Kemble rhode of some of the Encri-mte8»^ like than being fringed on each side,though not with organs of that description. Alearned naturalist, Mr. W. S. Mac Leay, is ofopinion that the Echinidans, or sea urchins, exhibitsome approximation to the Balanites.^ If,indeed, we compare the genus Caronula with anEehimtSj we shall discover several points inwhich their structure agrees. We learn fromLamarck, that the pieces of the so called operculum,which close the mouth of the formershell, are affixed rather to the animal than tothe shell. Thus the operculum, in some sort,represents the jaws of an Echinus, though consistingof fewer pieces, and the tube appearsdivided into alleys, like the crust of that animal*These circumstances seem to prove some affinitybetween the Cirripedes and Radiaries; theyappear also to have some points in common withl^vigny's Nereideans, especially AmphitriteWeighing all these circumstances, I have thoughtit best to place the Cirripedes immediately hefore the Entomostracan Crustaceans.But what if these Cirripedes should at lastprove to be, not the guides to the great Crustaceanhost, but its legitimate progeny ? This hasbeen asserted, at least partially, by a modernzoologist, who has assigned his reasons for this1 See Plate III. B. Fio. 1.« Hor.EnUi.^VZ. ' Ibid.8 FUNCTIONS AND InstinctsSingular and startling opinion. I will not saythe thing is impossible — for with Gk>d all thingsare possible — but it certainly appears in thehighest degree improbable. That a 2k>ea shouldbecome a crab is sufficiently extraordinary, andan opinion, as Latreille remarks, which, if it benot erroneous, has great need of support fromexperiment :^ but that a locomotive animal,gifted with eyes and legs, should, by an extraordinarymetamorphosis, in its perfect state, becomea barnacle, without head, eyes, or como*time organs, can never be admitted till confirmedby repeated experiments of the most able andpractised zoologists, so as to place the matterbeyond dispute. I by no means, however, meinto assert that Mr. Thompson did not think hesaw what he has stated, in both cases, to takeplace, but he was probably deceived by appearancesin some such way as he states Slabber tohave been.*A single fact, observed by Poli, is sufficient tooverturn this whole hypothesis. This illustriousconchologist relates that he had an opportunityof examining the immense fecundity of thesessile barnacles. '^ In the beginning of Junehe found innumerable aggregations of them,covering certain boats that had been long stationary,which, when closely examined, were soCours D^EntamologiCy i. 385.ZooL Research.

These very minute ones musthave beni hatched from the egg, and not producedfrom larves.With r^ard to the functions and instincts ofthese Cirripedes, very little has been observed*We see from the above account of them, thatlike many other animals amongst ,the lowestgrades of the animal kingdom, they are furnishedwith particular oigans adapted to thecapture of animalcules and other minor inhabitantsof the deep, which they help to keepwithin due limits. Probably they act upon thesubstances to which they attach themselves, andpromote the decomposition of shells, and otherexuviae of defunct animals, and also of the rocksand ligneous substances on which they take then:station.

The Marsupites^ as Mr. Mantel,after Mr. Miller, has observed, form the linkwhich connects the proper or pedunculatedCcinoideans with the Stelleridans. If we com*pase them again with the class last described,the CuripedeMf especially the Lepadites^ we shallfind several points which they possess in common.In the first place both sit upon a footstalk, thoughsofa different structure and substance ; the animalin both, in its principal seat, is protected byshelly pieces or valves; the head or mouth inboth, is surrounded by dichotomizing articulatedorgans, involuted, and <^en converging at thesummit and fringed on each side, in the Crinoi*deans, with a series of lesser cogitations, and inthe Cirripedes with a dense fringe of hairs. Ifthe opinion of Mr. W. S. Mac Leay, stated above,Pirate III. B. Fig. 1. ' Pob^pi nathaniel;13 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.that some ^f the Echinoderms exhibit an approximationto some of the Cirripedes is correct,as it seems to be, the CrindideanSj thoughstill far removed, would form one of the linksthat concatenate them ; or if their connection isthought merely analogical, the Balanites wouldbe the analogues of the Echinida$u and of thesessile Crindideans, and the Lepadites oi thepedunculated ones.The following characters distinguish the to which Tribe all the known recentspecies belong.Aninudf consisting of an angular flexiblecolumn, composed of numerous joints, articulatingby means of cartilage, and perforated forthe transmission of a siphon or intestinal canal,and sending forth at intervals, in whorls, severalarticulated cylindrical branches, curving into ahook at their summit ; fixed at its base, and supportingat its free extremity a cup-like body,containing the mouth and larger viscera, consistingof several pieces, terminating above in five(or six) dichotomizing, articulated, seini*cylin*trial arms, fringed with a double series oftentacular jointed dotations, furnished belowon each side with a series of minute suckers ;these arms, when expanded, resemble a star offive (or six) rays, and when they converge, apentapetalous or hexapetalous IQiaceous flower.The whole animal, when alive, is supposed to beCRINOIDEANg. 13invested with a gelatinous muscular integument.In the specimen figured by Mr Elis, and thatin the Hungarian Museum, there appear to besix uns springing from the. so-called pelvis, butthe natural number appears to hervey correspondding with the diagonal column. Mr. Millerseem to be of opinion that the species describedby M. Guettard, and that which he has himselffigured, are the same species, and synonymouswith the Isis Asteria of Linn and the JEncrinusCaput MeduMB of Lamarck, but to judge fromthe figures of the first in Parkinson and of theother in Miller,' compared with that which isgiven in this works the last seems to differ Ifrom both, as well in the pelvis, as in the dicho-tories, and length of the arms; its suckerslikewise appear to be circulars and not angularas they are described by Mr. Miller under thename of plates If this observation turns outcorrect, I would distinguish the last species bythe name of Pentacrinus Astei^.The stem of the Crinoideans consists of numerousjoints, united by cartilages, which exhibitseveral peculiarities ; in the first place the upperand under side is beautifully sculptured, so as toresent a star of five rays, or a pentapetalous^ Organic Remains ii. t. xix,f. 1. * Crinotdea^ 48. t. 1.» Plate III.

For the transmissionof the siphon, weber a spinal chord, or intestinalcanal, or both, each joint of the column isperforated, the aperture being round in some,and floriform in others. The whole stem, withits whorls of brambles, exhibits a striking reset*bknce to the branch of the common horse-taii.^The entire structure seems calculated to enablethe animal to bend its stem, which appears verylong, in any direction, like the Lepadites, andthus as it were to pursue its prey; we maysuppose that the branching arms, fingers, andtheir lateral oi^ans, when they are extendedhorizontally and all expanded, must form anamie net, far exceeding that of the Cirripedes,which, when they have their prey within itcircumference, by converging their arkns, andclosing all their digitations, and employing theirsuckers, they can easily so manage as to preventthe escape of any animal inducted within themeshes of their net.With regard to their functions, and what ardent.« CRINOIDEANS, 15mala their Creator has given a charge to themto keep within dae limits, little can be known byobservation ; as nothing like jaws has been discoveredin them, in which they differ from theCinipedes, it should seem that either their foodmost consist of animalcules that require no mastication,or, if they entrap larger animals, thatthey must suck their juices, which seems to beMr. Miller's opinions This idea is rendered notimprobable by the vast number of suckers bywhich their fingers, and their lateral branchesor tentacles as they are called, are furnished ; bythese they can lay fast hold of any animal toopowerful to be detained in their net by anyother means, and subject it to the action of theirproboscis.From the great rarity of recent species ofthese animals, it should seem that the metropolisof their race is in the deepest abysses of theworld of waters. '' It appears," says Bosc,^'* that the species were extremity numerous inthe ancient wcNrld, perhaps, those actually inexistenceare equally so, for I suspect that allinhabit the depths of the ocean, a place in whichthey may remain to eternity without beingknown to man."Naturalists very often, too hastily, regardspecies as extinct, that are now found only inCHnoidea, 54. « N.

' RoHfera, ^ Cirrhopoda,ENTOMOSTRACAN CONDYLOPES. 17I cannot help thinking, however — taking thewhole of their organization and structure intoconsideration, particularly their powers andmeans of locomotion and prehension — that it isbest to regard those animals having jointed legsand, mostly, a body formed of two or more segmentsas constituting a separate Sub-kingdom.This is the view that my late illustrious andlamented friend, Latreille, has taken of thisgreat group, named by him, from the above circumstance,Condyhpesy^ which term, since thatof Anntdose aninialsy^ sometimes used, is synonymouswith Annelidansj I shall adopt in thepresent work.The distinctive characters of this great group,or Sub-kingdom, may be given in few words :Animal, not fixed by its base, but locomotive.Body in the great majority, consisting of twoor more segments.Legs jointed.The first of these characters distinguishes theCondyhpes from the last class, the Cirripedesjwhich are fixed by their base, whereas the presenttribe are more free in their motions thanmost of the animals of the preceding groups ; andthe two last from the AnnelidanSj which, thoughannulated, are not inserted, and have no jointedlegs.1 Ccndylopa, from xov^vkoif joints, and wove, a foot.Annulo8a»VOL. II. C18 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.Cuvier, Latreille, and most other zoologists,consider this section of the animal kingdom, assubdivided into three great Classes — Cf-crustaceans,Arachnidafis^ and Insects : Dr. Leach, taking therespiratory organs for his guide, also begins withthree primary Sections, those, namely, whichhave gills those which have sacs and thosewhich have trachea, for respiration ; and out ofthese he forms five Classes, viz. CrustaceansAracknoidans^ Weariness Myriapods, and Insects*The first and last of these Classes he furthersubdivides, each into two Sub-classes : the Cis*oceans into Entamostracans and Malacostracans ;and Insects into Ametabolians and Metabolians^or those that do not undergo a metamorphosis,and those that do. So that according to hisprimary Section his system is temaiy ; accordingto his secondary it is culinary ; and accordingto his tertiary it is septenary. I shall mostlyfollow him in each of these last subdivisions.Having made these remarks upon the Condy-lopes in general, I must now proceed to one ofthe Classes above enumerated : but here, at first,it seems difficult to ascertain which ought to beregarded as forming the first step in an ascendingseries, — a difficulty, indeed, which oftenarrests the course of the student of the woiics ofhis Creator, for, when any one, in a philosophicspirit, after a careful survey, sits down to tracethe paths by which Divine Wisdom seems toENTOMOSTAACAN CONDYLOPES. 19have passed in the creation, and the arrangementand connection of the various groups oforganised beings, he is lost and bewildered in amost intricate and mazy labyrinth, in whichpaths intersect each other at every angle, andwhen he thinks he is travelling in a straightroad he often comes to branches leading off fromit, which render it uncertain in which directionhe ought to proceed, in order best to attain theobject he is pursuing.Such indeed is the perplexity of animatednatoie, that it is impossible to see clearly thearrangement of the objects that constitute eitherthe vegetable or the animal kingdom; and inorder to get any tolerable notion of them, asGod has placed them, when we have reached acertain station we are c^n obliged to retrograde,and begin a branch, from the point ci itsdivergent, &x removed from that to which wehave arrived.Ilatimlle, in the last edition of the Ligne Am-nudedivides his Crustaceans into two Sul>classes,die first of which, after Aristotle, he denominatesMalacastracans ;^ and the second, after Miller,Emtomastracans :^ these, on account of a connectionwhich seems to exist between them and theKu^-crab^^ he places immediately bore theAraehsiidams. * I agree with this learned entomb* Entomostraca.lAmMlus Polyphemus.20 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.logistt in considering them as inferior to theproper Crustaceans, and shall therefore beginthe Condyle group with some account ofthem. Like the industry animalcules, theyform a kind of centre, sending forth rays to differentpoints, some inclosed in a bivalve shell,seeming to tend towards the MoUuscans ; ^ othersassuming more of the Crustacean form ; ^ a thirdlooking to the Arachhidans ; ^ and a fourth to theThysanuran^ or Sugar-louse tribe ;^ with otherforms that might be enumerated, some of whichare perfectly anomalous, so that it appears almostindifferent where they are placed. As there is,however, evidently some affinity between the En*tomostracans and the Cirripedes, not only in bothbeing furnished with jointed organs for theirmotions, but also in some of the former beinginclosed in shells, and in others by the briskagitation of their legs, producing a current inthe water to their mouths, as De Geer states ofthe Water-flea : ^ this furnishes a further argumentfor placing them next to the latter tribe.It is difficult, and next to impossible, to fixupon any characters that are common to thewhole of this remarkable Class. Generallyspeaking, but not invariably, they are coverednot by a calcareous and solid, but by a hornyand thin integument. They vary considerablyCypress &c. ' Branches.

Dtf Qetr, vii. 453.ENTOMOSTRACAN CONDYLOPE8. 21in the number of their antennae and legs, theformer often branching, and used as oars,and the latter usually being connected withtheir respiration, evincing the analogy betweenthese legs and the cilia of the Rotatories, andtentacles of the Polypes ;* in the majority theseorgans are not calculated for prehension. Onesoup of them lives by suction, and is parasiticupon other aquatic animals: the great body,however, masticate their food, but without theaid of maxillary legs. Their eyes are generallysessile, and a considerable number ofthem have only one, or rather two eyes envelopedby a common cornea.*LatreiUe, in his Cours D' Entomologie dividesthis Class — regarded by Linn as forming onegenus, which he named Monoculus — into sixOrders; but it will be sufficient here to adopthis division of them in the Rhgne Animalinto two, which, as separating the fresh-waterfrom the marine genera, is more simple, andbetter suited to my purpose.

The Poecilopods differ from the precedingOrder by the different structure and uses of theirlegs, which are not branching, and all of themin some, and part of them in others, are prebendaryand ambulatory, in some part are alsobranchial and natatory. They differ likewiseby not haying the ordinary mandibles and maxillae,which are scnn^imes related by the spinyhips of the six first pairs of l^s, and, in onetribe, by a mouth and oral oi^ans prop forsuction.There is a tribe of parasitic animals, whichneither Cuvier nor Latreille have inductedamongst the Entomostracans, but which Audoinand Milne Edwards conjecture are of a Crustedmean type. I am speaking of the Means ofthe author first mentioned, which he has placed,but not without hesitation, in his first orders ofIntestinal Worms.* Ht^ N<^dmann, faoweverphas made it evident that they undergo a metamorphosislittle differing finom that of the firstOrder of the Entomostracans, the Branchiopods,especially Cyclops ; and he is of opinion, that, inasystem, they would follow that genus. Therresemblance is indeed striking in their prepare^ Intestinal cavities, < EntozoUy Rut.ENT0M08TEACAN CONDYLOPES. 23oratory states, but in their last or perfect state,they differ, and like the Poecilopods, are parasitic; many of them are furnished with a veryconspicuous organ, which I shall afterwardsdescribe, for fixing themselves; and their formis very diffident, their body consisting of twosegments, like that of the Arachnidans,^ thoughattached to their abdomen, like many of theBranchiopods, they have two egg-pouches Infact the Lerneans seem scarcely more anomalousamongst the Eotomostracans, than the King-crab,and other PoBcilopods. All things consideredperhaps, they may be regarded as formingan osculant group between the two Orders.The animals of the first Order mostly frequentstagnant waters, moving about with great rapidity.They are generally regarded as predaceous,and are stated to make the industryanimalcules their prey, but some are supposedto be herbivorous, and they abound particularlyin waters in which plants are vegetating. Asthe places that they frequent are very subject tobe dried up in the summer-time, it seems pro-balethat a kind Providence has fitted them forthis event, by giving them, as well as the Infii-series, powers of reviviscence. Latreille thinksthat those of them, which, for the protection of« Plate IX. Fig. 5. ' Ihid.f.f,24 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.their slender and frail branching antenna andlegs, are enclosed in shells, have the power, afterdrawing in all their organs, of hermetically sealingtheir shells till the return of moisture.These little animals differ from the MoUuscans,and the other preceding Classes, by the changesof their integument ; they do not, like them, whentheir advance in growth requires it, add to theirshells ; but, fixing themselves to some substanceat handy they move their Urbs, and the valvesof their old shells, new ones being already formedunderneath, and thus loosening their exuviae, inashort time they cast those of the whole body ;of all their limbs, hairs, plumes, even those thatare invisible to the naked eye. Amongst theseexuviae may be detected, not merely the cast ^iaof the external parts, but that of the internalalso. These mounts follow each other at aninterval of five or six days, and it is not till afterthe third that the animal has acquired the reproductivefaculty.In the antecedent classes of the animal kingdom,which were almost all inhabitants of thewater, we have seen no instances of animalscasting their skins, or undergoing any metamorphosis— either in the number or form of theirparts— in their progress to their adult state.Some few shell-fish, indeed, are stated to casttheir shells, and form others but a degree of^ See above. Vol. I. p. 300.ENTOMOSTRACAN CONDYLOPES« 25doubt rests upon the fact. In the Branchiopods,however, a kind of metamorphosis, as well asthe moult just described, has long been noticedand recorded.The young ones of the Cyclops the animalbefore mentioned as an analogue of the sugar-louse,when first hatched have only four l^s,their body is nearly round, and has no tail,which led Miller to mistake them for species ofa different genus ; ^ soon afterwards another pairis acquired, which the same author regarded asasecond genus,^ and so it proceeds till ii assumesthe perfect form of its kind. Nordmann hasgiven figures of a very remarkable Lerneanparasites which infests the perch, representingits whole progress, from the egg to the perfectinsects which, like the Cyclops, does not acquireall its organs, except at its last metamorphosis.Our progress upwards, as far as we have atpresent proceeded, has been a gradual advance,form after form appearing upon the stage ofammal existence, each distinguished by charactersindicating an elevation as to rank andstation.

They are known to changetheir shells annually, but it has not been observedthat this moult is attended by any change ofform, or by the acquisition of new locomotive orother organs. Insects, we know, after their lastchange do not increase in size ; the Crustaceansare found, however, to vary very much in thisrespect. Whether a different law obtains amongstENTOMOSTBACAN CONDYLOPBS. 27them, from what takes place in insects, and theyfellow the Batrachian reptiles, which, after theyhare exchanged the tadpole for the frog, growtill they hare arrived at the standard of theirelective species, I cannot certainly affirm ; butreasoning from analogy, it seraos more probablethat the crustaceans should follow the law ofanimals most nearly related to them, and belongingto the same primary group, than that theyshould copy the reptiles, animals far removedfrom tiber, and of a completely different organization.There is another point in which this subjectof animal metamorphoses may be viewed. Donot these successive changes in the outwardform, functions, and locomotions of so manyumials, preach a doctrine to the attentive andduly expressed student of animal forms, andtheir history — do they not symbolically declareto him, that the same individual may be clothedwith different forms, in different states of existence,that he may be advanced, after certainpreparatory changes, and an intermediate intervalof rest and repose to a much more exaltedrank ; with organs, whether pestiferous or locomotive,of a much wider range ; with tastes nM>rerefined ; with an intellect more developed, andemployed upon hier objects; with affectionsmore spiritualized, and further removed fix>mgross matter ?28 . FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.The multiplication of these creatures, which*,like the Aphides are oviparous at one time, andviviparous at another, is sometimes prodigious,and only exceeded by that of the Industries.A female Cyclops the animal before alluded to,in the space of three months, after one fecundationwhich serves for several successive generations,lays her eggs ten times, and it has been calculatedthat from only eight of these oppositions,allowing forty for each, she might be the progenitor,incredible as it may seem, of four milliardsand a half, or four thousand five hundred incisions! ! ^ Another animal belonging to a genus ofthe present order,* was observed by CaptainKotzebue in such myriads that the sea exhibiteda red stripe, a mile long, and a fathom broad,produced by a species, individually viewed,scarcely visible to the naked eye. How astonishingis the reflection, that in so short a space, inthe case of the Cyclops, a single individualshould be gifted by its Creator to fill the waterswith myriads of animated beings, supposing asingle impregnated female at first to have beenthe surviving inhabitant of any given pool orditch. Conjecture is lost when we meditateupon the mysterious subject. How can life, asoriginally imparted, at the interval of a fewmonths be so multiplied and subdivided, as, thatLatreille Cours D^ Entomologist i. 421. ' Calamus,ENTOMOSTRACAN CONDYLOPES. 29such infinite shoals of beings shall each have ashare in the wonderful bequest. But, when wereflect that an Omnipresent Deity is every wheremighty in operation, working all in all, and thathe guide all the powers of nature, as the ridergoeth the horse upon which he sitter, to answerthe purposes of his providence ; ^ we may easilyconceive, that under his superintendence thething may be accomplished, though how it isaccomplished, must always remain an unfathomablemystery.These powers of multiplication are, however,given to these creatures for a wise and beneficentpurpose. They themselves afibrd a supply offood to a variety of creatures — to numerousaquatic insects, even polypes and worms; andto many fishes and birds, by whom their numbersare hourly and greatly diminished. As the stagnantwaters likewise, in which they abound, areapt to be dried up in the summer season, manyof them probably perish ; but, in some, animationmay be suspended till the places they inhabitare again filled with water. I have foundthe little animal described by Dr. Shaw, in theLinnean Transactions as the Cancer stagnalis ofLinii4» in horseshoes prints, in the spring, thenfilled with water, but which had been previouslyquite dry.» 1 Cor. xii. 6.

Where they abound they doubtlessgenerate diseases, and are amongst Lie meansemployed by a watchful Providence to keepwithin proper limits the inhabitants of thewaters; and probably there are oth&t benefitswhich our imperfect knowledge of their historyprevents us from duly appreciating, that are conferred,through these animals, upon the oceanicpopulation. Their prevalence upon the predaceousfishes, as was before observed, may tendto diminish their ravages by lessening their activity;while to those of a milder character,within certain bounds and under certain circumstances,they may be beneficial rather than injurious.Of this description is the tribe <^ Lemeans^above alluded to as intermediate between theBranchiopod and Poecilopod Entomostracans ; ofwhich I cannot select a more interesting speciesto exemplify the adaptation of the structureto the instinct and functions, than one describedand figured by Dr. Nordmann, under the CONDYLOPES. 31private name of Adheres Percarum^^ or Pest of thePerch.This animal, like the Branchiopods, is foundin fresh crater, where it attaches itself to thecommon » and another species of the perchgenus,* and takes its station usually within themonth, fixing itself, by means of its sucker, inthe ceilidar membrane, so deeply that it cannotdisengage itself, or be extracted by externalforce, without rupturing the so called arms, thatare attached to the sucker, and leaving it behind.The animal often fixes itself to the palate,and even to the tongue. The arms' taketheir rise at the base of the cephalothorax — asthe part consisting of head and thorax, notseparated by a suture, is called — where theyare very robust and thick, but they taper towardsthe other extremity,, a single suckerscommon to both, being, as it were, hookedto them. These arms are bent nearly intoa circle, surrounding the cephalothorax, and thesucker is in front of the head : their substance iscartilaginous, and they repose in the same planewith the head ; whence we may conjecture thatthe animal, when fixed and engaged m suction,lies close to the part where it has taken itsstation. When we consider that these breda*ceoos fishes often gorge their prey, swallowingAxBripTfg, Annoying. « Perca fluviatilis and P, luciqperca.Plati&IX. Fio.5.c,c. ♦ Plate IX.

A smallspecies of mite ^ makes them its prey, and whenthe saliva just mentioned is removed, they areoften found quite covered by a species of Industrybelonging to the genus Vorticella.The next Order, including all the marine ,will not detain us long. The firstsection consists of a single, but very remarkable,genus, the type of which is the Monoculus Polyphemusof Linn6.^ In the West Indies it iscalled, by way of eminence, the King-crahj andis found in the seas both of the East and West,from the equator to the 40th deg. of latitude.The species are few, and near to each other.They difier widely both in their characters andform from every other Crustacean tribe. Likethe Cirripedesj they have no distinct head : their1 Damascus scabriculus, * Limulus, — Mill.£NTOMOSTRACAN CONDYLOPES. 33crust is divided into two portions the anteriorembracing the posterior, and being terminated,like the Rays, to which they present an hy a long angular tail. They have bothcompound and simple eyes ; the first are situated,one in the middle of each lateral ridge, usuallyunder the spine on the outer side ; the second, orsimple eyes, are on each side of the intermediateridge, where it begins ; these last are very minute,and not easily discoverable. The undersideof the shield, or anterior portion of thecrust, is deeply hollowed for the reception of thebody, and the cavity is marked out anteriorlyby an emarginate ridge, which gives it somethingthe appearance of the hooded serpent.Some of them attain to a large size, the speciesfound near the Molucca Islands being sometimestwo feet in length.The head in them, as in the Arachnidans,seems suppressed, or to merge in the thorax,which also, as in that Class, bears the eyes, theouter pair corresponding with those of certainCrustaceans in which they are sessile, and theinner pair being like those of the Arachnidans,but they have neither the oral organs nor thelegs of the Class just named. In fact, theseanimals seem to stand in much the same positionamongst the Entomostracans, that theCephalopods do amongst the Molluscans, andmoreover as giants amongst pygmies. Time willVOL. II. D34 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.probably throw more light upon these singularworks of the Creator.Their most remarkable organ is their toes,which is probably of considerable service tothem in their locomotions. It is shaped like astiletto, and is so extremely sharp at the extremity,that it will easily pierce the flesh, andmay perhaps be used by the animal as a weapon,as it is said to be by the Indians ; it is so articulatedwith the posterior piece of the crust as tomove with more ease upwards and downwardsthan laterally. Comparing the small body withthe vast volume and levity of the crust whichcovers and protects it, and considering that theanimal, as M. Latreille has remarked, passes thenight with its anterior half out of the water, wcmay conjecture that, by the depression of thetail, it may be elevated in part above the water,and remain stationary. By a slight inclinationon either side it probably also helps to steerit, and as it is ciliated at the base, like thenatatory legs of a Dyticusj it may be of some usein swimming. The l^s are all armed with pincers,like those of a crab, from which it seemsevident that it is predaceous, and, from their smallsize, that its prey must consist of minute animals.The whole of its structure appears calculatedto give the king-crab mwe than usual buoyancy,the reasons of which, when its history is betterknown, will be more fully understood ; and theENTOMOSTRACAN CONDYLOPE8. 35Power, Wisdom, and Goodness that every whereflash upon us, when we consider animal structuresand their adaptation to their habits andinstincts, when fully investigated will be dulyappreciated* It is said that this creature,amongst the ancient Japanese, was the symbolof the zodiacal sign CancerThe animals belonging to the second section ofthe Pcecilipods differ from all the rest, by themanner in which they take their food.

But the subjectof centres in that kingdom, sending forth, as it• Callous. 2 Nicothoe.Argues. * Vol. I. p. 320.36 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.'were, rajas in different directions, and leading toVarious forms, requires very deep and minuteinvestigation, and abundant proof, before it willbe safe to adopt it as a principle.Chapter XV.CfiistMean Condytopes.We are now arrived at a Class of animals, inwhich the organs of locomotion assume a newand more perfect form corresponding in somemeasure with those of many of the vertebratedanimals. The advance, in structure, hitherto,from a mouth surrounded by organs like rays,serving various distinct purposes, and by differentmeans contributing to the nutrition, respiration,and motions of the animal, has been, bycertain inarticulate organs, more generally distributedover the body, but still in a radiatingorder ; as for instance, the tentacular suckers ofthe Stelleridans and Echinidans, which they usein their locomotions, and for prehension, as wellas the purposes just named. In the Entomb*traces, as we have seen, the legs, thoughjointed, are very anomalous, assume variousforms, and are applied to sundry uses : in theCRUSTACEAN CON DY LOPES. 37sole instance of the king-crab, they take thearticulations of those of the Crustaceans, in whichwe may trace the general structure of the legs ofthe other Classes of Condylopes.But as I shall have occasion, in a subsequentchapter, to give a concentrated account of thegradual development of the organs of locomotionand prehension, from their first rudiments in thelowest grades of the animal kingdom to theirstate of perfection in the highest, I shall nothere, therefore, enlarge further upon the subject,than by observing, that, in most of the DecapodCrustaceans, the anterior legs are becomestrictly arms terminating in a kind of didactylehand, consisting of a large joint, incrassatedusually at the base, and furnished on its innerside with a smaller moveable one, constitutingtogether a kind of finger and thumb, with whichit is enabled to seize firmly and hold strongly anyobject that its inclinations or fears point out to it.This hand we call the chela or claw, or moreproperly pincers, of the lobster or crab. Wefind it also in the scorpion and book-crabswhich on shore are in some sort analogous tothe long tailed and short-tailed Crustaceans, orlobsters and crabs of the waters. This structureof the hand, in these creatures, is particularlyfitted to their wants and situation. A hand like1 Heifer.38 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.ours, consisting of a quadruple set of fingersand an opposite thumb, to be of sufficient powerfor their purposes, must be so disproportioned totheir size, as to be an incumbrance rather than auseful instrument of prehension; but as nowconstructed, it has the requisite strength for thepurposes of the animal, without being disproportionedto its size, and inconvenient for its use.Thus we see how nicely every thing is calculatedand adjusted by Supreme Wisdom, to the natureand circumstances of every animal form.But these great claws are by no means universalamongst the Crustaceans. In some theclaws are very small, but the loss is often madeup to these by an increase as to number, so thatif they cannot lay hold of large animals, they canseize, at the same time, several small ones. Wehave seen that in the king*crab all the legshave these prehensory claws, and they vary innumber in many of the smaller Crustaceans, asthe shrimps prawn,* candle,' &c. The forelegof some of these has prehensory claws, thatare formed like the mandibles or cheliceres ofspiders and the arms of the Mantis — whencethey are called mantis-crabs. Instead of a forceps,consisting of a finger and thumb, theclaw that arms the extremity of the leg is foldeddown, and received into a channel of the shank,Cannon vulgaris. = PaltBinon serralus. ' Pandarus,CRUSTACEAN CONDYLOPES. 39and kept from dislocation by a tooth, or spine, atthe base: this structure may be seen in theshrimp.There is another circumstance, distinguishingthe decayed and stomapod Crustaceans, that ispeculiar to them, their eyes are placed uponjointed footsteps, so that when they want to expireand examine what passes around themthey can immediately erect these organs, and sogreatly enlarge their sphere of vision, but whenthey have retired to their retreats in the cavitiesof the rocks, or to burrows that they haveformed, they can place them in repose,, in acavity provided for them by their Creator, in thehead.Any person, who casts an eye over thesecreatures, will be struck by repeated analogicalforms, representing some terrestrial animals ofthe same Sub-kingdom. Thus a large number ofthose distinguished by the shortness of theirtails, the crabs present, both in their retrogressiveand lateral motions and general aspect, anastonishing resemblance to many Arachnidans ;sway imitating spiders, and others phalanges ;^and, amongst the long-tailed tribe the lobsters,one' very accurately represents a scorpion, andanother a mantisAcropolis Phalangium. ^ Tkalassina Scorpions.^ Squilla Mantis.40 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.We have seen the same tendency in the to approach or imitate terrestrial forms,as if the marine and aquatic animals wereanxious to quit their fluid medium, and to becomeinhabitants of the dry land. The animalliving on shore and in the woods at St. Vincent,taken for a MoUuscan by Mr. Buildings appearsalmost like a creature that had succeeded insuch an attempt.All these resemblances and approximationsshow, that the great Creator embraced at oneview all the forms to which he intended to givebeing, and created no individual without furnishingit with organs which give it some relationto others; or so moulding its outwardform, as to cause it to represent some others towhich it is clear it is not brought near by anycharacters, common to both, that indicate affinity.What can more evidently and stronglymanifest design and that of a mind comprehendingsimultaneously the whole world of createdbeings, than thus to concatenate all link tolink and wheel within wheel, through all theirintricate revolutions and ramifications connectingand connected, and all the while reflectingothers of ia higher or a lower grade with mimicfeatures ? this shows the hand, the art, the wisdom,the power, and the goodness of that unsVol. I. p. 347.

Of these,none are more remarkable than what have beendenominated land-crabs from their usually livingon shore, and making for the sea only at certainseasons* Of the most noted species of these Ihave already given a full account,* but I shallhere notice some others, having the same habits,that will interest the reader. Aristotle, long ago,1 Brachyuri, • Macrouru** Orchestra Uttered. * Vol. I. p. 124.CRUSTACEAN CONDYLOPfiS. 43noticed a crab of this description, found inPhoenicia, under the name of the Hwneman^which he says runs so fast that it is not easy toOvertake it.* Olivier found this account trueof those he saw on the coast of Syria ; and Bosobserved a species' in Carolina, which he hadsome trouble to overtake on horseback and shootwith a pistol. These horsemen crabs are foundonly in warm climates, where they inhabit sandyspots near the shore, or the mouths of rivers.They make burrows in the sand, to which theyretreat when alarmed, and in which they passthe nit.Another kind of land*crab^ is distinguishedby the extraordinary disproportion of its claws ;one of them, sometimes the left and sometimesthe right, being enormously large, while theother is very small, and often concealed, so thatthe animal appears single-handed. This formation,however, is not without its use, for, whenretired into its burrow, it employs this largeclaw to stop up the mouth of it, which secures it£rom intrusion, and this organ is in readiness toseize such animals as form its food and comewithin its reach. They have the habit of holdingup the great one, as if they were beckoningsome one; but this doubtless is an attitude ofIxxevc. Gr. * Hist, Anim, 1. iv. c. 2.^ Ocypode Hippeus^ probably Cancer Cursor, L.'* Gekisimus vocans.44 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.defence These crabs live in moist places, nearthe shore* They attack, in crowds, any carrion,and dispute the possession of it with the vultures; they do not willingly enter the water,except when they lay and hatch their eggs, andit is conjectured that their yoiing are for sometimeentirely aquatic. One kind of them,^ whichforms numerous burrows, remaining in themduring three or four months in the winter,usually stops them up, so that the animals areobliged to reopen them when the warmth of thevernal sun bids them come forth again fromtheir winter quarters. They are devoured bynumerous animals, — otters, bears, birds, tortoises,and other reptiles, all prey upon them,but their multiplication is so excessive, thatthere seems no sensible diminution of theirnumbers.The next tribe of Decapods are the long-tailedones, which do not fold their abdomenunder their body. This part is usually furnishedat the extremity with several plates, which theanimal expands so as to form a fan of five or sixleaves ; they are easily seen in the commonlobster ;* like the tail of birds, they are useful tothe animal in its passage through an elementthat requires to be moved by organs of a firmerG.

The lateral ones inthe species just named, having a kind of articulation,so that they can be partially depressed,and push against the plane they are movingupon ; they do not, like the crabs, quit thewater, and are some of them, as the cray-fishesfresh-water animals.I shall begin with a tribe which, in somedegree, connects the crab with the lobster, theseare what are denominated Hermit-crabs whoseabdomen being naked, and unprotected by anyhard crust, their Creator has given them aninstinct, which teaches them to compensate thisseeming defect, by getting possession of someunivalve shell, suited to their size, which becomestheir habitation, and which they carry aboutwith them as if they were its proper inhabitants.These crabs are particularly formed for thehabit that distinguishes them. Their naked tailhas a tendency to a spiral convolution, fittingthem to inhabit spiral shells, which they usuallyselect for their mansion, though, from recentobservations, it has been found that any univalvewill answer their purpose. Their tail is terminatedby an apparatus of moveable and hardpieces which appear intended to enable theanimal to fix itself more firmly in the spire ofA$tacu$ fluviatHis, * PaguruSy Plate X. Fig. 2.s Ihld. 2. a, a, a.46 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS,the shell. Usually the right hand claw, whichis disengaged from the shell » is double the sizeof the other which is not, and is that which ismost employed ; but in narrow-mouthed shellssuch as the volute, in which Freycinet foundones both claws are disengaged, and are of equalsize. The reason of this formation is evident.The fourth and fifth pairs of legs * are muchsmaller and shorter, than the anterior ones, theyhave, below the claw, a piece resembling arasp, which appears formed to assist them inmoving in the shell, whether they wish to moveoutwards or inwards, and, on one side, they havea series of egg-bearing appendices.' This wholestructure proves that they are formed with thisparticular view of inhabiting the shells of a verydifferent tribe of animals. Some of these hermit-crabs,for there are several species of them, maybecalled terrestrial while others are aquatic.In some of the Indian isles, the shores are coveredwith them. When the heat is most intense,they seek the shelter of the shrubs, and whenthe freshness of the evening breathes, they runabout by thousands, rolling along their shells inthe most grotesque manner, jostling each other,stumbling, and producing a noise by the shockof their encounters, which announces their ap'Pagurus clibanarim. See Plate X. Fig. 2.2 Ibid. bb,c c. 3 /^i^. d, d, d, drCRUSTACEAN CONDYlX)PE8. 47proach before they appear. When they perceiveany danger, they hastily conceal themselves inany ready made holes they meet with, or underthe roots, or in the trunks of decayed trees, seldommaking for the sea, how near soever they maybe.At Guam, a very large species frequentsforests more than a mile from the sea ; and inJamaica, another species, called there the soldier,'has been found in great quantities <m elevatedground, more than four leagues from it.The common species* is aquatic, and usuallyinhabits the whelk ; it is stated annually to leaveits shell, at the time of its moult, and after thisgreat crisis is over, to seek another suited to itsincreased magnitude. Aristotle, Belon, andothers affirm that these animals quit their shellto seek their prey, and that when dangerthreatens them, they retreat to it backwards,hot observations have not been made by modemauthors which confirm this statement. Theirsexual intercourse, however, could not take placewithout their first leaving their mansion.Why our, so called, hermits are gifted withthis singular instinct, is not easy to conjecture.Many other creatures make use of houses thatthey had no hand in erecting, as the bees, thecuckoo, and sometimes the bear, &c. ; but I donot recollect any that, as it were, clothe themselvesPagurus Diogenes, ^ P, Bemhardus,48 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.with the cast garments of other animals. Providence,besides the defence of their otherwiseunprotected bodies, has no doubt some object ofimportance in view in ^ving them this instinct.Perhaps they may accelerate the decompositionof the shells they inhabit, and cause them soonerto give way to the action of the atmosphere ; andas all exuviae may be termed nuisances and deformities,giving to these deserted mansions anappearance of renewed life and locomotion, removesthem in some sort from the catalogue ofblemishes. By this physical hypocrisy, of assumingthe aspect of a different animal, whichis known as not having powerful means of destruction,these creatures may deceive the unwary,and make them their prey, which if theywore the livery of their own tribe, would be ontheir guard and escape them.Next to the Hermit-crabs, or rather Hermit-lobsterscomes a very interesting genus, which mightbe denominated Tree-lobsters from the singularcircumstance of their quitting the sea, like theClimbing-perch,' and in the night ascending thecocoa-nut, and other palm-trees, for the sake oftheir fruit. The species which manifests this remarkableinstinct is gigantic, and must exhibit astriking spectacle when engaged in ascending thestem of a cocoa-tree; but Mr. Cummings Biryus Latro, Plate X. Fio. K * Vol I. p. 123.CRUSTACEAN CONDYLOPES. deservedits proceedings in the Polynesian Islands,where he saw it ascending the palm-treesand devouring their fruit. I have, in a formerchapters stated that the Climbing perch ascendsthe fan-palm in pursuit of certain Crustaceans,perhaps related to the Births, which frequent it.Freycinet observed these crabs, in the MarianIslands, and says that their claws have wonderfulstrength, for when the animal has seized astick, an infant may be suspended from them.They are very fond of the fruit of the cocoa-palm,and may be fed with it for months withoutsuffering from want of water. Whether, like theland-crab, they have a reservoir capable ofcontaining a sufficient quantity of that fluid tokeep the gills moist, has not been ascertained :probably they have.Amongst the larger species of the long-tailedSection, there is one of a most ferocious aspect,having its head, the base of its long antennae,and its thorax, beset with sharp spines. This iscalled in the London market the Thorny lobster ^^and is stated sometimes to be nearly a yard inlength : it is also called the Cray-fish and bythe French, who esteem it highly, the Langouste:it is, however, far inferior to the common lobster,from which it is distinguished by having nopincers, its legs terminating in a strong simple» Vol. 1. p. 126.- Palinurus vulgaris, Leach. Malacostr. Podophth. t. xxx.VOL. II. E50 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.claw, set with bunches of bristles, a circumstanceindicating a different mode of taking itsprey. From the amplitude of their fan-like tail,and from their natatory plates, these lobstersseem formed for rapid motion in the water*The next species that I shall mention is ofmuch more importance to us, and has been celebratedby epicures from ancient times. Insteadof unarmed hands and legs, the Lobsters asevery one knows, has the former armed, oftenwith an enormous pair of claws, which must beof vast power, and, besides, the two antmor pairsof their legs are furnished with small pincers. Itis observable that the moveable finger of the clawof the hands is on their inner side, while, in thesetwo pairs of legs, that on the outside is moveable.Aristotle's Carabus is generally referredto the thorny lobster; but in one place he expresslymentions its using its pincers to catchand carry its food to its mouth, which could notapply to that animal, though it agrees wellwith the common lobster ; yet in another placeunder the same name, he appears to mess theothers It is not known exactly to what usethese smaller pincers are applied; it must beobserved, however, that if the legs. are regardedas naturally pointing towards the head, as inDr. Leach's figure of Nephrops, the moveableAstacus Grammars,« GtJ Kapafioi, Hist. Anim, 1. viii. c. 2. » Ibid, 1. ii. c. 2.CRUSTACEAN CONDYLOPES. 51thumb in all is on the same side. The antennaein this genus are about the length of the body.The pincers of the hand are very powerful andtubercular ; they are used by these animals bothto seize their prey and for self defence and theycontain very powerful muscles. When in thewater the lobster seizes anything presented to it,and hold it so strongly that it is impossible toextricate it without breaking the claw.All Crustaceans cast their crust annually. Atfirst it seems wonderful how this can be accomplished.With insects, in whom it takes placeonly in the larves, and whose form and substanceare usually adapted to it, a longitudinalfissure of the skin of a soft caterpillar, or grub,when the animal grows too big for it, we can conceiveto be no difficult task : but with animalscovered with a hard crust, and in whom notonly the covering of the head, trunk, and abdomenis to be cast, but also that of the legs andother organs, it seems an operation infinitelymore arduous. But He who gave them thisdefence, instincts them also how to rid themselvesof it when it grows too strait for them,and has moulded their structure accordingly.These animals are not, like most insects, limitedto an existence, terminated within theperiod of one revolution of the earth round thesun, but sometimes witness several ; and someare said even to live twenty years, and keep52 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.growing during the greater part of their li£e«But this would be impossible, since it is incapableof extension, unless they could give roomfor the expansion of their body, by occasionallyrejecting the case which incloses it.At a certain time of the year, about the endof the spring, when food is plentiful, they beginto feel themselves ill at ease: they then probablyseek the clefts of the rocks, and otherclose places, in which they can undergo, in concealmentand security, a change which exposesthem, in a defenceless state, to danger.But we should have known nothing of themanner in which this great work is effected,had not the illustrious French naturalist, Reaumur,adopted methods which enabled him toascertain their mode of proceeding. In thespring, in boxes pierced with holes, which heplaced both in the river, and in an apartment,he put the fresh-water cray-fish,* of the samegenus with the lobster. He observed that whenone of these was about to cast its crust, it rubbedits feet one against the other, and gave itselfviolent contortions. After these preparatorymovements, it swelled out its body more thanusual, and the first segment of its abdomenappeared more than commonly distant from thethorax. The membrane that united them nowburst, and its new body appeared. After rest-attacksfluviatilis..CRUSTACEAN CONDYLOPES. 53iDg for some time, it recommenced agitatingits legs and other parts, swelling to the utmostthe parts covered by the thorax, which wasthus elevated and separated from the base ofthe l^s ; the membrane which united it to theunderside of the body burst asunder, and it onlyremained attached towards the mouth. In a fewminutes, from this time, the animal was entirelystripped except the legs. First the margin ofthe thorax was seen to separate from the firstpair of legs ; at that instant, drawing back itshead, after reiterated efforts, it disengaged itseyes from their cases, and all the other organsof the anterior part of the head ; it next encasedone of its fore legs, or all or part of the legs ofone side, which operation is so difficult thatyoung ones sometimes die under it. When thel^s are disengaged, the animal casts off itsthorax, extends its tail briskly, and pushes offits covering and that of its parts. After thislast action, which requires the utmost exertionof its remaining vigour, it sinks into a stateof great weakness. Its limbs are so soft thatthey bend like a piece of wet paper; but ifthe back is felt, its flesh appears unexpectedlyfirm, a circumstance arising, perhaps, from theconvulsive state of the muscles. When thethorax is once disengaged, and the animal hasbegun to extricate its legs, nothing can stop itsprogress. Reaumur often took them out of the54 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.water with the intention of preserving them halfencased, but they finished, in spite of him, theirmoult in his hands. Upon examining theexuviae of these animals, we find no externalpart wanting ; every hair is a case which coversanother hair. The lower articulations of thelegs are divided longitudinally at a suture whichseparates during the operation, but which is notvisible in the living animal.When we consider this apparently arduousand complex operation, we see the most evidentproofs of design, and that the Creatorhas so put together the different parts of theanimal's structure, that there is no occasion todivide the crust itself in <n*der to liberate it.Instead of a solid tube, he has inclosed The legin joints that are furnished vrith the means ofdividing longitudinally, upon sufficient expansionof the included limb, and so opening a wayfor its liberation. In thief whole body all thesegments and parts - are so united by a membranewhich can yield to the expansive efibrts ofthe animal, that the entire liberation of it fromthe armour that encases it, is accomplished withinfinitely more ease than we should expect, evenafter a careful investigation of it. Besidesmembranous ligaments, so arranged by the Wisdomof the Creator as to yield to the efibrts ofthese creatures to liberate themselves from theirtoo strait garment, he has also furnished them.CRUSTACEAN CONDYLOPES. 55as Reaumur remarks, with a slimy secretion,which moistens the interval between the old andnew shell, and facilitates their separation.The time requisite for hardening the newlyacquired crust, according to its previous state, isfrom one to three days. Those animals that areready to moult have always two stony substancescalled crafts-eyes, placed in the stomach, which,from the experiments of Reaumur and others,appear destined to furnish the matter, or aportion of it, of which the shell is formed, for ifthe animal is opened the day after its moult,when the shell is only half hardened, these substancesare found only half diminished, and ifopened later they are proportionably smaller.Thus has Creative Wisdom provided means forthe prompt consolidation of the crust of thesecreatures, so that it is soon rescued from thedangers to which, in its naked state, it is exposed.Reaumur measured several cray-fish, before, andafter their moult, and found that their augmentationamounted to about one-fifth, this amountprobably decreases as they approach nearer totheir adult state. From a chemical analysis ofthe crust of the lobster it has been ascertainedthat it consists of gelatine united to calcareousearth ; it differs from the shells of MoUuscans inhaving a much greater proportion of gelatine,whereas in the latter the calcareous earth greatlypredominates.56 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.It is asserted that hirds^ aad other animals intropical countries, have two mounts within theyear, after the two rainy seasons are passed, andtwo broods ; whether this is the case with Crustaceanshas not been ascertained. Most otherCondylopes do not survive the laying of theireggs, but the Crustaceans are evidently exemptedfrom this law, and emulate the higher animalsin the duration of their existence.It may be observed that the moult of Crustaceansdiffers in one respect from that of birds,which only change their feathers, and that ofquadrupeds who only change their fur, sincethey disengage themselves from their wholeexternal skin with all its appendages, whether offur, or any other substance. Their moult resemblesrather that of trees, whose outer skin,under the form of bark, peels off* annually, andis succeeded by another formed under it, as isparticularly evident in the birch, plane, &c.It is to the researches of the same learned, andpatient, and penetrating experimenter and naturalistthat we are indebted for what knowledgewe possess of the means employed by nature forthe reproduction of the mutilated organs ofCrustaceans. Having cut off* the legs of somecrabs and lobsters, and placed them in coveredboats, communicating with the water, and destinedto keep fishes or Crustaceans alive, at theend of some months, he saw that the mutilatedCRUSTACEAN CONDYLOP£S. 57legs bad been replaced by new onies» perfectlyresembling the old, and almost as large. Thetime necessary for this Reproduction was notfixed, but depended upon the warmth of theseason, and the supply of food furnished to theanimal, and likewise upon the part in which themutilation took place. The point of union ofthe second and third joints, is the part of theleg where a fracture is most easily made, and thereproduction is most rapid. At this point thereare many sutures which appear distinct fromarticulations ; it is in these sutures, particularlythe intermediate one, that the separation usuallyoccurs, and many Crustaceans, if they arewounded in some other part of their leg, cast theremainder off at this suture to facilitate thereparation of their loss. So much only is reproducedin each leg as is necessary to render itagain complete.When a leg is mutilated in the summer, ifexamined a day or two after the experiment,the first circumstance observable is a kind ofcovering membrane of a reddish hue ; in five orsix days more this membrane becomes convex ;next it is protruded into a conical shape, andkeeps gradually lengthening as the germinatingleg is developed ; at last the membrane is rupturedand the leg appears, at first soft, but in afew days it becomes as hard as the old one ; itnow wants only size and length, and these it58 FUNCTIONS AMD INS-ITNGTS.acquires in time ; for at every moult it augmentsin a more rapid proportion than the legs thathave their proper size. The antennas, maxillae,&c., are reproduced in the same manner, but ifthe tail is mutilated, it is never reproduced, andthe animal dies. When attacked. Crustaceans,as well as some of their analogies, the grasshoppers,often cast their l^s as it were voluntarily.When we reflect on this history, we cannothelp admiring and adoring the goodness of theCreator, and his care over the creatures he hasmade, in giving to these animals, which, bothfrom the multiplicity and exposure of their legs,and other organs, and their numerous enemies,are particularly liable to mutilations, a powerthat enables them, in a. short period, to pursuethe course directed by instinct, with undiminishedor little diminished powers.The Stomapodsy or mouth-legged Crustaceans,so named because the maxillary legs do notdiffer materially from the thoracic ones, formthe second Order of the Class, and the speciesbelonging to it, on account of their generalresemblance to the orthopterous tribe formingLinn's genus Mantis are called Sea-Maniises.One of them,^ in its anterior legs, accuratelySqtiUla Mantis,CRUSTACEAN CONDVLOPES. 59represents that genus. But the most remarkableanimals belonging to the Order are the Phyllisof Dr. Leach, which in some respects areanalogies of the Spectres not having the rapturousfiofre leg of. the.Squillse, but their thorax,which consists of two scents, the first verymuch dilated, approaches nearer to that of Mantisstrumaria.^. It has been taken in several tropicalseas, and when living, it is said^to be as transparentas crystal, except its eyes, which aredLy-blue.The subsequent Orders of the Crustaceanscalled by. the general name of Malacostracans^are distinguished from the preceding by havingsessile eyes, imbedded in the substance of thebead, and though they contain many singularcreatures, we know little of their habits andhistory.Many of the. animals belonging to Latreille'sLiemodipodsj or throat-footed Crustaceans, whichbegin the sessile-eyed tribes, have very slenderbodies, and their legs are separated by a considerableinterval, like those of geometric larvesor lovers amongst insects, whose motions theyalso imitate. One remarkable creature is includedin this Order, which is parasitic upon thewhales and by its hooked claws is enabled toPlate X. Fig. 3. P, bremcorne ?« Plasma. ^ Stoll. Spectre. t. xl./. 42.^ Camus Cet.60 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.maintain its station amidst the fluctuations ofthe waves. This animal, like the king-crab, hasboth compound and simple eyes.Next to these succeed the Order oiAmphipods,including a number of genera, consisting usuallyof minute animals ; many of them, like the grasshoppers,and several other sects, are giftedby their Maker with the faculty of leaping.When one meets with a heap of sea-weeds uponthe beach, recently left by the tide, if we turn itover we shall often see under it myriads of littleanimals belonging to this Order, jumping aboutin all directions, which are thus enabled, eitherto find shelter under another mass of moist seaweed,or perhaps to reach their native waves insafety. Whether these Crustaceans, like theiranalogues on shore, feed on vegetable substances,has not been ascertained; they are generallyfound as above stated; and there may be Herbivorousspecies amongst the Crustaceans, aswell as in almost every other class of animals.The last Crustacean Order is called by La-trifle,Isopodsy from their legs being usually ofthe same length ; though a large proportion ofthese are aquatic animals, yet the Order terminatesin those that are ten-trial. Several of theformer are furnished with one or more pair ofdidactyle legs, but the terrestrial ones neverhave these prehensory organs.Amongst the Crustaceans, Latreille has in-CRUSTACEAN CONDYLOPES. 61eluded the Tributes, a remarkable tribe ofanimals, at present found only in a fossil state,and like the britons, certain wood-lice and thearmadillo rolling themselves up in a ball.They may form part of a branch connecting theCrustaceans and MoUuscans, but I leave thediscussion of this point to abler hands.Thus have we at length arrived at animals,the majority of which are terrestrial at least intheir perfect state, for many terrestrial Condy-lopes have aquatic larves and pupes, but few, ornone, I believe, inhabit salt water, except perhapssome species of bugs.^The great Crustacean host, of which probablywe do not know half the species, is certainly amost valuable gift to mankind, as well as to thevarious inhabitants or frequenters of the waters,especially of the ocean, varying as they do insize, from the great thorny lobster to the minutetribes of Entomostracans ; they probably becomethe prey of many sea animals, besides the Cephalopods,which are stated to make such havocamong them When we further consider theirpowers of infinite multiplication, we see thathowever great the consumption of them, thereappears no diminution of their numbers, so that(Mie kind of animals, by the will of Him whoArmadillo vulgaris. • Dasypus.Sala Zo$tar<3P, F. &c. * See above, Vol. I. p. 314.02 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.created all things, and who gave a law to eachspecies, which regulated their numbers, and themomentum of their action, doing or suffering, ismade to compensate for another, and the law ofpreservation to act as an equipoise to the lawof destruction.When we look, however, at these animals, especiallythe larger kinds, and survey their offensiveorgans and weapons, and the coat of mailthat defends them, we feel convinced that theyalso are employed to keep down the numbers ofother inhabitants of the ocean, more especiallyas the great body of them are evidently predaceous: and this, on such a survey, seems toustheir ordinary function. God numbers andweighs them both with those they destroy andthose that destroy them ; his bridle is in theirmouth, and they go as far as he permit them :and when he gives the word — Peace, be still — themutual conflict relaxes, or, in some parts, is intermitted,till the general welfare calls for its revival.It may be observed with r^ard to this constantscene of destruction, this never universallyintermitted war of one part of the Creation uponanother, that the sacrifice of a part maintainsthe health and life of the whole ; the great doctrineof vicarious suffering forms an article ofphysical science ; and ; we discover, standingeven upon this basis, that the sufferings anddeath of one being may be, in the DivineBf Tripod CONDYLOPES. 63counts, and consistently with what we know ofthe general operations of Providence, the causeand instrument of the spiritual life and final salvationof infinite hosts of others. Thus does theanimal kingdom, in some sort, preach the Gospel.OF Christ.Chapter XVI.Functions and Instincts. Myriad Condyhpes.There are two Classes of Condylopes, extremelydissimilar in their external form and the numberof their legs, and yet in some respects related toeach other, at each of which we may be sakenow to have arrived ; both are almost exclusivelyterrestrial, and both remarkable fear theirferocious aspect ; the one the analogue of thecrab and the other apparently related to theIsopod Crustaceans, the priscus and armadillo*It will be easily seen that I am speaking of theArachnidans and Myriapods.Regarding, therefore, the long-tailed DecapodCrustaceans as leading, by the Order of Isopodswhich we last considered, towards the Myriapods,and the short-tailed ones or crabs, as tendingtowards the Arachnidans. I shall give a briefaccount of the former of these Classes in the presentchapter; and I am the more induced to64 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.assign them precedency because of their evidentconnection with certain Annelidansy which indeedAristotle, and other ancient Naturalists, thoughtwas so close, that they considered them as belongingto the same genus and it is worthy ofremark that, in the Class just named, the representatives,if they may be so called, of theMyriapods, are, like them, divided into twotribes, one with a cylindrical and the other withB,Jlat body.*The Myriapods exhibit the following generalcharacters.Animal undergoing a metamorphosis by acquiringin its progress from the egg to the adultstate several additional segments and legs. Bodywithout wings, divided into numerous pestiferoussegments, with no distinction of trunk and abdomen.Head with a pair of antennae ; twocompound eyes ; a pair of mandibles ; under-lipconnate with the maxillae.The class naturally divides itself into twoOrders, distinguished both by their form andhabits.1 .

Some species*emit, through pores, that have been mistakenfor spiracles, a strong and rather unpleasantodour.The penetrate family, of which only a sincespecies is known," is remarkable for several pencilsor tufts of long and short scales, which distinguishthe sides of the body. These are foundprincipally under the bark of trees.The myriads belonging to this order DeGeer describes as very harmless animals. Theyappear to feed upon decaying vegetable oranimal matter. The author just named thinksthat the common Jules* or Gaily worm, feedsupon earth ; one that he kept devoured a considerableportion of the pope of a fly ; otherspecies are stated to eat strawberries and endive; and Frisch fed one, that he kept a legtime, upon sugar.2. The Chilopodans or Centipedes, which constitutethe second order, Latreille divides intotwo families, which he denominates Imequipedesand Equipages. The Inaquipedesy so called be-julius,&c. ' J.fiBtidisdm^u.• Polyxena laurus, ♦ /. terrestrial,MYRIAPOD CONDYLOPES. 67cause the «x last pairs of legs are suddenlylonger than the rest, belong, as at presentknown, to a since genus which being lessdepressed than the other Centipedes, seems toconnect the two Orders. They are not found inEngland, but in France they are stated to frequenthouses and outbuildings, where they concealthemselves during the day, between thebeams and joists, and sometimes under stones ;but when night comes they may be seen runningupon the walls, with great velocity coursingtheir prey, which consists of insects, woodlice,and other minute creatures ; these they puncturewith their oral fangs, and the venom they instillacts very quickly, thus enabling them easily tosecure their victim.The JEquipedesy so called because all their legs,except the last pair, are nearly equal in length,are sub-divided into several genera, the mostremarkable of which is distinguished by theancient name of Scolopendra. Some species ofthis genus grow to an enormous size ; a specimenof the giant centipede in the British Museumis more than a foot long. The arms of the animalsof the present Order are more tremendousthan those of the Millipedes, for their secondpair of legs terminates in a strong claw,' whichGermania. Ulig. Leach. ScuHgera, Lam. Late.■ Sc. Oigas. * Introdd. to Ent. t. vii./. 13. a.68 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.is pierced at the apex for the emission of poison ;in this family the first or hip-joints of these legsare united and dilated so as to form a lips Inwarm climates, the centipedes are said to be veryvenomous.As the anguiform Chilognathans represent theliving and moving serpent, so the family I amnow considering, the equipage ChilopodanSy mayberegarded as representing the skeleton of adead one. The head, with its poison-fangs, thedepressed body, formed of segments representingvertebral joints, and the legs curving inwards,and resembling ribs, all concur to excite theabove idea in the mind of the beholder.Like the last family, these also frequent closeplaces, and sometimes creep into beds; theydevour insects, and similar small animals, whichLatreille found the puncture of their envenomedfangs arrested, and killed instantaneously; andit is sometimes attended with serious inconveniencesto man himself. One species,' in someparts of the West Indies, goes by the name ofthe Mischievous ; * and the pain caused by thebite of the Giant Centipede, though it is nevermortal, is greater than that produced by thesting of the scorpion.Some centipedes emit a phosphoric light ; ofthis description is one distinguished by the nameIntrodd. to Ent. PL vii. /. l\. deb.Scolopendra marshals, ' Mal/aisante,MYBIAPOD CONDYLOPE8. 69of the pliosphofic^^ which is stated by Linn tohave fallen from the air upon Captain Iceberg'svessel in the Indian Ocean, a hundred milesfrom land. But the light*giying centipede bestknown is the electnc,^ which is remarkable foremitting a vivid phosphoric light in the dark ;this is produced by a viscid secretion, which, asI have observed, when adhering to the fingers,gives light independently of the animal. Thisspecies also frequents beds. Its object in thismay, perhaps, be to search for bugs and otherinsects that annoy our species during repose.The function which the Creator has devolvedupon the Myriapods of the first Order, seems tobe that of removing putrescent vegetable andanimal matter from the spots that they frequent ;and that of the second to keep within due limitsthe minor inhabitants, especially the insect, ofthe dark places of the earth. Viewed in thislight, however disgusting they may seem to usin their general aspect, we may regard them asbeneficial, and as contributing their efibrts tomaintain in order and beauty the globe we inhabit.It is worthy of remark that the great HebrewLegislator, amongst the unclean animals whichit was unlawful for the Israelites to eat or toS. phosphorus, • Theophilus eUctricus,70 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.touch, enumerates those which multiply feetIn the common version it is translated, Hathmore feet ; but the marginal reading is nearest tothe Hebrew,* and seems to allude to a circumstanceupon which I shall hereafter enlarge,namely, that these animals increase the numberof their legs with their growth. As a subjectintimately connected with Zoology in general,and leading to a very profitable study of theanimal kingdom in a moral point of view, it willnot be foreign to the object of the present treatiseif I add here a few remarks upon the distinctionof animals into clean and unclean, observable iamany parts of Holy Writ. This distinction wasoriginally to indicate those which might or mightnot be offered up in sacrifice, and, afterwards,when animal food was permitted, to signify tothe Jews those that might and those that mightnot be eaten. When Noah was commanded,Of evei^ clean beast thou shalt take to thee bjisevens the male and his female; and of beasts thatare not clean, by two the male and his female^-^itis evident that the distinction was familiar to thePatriarch. The unclean animals, with respect totheir habits' and food, belonged to two greatclasses, namely Zoophagous animals, or thosewhich attack and devour living animals; andNecrophagous animals, br those which devour• Levity, xi. 42. - D>^:n nail * "Genes, vii. 2.MYRIAPOD CONDYLOPES. 71dead ones, or any other putrescent substances.Of the first description are the caniiM ^ and finestribes amongst quadrupeds; the eagles andhawks ^ amongst birds; the crocodiles and serpentsamongst reptiles; the sharks'' and pikes ^amongst fishes; the tiger-beetles and ground-beetlesamongst insects; and to name no more,the centipedes in the class we are treating of.With regard to the necrophagous tribe, I do notrecollect any mammalian that are exclusively ofthat description, for the hytgna^^ and. glutton ^ areferocious, and eagerly pursue their prey, theywill, however, devour any carcases they meet with,and even disinter them when buried; but thevulture amongst the birds will not attack theliving when he can gorge himself with the de(id ;the carrion crow belongs also to this tribe;amongst insects the burying carrion and dissectingbeetles the flesh-fly and many othertwo-winged flies, feed upon putrescent fish ; andnumberless others satiate themselves with allunclean and putrid substances, whether animalor vegetable.

In other passagesof Scripture, unclean animals are employed tosymbolize evil and unclean spirits as well as menasthe serpent, the dragon, or crocodiles thelion,* and the scorpion.'By way of corollary to the present shortchapter, I shall devote a few pages to a veryinteresting subject, intimately connected withthe animals whose history and habits I have justdescribed, and which marks out the plan uponwhich the wisdom, power, and goodness of theActs, X. 10—15. • Ibid. ver. 28. » Revel, xx. 2,I Pet. V. 8. * Luke, x. 19,MYRIAPOD CONDYLOPES. 73Creator have been manifested in animal structures.I allude to what has been named theconversion of organs, by which term is meant,not only in particular instances, multiplying thefunctions of any given organ, as, for instance,when the tail of an animal is employed like aAomf, to take hold of the branch of a true, and80 assist in locomotion, as in the chameleon, andcertain monkeys ; ^ and the tongue is also madeto subserve to prehension, as in the case of thegiraffe; but likewise when the organ is convertedfrom one use to another, as when theanterior leg is taken from locomotion, and givento prehension, as the human hand ; or as whenall the ordinary oi^ans of locomotion in onetribe are in another converted into oral organs,either to assist in mastication, or to dischargethe office of a lip, as in the Crustaceans and centipedes.In the investigation of this curious andinteresting subject, the class of Myriapods affordsan example, if I may so speak, of the gradualconversion of locomotive organs into auxiliaryoral ernes. Something of this kind I have beforestated is discoverable in certain Annelidans,either related to those animals or their analogues.In the Introduction to Entomology it is observed,with respect to the larves of manyHeaped Condylopes, that their progress towardsAteles. « See above, Vol. I. p. 346.74 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.what is called their perfect state, is by lastingtheir spurious legs or prolegs^ and by acquiringorgans oi flight ; whereas in the Myriapods^ thereverse of this takes place ; instead of losing I^and shortening their body, some of them whenfirst hatched, have only six legs, representingthe six legs of Hexapods, and all in their progressto their adult state acquire a large numberof what may be denominated spurious legs, whichsupport many additional segments.As the Chilognathansy in their young state,come nearest to the insect or heaped tribes, Ishall begin by stating the changes they undergo.In the most common species according to DeGeer's description and figure, the animal isdivided into three principal parts, as in Hexapods; first, there is a Iiead with antennae, andthe usual oral organs, though a little aberrant intheir structure ; next, there is a trunks consistingof three segments, each bearing a pair of 1^;and lastly, there is an abdomen divided into fivesegments, without legs.* With regard to their oralorgans, they correspond with those of Hexapods,both in number and kind, for in the mouth,above is a representative of the upper-lip ; beloirthis is a pair of mandibles or upper-jaws ; nextfollows a lower-lip, consisting of three piecesunited together, the two lateral ones analogous» Julius terrestrial. « De Geer, vii. 583. t. xxxvL/. 20,21.MYRIAPOD CONDYLOPES, 75boll to the lower-jaws of Hexapods, and thefirst pair of maxillae of Crustaceans ; and theintermediate one, resolvable into two pieces,representing the lip of the former and the secondpair of maxillae, according to Savigny, of thelatter, from his figures the maxillary and labialfeelers appear to have their representatives ; yetthough he has figured he does not notice themas feelersThe six original or natural legs of the lulusare its first organs of locomotion, which whenthe animal is arrived at its complete developmentsas to number of legs and segments, — aresaid still to maintain their original function,although probably diminished in energy; thetwo first pairs are, however, as it were, appliedto the mouth, the segments that bear them beingvery short. The sciatic joint or hip of the firstpair forms a single piece ; those of the secondare also united and more elevated ; but those ofthe third are distinct : so that in this Order ofthe Myriapods we see the first tendency towardsemploying what in Hexapods wear the form andperform the functions of legs as auxiliaries ofthe mouthy and of the locomotive function beingderived upon organs which have no representAnim. sans Vertebr.

Ibid. p. 44.76 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.native in Hexapods, except in their incipientstate.To proceed next to the Chilopodans — it hasnot yet been ascertained what changes theyundergo in the progress of their growth, save thatthe number of legs and segments increases tillthey have arrived at their full size nor is it knownhow many they have when first hatched, but,from their structure, it seems evident that theanalogues of the two first pair of l^s of theChilognathans, can never be employed in locomotion; and further, that not only is their firstor hip-joint united with its fellow, so as to formakind of auxiliary lip, but the other articulationsare converted into prehensory organs, instead ofa locomotive one, in the first pair armed at theend with a minute forceps, and in the secondwith a fang resembling the tooth of a serpent,having a pore at the extremity for the emissionof poison, connected with an loterium or poisonbag.Here then, in these two Orders of the Myriads,we have a regular conversion of organs:those that in the Millipedes are used for locomotion,in the Centipedes, exchange that functionfor that of prehension, both agreeing in beingauxiliary, at their base, to mastication, but thelatter with a greater momentum.The reason of this change in the functions ofDe Geer, vii. 562.MYRIAPOD CONDYLOPE8, 77these organs we shall readily see when we considerthe habits and food of these respectiveOrders. The Chilognathans deriving in generaltheir nutriment from putrescent substanceswhether animal or vegetable, have no resistanceto overcome, and therefore require not the aid ofadditional prehensory organs to enable them toexecute their offices; while the Chilopodans,having to contend with living animals, must putthem Hors de combat either by killing them, ordeadening their efforts, before they can devourthem. In this last Order we find that thoughthe two first pairs of legs have a new office, thethird pair are still used for locomotion.From the oral organs and their auxiliaries ofthe Myriapods to those of the Crustaceans theinterval is not very wide ; and amongst the latterthe Isopods, especially the terrestrial ones, asmight be expected, approach the nearest tothem. De Geer observes that the commonwood-louse,' which in its adult state has fourteenl^s ; when it first leaves the egg, has only sixpairs and six segments thus doubling thenumber of the Hexapods and Jnlus ; and in thisanimal and its relation, Ligia^ the thoracic legsare all used in locomotion ; but when we examinethe aquatic f especially the marine generaof this Order, as Idotea^ Stenosoma^ &c., we findPriscus Apelles, * vii. 551.78 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.that the first pair of thoracic lege is taken fromthat function, and made auxiliary to the organsof the mouth.Leaving the Isopods, if we go to the Decapods,amongst those with a long tails which from theircylindrical form and other circumstances, arenearer to the Chilognathan Myriapods than tothe Chilopodan, taking the lobster for our type,we find the organs analogous to the six legs ofHexapods, exhibiting a new character : for fr<Mnthe outer side of their basal joint issues an organwhich is peculiar to these legs. The organ Iallude to is called, by M. Savigny, ^ijlagrum orwhip ; and, by M. Latreille, ^JlagelUform palpusor feeler; it usually consists of two parts, anelongated inarticulate base, representing thehandle of the whip ; and an annulated-or jointedpart generally forming an angle with it, representingthe la: the mandibles also havefeelers of the usual structure. The organs abovealluded to, shew that all the representatives ^the legs of Hexapods in the lobster, are convertedto a new function — whether preciselyanalogous to that of feelers is not clear.In the lobster the basal joints of the first pairof maxillary legs are dilated, and the wholeorgan may be regarded as maxillif<H*m ; but inthe second it is palpiform, and in the third itresumes the joints and appearance ci a cms-Macrouri.MYRIAPOD CaNDYLOPES. 79taceoos leg, and is densely ciliated, which seemsto indicate that it is used in swimming.In the common crab amongst the short-tailDecapods,^ the legs in question seem all takenfrom locomotion, and the second pair does notdiffer from those of the lobster; but the last,though consisting of the same number of joints,is very different, the two intermediate jointsbeing dilated, and the two legs together formingas it were a pair of fblding^oors, which closethe month externally, the three last joints resemblingthose of the legs. These animals,therefore, in some sort, the flatness of theirbody and this double auxiliary lip considered,present the same analogy to the Chilopodan Myriapods,that the lobster does to the Chilegna-than. In both we see, by their feeders, there isa further conversion of these organs into instrumentsconnected with the mouth ; so as to bringthem nearer to the nature and use of maxillae orunder jaws, and of a labium or under-lip.It appears from the experiments and observationsof Rathke' that the long-tailed DecapodCrustaceans do not cbafloige abbe form, or increasethe number of locomotive organs, that distinguishthem when they issue from the eggsCancer Poffums, * BraehyuruRecherches sur ie development des Crevices.

The legs,however, of these Crustaceans cannot be regardedas analogues of the l^s of Hexapads, butrather of the acquired legs of the Myriapods.In order to form a clear notion of the object ofProvidence in thus, as it were, taking certainorgans from locomotion, and forming a new setfor that purpose, and multiplying those connectedwith the seizing and mastication of thefood of the animals in which this metamorphosistakes place, it would be necessary to watch theirproceedings in their native element, the water,1 Cancer Minas. L. Mr. Westwood, in a letter receivedsince this went to press, expresses his conviction that Crustaceansdo not undergo any metamorphosis. Besides a variety of otherarguments which he will himself bring forward in due time, nelately met with young specimens of this crab at Conway, in N.Wales, only ^ of an inch in length, which did not differ fromadult ones.MYRIAPOD CONDYLOPES. 81to ascertain the nature of their food, their modeof taking it, and other circumstances connectedwith its conversion into a pulp proper for digestion;but as few can have an opportunity ofdoing this, we can only conjecture that thismultiplicity of organs is rendered necessary bythe circumstances in which they are placed, andthe element they inhabit; for, as we have seen,no such conversion occurs in the terrestrial Crustaceans; probably the denser medium requires amore complex structure and more powerful actionin the instruments connected with the nutrimentof the animal.Having considered these instances of the legsof Hexapods being, as it were, metamorphosedinto organs more especially connected with nutrition,I shall next mention, more briefly, somecases in which the oral organs themselves aremodified to discharge other functions than whatis usually their primary one.To begin with the Arachnidans or spiders.In these the two-jointed mandibles or cheliceres,as Latreille calls them, are not organs of masticationsolely ; for though, from the vast strengthand power of the first joint and its flat internalsurface, we may conjecture that it assists inpressing the juices out of their prey, yet at theextremity of the second is a poison fang, beingfurnished, like the tooth of a viper or centipede,VOL. II. G82 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.with a pore for emitting Venom, which thoughnot easily discovered in the smaller species, isvisible under a lens in the larger; with thesefangs, which communicate with a poison vesicle,the spider dispatches the insects struggling in histoils, which otherwise he could not so easilymaster, and having sucked out their juices castsaway the carcase. The fang, by folding uponthe apex of the basal joint of the organ we areconsidering, which is toothed on each side, andhas a channel to receive it when unemployed,can be formed into a forceps, resembling thatwhich arms the anterior thoracic leg of the shrimp,or that of the mantis, and which is probably, insome circumstances, used for prehension.The subject of poison-fangs affords a strikingexample of the adaptation and modificationof different parts and organs to the dischargeof the same or similar functions, according tothe circumstances in which an animal is placed ;the viper, the centipede, and the spider havetheir sting in their mouthy or in its vicinity;the scorpion and the bee and wasp have it at theother extremity of the body ; while the male ofthe Omithorhynchusy or Duck-bill, and Echidnaor New Holland Porcupine, have it in their kindlegs. Considering the evident affinity betweenthese last animals and the birds their poison-spurseems evidently analogous to the spur thatdistinguishes the males of many gallinaceousNYRIAPOD CONDYLOPES. 83birds; and, reasoning from analogy, we mayconclude that this organ is given to the males ofthe Mfnudremeg a^ a weapon to be ii3ed in theirmutual combats.Whoever examines the underside of a spiderwill find the feelers and the eight legs arrangednearly in a circle, with their first hip-jointsparallel ; with some this joint in the feelers isdilated, but in others it is of the same shape withthe analogous joint of the legs, only a littlelonger. It forms the nrnxUla or under-jaw, andbetween the first pair is the under-lip. Thefunction of the maiciUae is to assist the, so called,mandibles, in pressing out the juices of the fliesand other insects submitted to their action, andthe analogous and parallel joints in the eightlegs add scMine momentum to it.The Palpi or feelers — ^which in some casesemerge from the side of the maxilla, and appeara distinct organ, and in others are merely acontinuation of it— in one sex undergo a singularconversion, and discharge a function connectedwith . reproduction ; and in the other, thefemale, are said sometimes to assist in supportingthe egg pouch, which many of these creaturescarry about with them, and guard with maternalsolicitude.It has been made a question by physiologistswhat the mandibles, and maxillse with theirpalpi, of the Arachnidans really represent;H4 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.whether they are the analogues of organs bearingthe same name in Heaped Condylopes, orof others to be found in the Crustaceans orMyriapods. Latreille, in his latest work, regardsthe pieces immediately following the upper lipas analogues of the same parts in the Crustaceans,namely, a pair of palpigerous mandibles,two pairs of perform maxillae, and twopairs also of maxillary feet, analogous to the fouranterior feet of insects.* Of the above organs,the mandibles and two pairs of maxillae may beregarded as having their prototype in the Hexapods;for the second pair of maxillae of theCrustaceans, in the Chilognathans, is the piecethat represents the labium, or under-lip, of thefirst named animals.Savigny, however, is of opinion that the auxiliarymaxillee^ or, according to Latreijle, maxillaryfeet of the crab, except the first pair, becomethe mandibles and fimxillte of the spider; andthat the thoracic legs of the same animal, withthe same exception, become also its ambulatorylegs :^ thus accounting for the reduction of thenumber of the latter from ten to eighty perhapshe was induced to adopt this opinion, with respectto the oral organs, by considering the mandiblesof the spider as analogous to the poisonsCaurs D'Entomologie, 167.Anim. sans Vertebra. ii. 57, Note a.HYBIAPOD CONDYLOPES. 8dfang which anus the second pair of auxiliaryfeet of the Scolopendra.I feel, however, rather inclined to adopt theopinion of the former learned entomologist, fromthe consideration of an Arachnoid, which seemsevidently to lead towards the Hexapods. Theanimal I allude to is one of ancient fame, ofwhich, once for all, I shall here give the history.delian relates that a certain district of £thiscopia was deserted by its inhabitants in consequenceof the appearance of incredible numbersef scorpions, and of those Phalangians^ whichare denominated Tetragnatha^ or having fourjaws. An event mentioned also by DiodorusStimulus and Strabo Pliny likewise alludes tothis event, but calls the last animal Solpuga^^ aname which, in another places he says was usedby Cicero to designate a venomous kind of ant.The epithet Tetragtmthaj applied by Julian,&c. to the animal which, in conjunction withthe scorpion, expelled the ethiopians, as juststated, from the district they inhabited, seemsclearly to point to the Solpuga of Patricius,for any person, not skilled in natural science,would, when he saw the expanded forceps oftheir mandibles, pronounce that they had four1 Chart. Heraldic. ii. 1. iv. c. Id.< Hist. Nat. 1. viii. c. 29. This name seems derived fromthe Greek y Heliocentris.L. xxix. c. 4.86 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.jaws;^ and the animals of this gaius, in theirgeneral form and aspect, exhibit no small resemblanceto an ant so that it is not wonderfulthat Pliny should regard them as a kind of venomousant. It seems, therefore, almost certainthat the ancient and modem Solpnga are synonymous.Pliny, indeed, mentions a certain kindof spider— one of which he describes as wearingvery ample webs — sunder the name Tetragnathii;but these appear to have no connexion with thePhalanges tetragnatha of ^lian, &c.Olivier was the first modem naturalist whodescribed the animals now before us, to whichhe gave the generic appellation of Galeodes ; butif, as the above circumstances render very probable,they are really synonymous with the ancientSolpuga^ that names revived by Patricius,should be retained.Whether these animals are really as venomousand maleficent as they were said to be of old,and as their terrific aspect may be thought toannounce, seems very doubtful. We learn fromOlivier that the Arabs still regard their Ute asmortal, and that the same opinion obtains inPersia and Egypt ; and Pallas relates severalfacts, which, he says, he witnessed himself, whichappear to prove that, unless timely remedies areapplied, they instill a deadly venom into those1 L. Dufour. AnnaL Gin, des Sc. Nat. iv. t. Xiv. f. 7, a.HYRIAPOD CON DY LOPES. 87they bite. Oil is stated to be the best application.On the other hand, Olivier, who foundthese Arachnidans common in Persia, Mesopotamia,and Arabia, affirms that ever night theyran over him, when in bed, with great velocity,without ever stopping to annoy him ; no onewas bitten by them, nor could he collect a singlewell^attested fact to prove that their bite wasso dangerous: to judge by the strong pincerswith which the mouth is armed, he thought itmight be painful, but he doubts whether it isaccompanied by any infusion of venom. Themandibles have clearly no fang with a poison-poise,like those of the spiders.To return from this digression. I principallymentioned this tribe of animals, because, as waslong ago observed by Walckenaer,^ and the observationwas repeated by L. Dufour,' the head,in them,^ is distinct from the trunk ; and, as wellas Phrynus and ThelyphomiSy it has only sixthoracic l^s: so that, as the latter writer remarks,though its physiognomy and mannersarrange it naturally with the Arachnidans, thesecharacters exclude it from them.' Latreille,indeed, seems to regard the head and trunk ofthis animal as not distinct, but as forming togetherwhat he names a cephalothoraa;^ or head-thorax; yet he admits that the three last pairs1 Tableau des Araneid, 1. ' Ubi supr, 18.3 Ibid. 20.88 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.of legs are attached to as many segments of thetrank,^ which certainly infers the separationabove alluded to.Savigny says, with respect to the feelers ofSolpugUy that they, and the two anterior legs,so closely resemble each other, that they mayeither be called feelers or legs ; but in the speciesdescribed by L. Dufour,^ and another inmy cabinets this is not altogether the case, forthe feelers, though perform, are not terminatedby a claw, but by a membranous vesicle, fromwhich issues, when the animal is irritated, anapparatus probably used as a sucker, and whichgives them a prehensory function; while theorgans that represent the anterior pair of legs ofthe other Arachnidans, at the base of theirmaxillary or sciatic joint, are soldered, as itwere, to the corresponding joint of the feelers,with which they agree in the number and kindof their articulations, except that they do notprotrude a sucker ; neither are they armed witha claw like the other legs, but are probablysimply tentacular or exploratory. There seemsno slight analogy between these united maxillaeand what Savigny denominates the first andsecond pair of maxillae of the mille pedes, alsounited, which appear to me to represent thelower-lip and maxillse of the hexapods, and inCours D'Entomolog. 548. « Oaleodes intrepid.^ Solpuga fatalist.MYRIAPOD CONDYLOPES. 89this case the two pair of feelers that itasae fromthe coxo-msocillee, as they are sometimes called,or sciatic joints in the Solpuga^ may be regardedas representing the labial and maxillary feelersof the hexapods ; the second pair .are also analogous,both in their place and their function, tothe first pair, or tentacular legs of Thelyphonusand Phfynns. In the Solpuga^ the labium, orunder-lip, of the spiders, is represented by abilobed organ, which Savigny calls a sternaltongue.From the consideration of this animal weseem to have obtained the elements, or type, inreference to which the oral, prehensory, andlocomotive organs of the Arachnidans wereformed; that their mandibles, maxillae, andfeelers ; their second maxillae, and the, so called,anterior legs emerging from them, are analogousto the mandibles, labium and labial feelers, andmaxillae and maxillary feelers of the hexapods ;and the remaining three pairs of legs, of theirsix l^s; the sternal tongue, so called by Sayingbecause it is a process of the stimuli, willthus be an organ sui generis unless it may beregarded as, in some sort, the analogue of theprostemum of insects. If this view is correct,we have here various conversions, as of maxillaand palpi into legs; a labium into maxilla; anda prostemum into a labium. In the Pedipalps —with the exception of the scorpions, — e. g. in90 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.Thelyphmms and Pkrynus, especially the latter,the Jirst pair of l^s of Octopods seem to wearthe form, and in some measure to discharge thefunctions of antentuB.In the shepherd-spiders ^ all the legs, in somedegree, imitate antennae, especially in their tarsiwhich sometimes consist of more than^i(y joints,rendering them very flexible, so as to assumeany curve, and fits them, as their long legs dothe crane-Jiy^ to course rapidly over and amongthe herbage and the leaves of shrubs, &c. Whenreposing upon a wall, or the trunk of a tree, thisanimal arranges its legs so as to form a circle asit were of rays around the body, the thigh forminga very obtuse angle with the rest of the leg, andso, though the body is so small, they occupy aconsiderable space; but, if a finger, or anyinsect, &c. touches them, it elevates these anglesinto very acute ones, so as to form a circle ofarcades round the central nucleus or body, underwhich any small creature can pass, but if thisdoes not succeed, it makes its escape with avelocity wonderful for an animal furnished withlegs more than ten times the length of its body.In the scorpion and the hook-crah^ as well asthe shepherd-spider, the mandibles, which areshort, have a moveable joint, and are convertedinto a forceps, like the anterior legs of the crab or^ Pkalangium» ^ Tipula, ^ Chelifery ObisiuiHf &c.MYRIAPOD CONDYLOPES. 91the lobster; their feelers also, which are verylong, terminate in the same way, and form anoiigan by which they can catch their prey ; theformer being armed besides with a long jointedtail, furnished at the end with a sting, whichthey can turn oyer their back, and thus, eitherannoy their assailants, or dispatch any captivewhose resistance they cannot otherwise easilyovercome.To what a variety of uses are analogous organsapplied in the diversified instances here adduced ;and in all these variations from a common type,how apparent are the footsteps of an intelligentFirst Cause, taking into consideration the intendedstation and functions of every animal,and how the structure may be best adapted tothem, not only in general, but in every particularorgan.As far as we can lift up the mystic veil thatcovers the face of nature, by means of observationand experiment, we find that every iota andtittle of an animal's structure, is with a view tosome end important to it; and the AlmightyFabricator of the Universe and its inhabitants,when be formed and moulded, ex pnejacentenuttteriay the creatures of his hand, decreed thatthe sphere of locomotive and sentient beingsshould be drawn together by mutual attraction,and concatenated by possessing parts in common,92 LOCOMOTIVE ANDthough not always devoted to a common use;thus leading us gradually from one form to another,till we arrive at the highest and most distinguishedof the visible creation ; and instructingus by his works, as well as by his word, to cultivatepeace and union, and to seek the good ofthe community to which we belong ; and, as faras our influence goes, of the whole of Hiscreation.Chapter XVII.Motive locomotive and prehensory Organs ofAnimals considered.The remarkable circumstances noticed in thelast chapter with r^ard to the legs of Crustaceansand Myriapods, and their employment inaid of manducation, sheds no small light uponthe subject of locomotive organs in general, andtheir primary fiction ; it will therefore not beout of place, if, in the present chapter, I considerthose organs, as far as they are externals accordingto their several types, as exhibited in theentire sphere of animals ; upon which, indeed,the due accomplishment of their various functions,and the exercise of their several instincts^-^whichin most of the succeeding classes assume a newPrebendary ORGANS. 93and more developed character — mainly dependsThis is a wide fields but one full of interest, andwhich, studied as it deserves, conspicuously illustratesthe higher attributes of the Deity.We are placed in a world full of motion ; of allmotions, none fall more immediately under ournotice than those of the various members of theanimal kingdom ; and the external oi^ns bywhich they are effected, attract every eye bothby their infinite diversity, and the adaptation oftheir individual structure to the occasions andwants of the animal in whom they are found, sothat they may, in the best and safest manner,effect such changes of place as are necessary fortheir purposes.Nutrition may be stated as the primary objectof the motions and locomotions of the membersof the animal kingdom in general.

And, whetherwe descend to the foot of the scale of animals,or moist to its summit, we shall find that their—Daily Bread — sis the principal object that inevery Class sets the members in motion.The motive organs may be divided into twoclasses, those that are employed by an animalin locomotion and those that are used for prehension; but as many of the locomotive organs are94 LOCOMOTIVE ANDalso prehensile, and pKhenaion 10 often in aidof locomotion — as in climbing and burrowing —it will not be easy to consider the motive oiganflseparately with regard to these functions, I shalltherefore consider them generally, according tocertain types or kinds, under which they maybearranged, and which present themselves rayobviously, when, with this view, we survey frombase to summit, or rather from pole to pole,the entire sphere which constitutes the animalkingdom.Generally speaking, in this survey, as well asin the peculiar motions of the various groups ofanimals, we have no trouble in ascertaining whatare the external organs by which the Creator hasenabled and instructed each animal to accomplishthem; but there is one anomalous tribe, or,perhaps, it might be denominated, Stib^king^w^in one Class of which, at least, this is not soobvious. I allude to Ehrenbarg's Tribe of Plantsparticularly his first or polygastricClass in which the organs of their various loco-motions,enumerated in a former part of thiswork,' remain unknown, and some, as those, thathave an oscillatory movement, one might almostsuspect were moved fay ui extent cause. Thelittle Monad, parasitic on die eye* worm of theperches which alternately spins round like a top,1 Phytozoa. « See Vol. I. p. 156.s Ibid. 153. * Diplostamum volens.PRBHEN80BY OBOASS. 95and thei darts forward like an arrow seems asif like a watch, it required to be wound upfaeficMre it could go.Before I confine my observations to thosemotive organs which are local and planted incertainparts of the body of an animal, as legswings, fins, &c«, I shall first mention those motionsin which the whole body is concerned. Ofthis description is the alternate expansion andcontraction of some, as the Sales and Pyrosomesand other Tunicaries ;^ the annular motion propagatedfrom one extremity of the body to theother, as in the earth-worms,' geometric catererpillars, and many other larves ; the undulatingmovements of the flexile bodies of many aquaticanimals, as fishes, particularly the serpentiformones ; and the gliding motion of serpents themselvesover the surface of the earth as well astheir undulations. Many of the animals hereallowed to are provided with subsidiary organs —as the earth-worm with lateral bristles thegeometric larves, with legs at each extremity ofth body; the leach with suckers; which,however, would be of little use without the expansionand contraction of its body ;^ and thefishes with fins : but if we consider the form andVol. I. Appendix, p. 354. « See Vol. I. p. 223, 227.3 Ibid, p 340. * Ibid.^ Ibid. p. 336.96 . LOCOMOTIVE ANDcircumstances of all these animals, ve shall see,in each case, the design and contrivance ofSupreme Wisdom. Without the power of contractionand expansion, by which the Sales,Pyrosomes, &c., alternately attract and repelthe waters which they inhabit, they might indeed,from their absorbent structure, be saturated,but nutrition could not take place. The earthwormagain, a subterranean animal, but whichoccasionally emerges, by the annular motion ofits body can much more easily wind its sinuousway without obstruction when it seeks again itsdark abode under the earth. The denser mediumcompared with air, through which the aquaticanimals pass, renders great flexibility a veryimportant quality, to enable them to overcomethe resistance it opposes to their progress.Having premised these observations on motionsproduced by the action of the whole body, orsuccessively propagated from one extremity tothe other, I shall now proceed to consider thoseexternal oigans, which are its obvious instrumentsin the great majority of animals, beginningwith those that are found in the lowest groups.1. Rotatory Organs. In some species of In-furies, even in Ehrenberg's first Family of hispolygastric Class, the oral aperture is fringedwith a circlet of bristles, but whether the animalby their means creates a vortex in the water, orwhether they are analogous to the tentacles ofPRBHEMSORY ORGANS. 97the polypes, and are employed in collecting itsfood, seems not to have been clearly ascertained.Lower down in this Class, and approaching theRotatories, we find a singular animal,^ withbristles, by their position, simulating legs, which,as was before observed,* revolve with wonderfulrapidity. But it is in the Class of Rotatoriesthat these revolving organs are most conspicuous.They are described as shaped like a tunnel,the tube of which terminates in a deep-seatedpharynx armed with jaws, and the externaldilated orifice fringed with fine hairs or bristles,to which the animal communicates a very rapidrotation, whence they are called wheeUanimals.Some, as the vortices,' the wheel-animals by wayof eminence, appear to have two wheels, otherstrees or eyenfimr : Lamarck is of opinion, fromthe observations of Du Prophet, that what aretaken for two or more wheels, are only one, bentso as to form partial ones;^ but in some theyare certainly distinct organs.* The object of therapid gyration of this wheel or wheels is to1 Discocephalus Rotator, Plate I.

These wheels are merelyforaging organs, for on a surface the locomotionsof these singular animals resemble those of theleech described in another place*'In surveying the organs by which animalsprocure their, food, we are struck by the wonderfuldiversity and multiplicity of means by whichthe same end is attained, and yet, through allthis diversity, a series of approximations may betraced, proving that the same hand directed bythe Wisdom, Power, and Love of one and thesame Infinite Being fabricated the whole host ofcreatures endowed with powers of voluntarymotion. What care does it manifest, and attentionto the welfare of these invisibles, and whatcontrivance, that they should be fitted with anorgan, by means of which, when they areawakened from a state of suspended animation,and from a long fast perhaps of months, or evenyears, by water coming in sufficient contactwith them, they can start up into life, and bythe gyrations of their wheels immediately bento breathe, and to procure a sufficient supply of• See Vol. I. p. 336.PREHENSORY ORGANS. 99food for their sustenance, while they continueanimated.2. Tentacles. Nearly related to these bristle-crownedrotatory appendages of the mouth ofsome animalcules are what are named Tentacles.80 called probably from their being usually exploringorgans. In its most restricted sense,this term is understood to signify organs, appendagesof the mouth, which have no articulationsbut, in a larger sense, the term hasbeen applied also to all jointed organs in itsvicinity, and used for a similar purpose, whichindeed are the precursors of feelers and antennae.The structure, of the first-mentioned,or proper tentacles, and the means by whichthey perform their motions, and fulfil theirfunctions, have been before explained.* It is tothese organs, as well as for their food, that thepolypes are indebted for what constitutes theirprincipal ornament, that resemblance which,though born to blush unseen, even in the depthsof the ocean, their Creator has enabled them toassume, of a plant or shrub in full blossomadorned with crimson or orange-coloured flowers.In the Fixed polypes, the tentacles are theonly motive organs, but in those that can shifttheir quarters as the Hydra they move byfixing each extremity like the leech, probably1 See Savigny Syst. des Annelides, iii. 4.2 See Vol. I. p. 164. ' Ibid. 173.100 LOCOMOTIVE ANDby means of something analogous to suckers.As the former, like their analogues in the vegetablekingdom, are fixed by their base, andconsequently cannot move from place to placein search of food, Divine Goodness has compensatedthis to them, and they obtain all theadvantages of locomotion by the progressivemultiplication of their oscula or mouths, eachsurrounded by a coronet of tentacles, so thatthey have, on all sides, and at all heights, numberlesssets of organs constantly employed incollecting food from the fluid they inhabit ; some,it is stated, by creating a vortex, like the wheelanimals, and the majority, probably, by meansof minute suckers, or some viscid tenacioussecretion. What each individual collects doesnot merely serve for its own nutriment, but alsocontributes something to that of the whole com-munity,^ so that though some may contributemore to the common stock and others less, yetthe deficiency of one is made up by the redundancyof another.The tentacles of the fresh-water polypesforming the locomotive genus Hydra are not, asthose of the fixed marine ones, shaped like thepetals of a blossom, but are long hair-like flexilearms, somewhat resembling the branches of achandelier,* which explore the waters around> See Vol. I. 171.8 Lesser. L.

Inthe Elastic Medusa there are four broad flexiblearms, and round the margin eight narrow tentacles,as they are called, both of which theanimal is stated to employ in seizing its prey, sothat both may be entitled in this view to the denominationof tentacles yet one may be respiratoryorgans and the others merely prehensory.^But the Medusidans vary greatly with regard tothese organs, some having neither arms nor tentaclesothers having tentacles but no arms;^others again arms but no tentacles ;^ and lastly,others both these organsIn the two first sections of the Order of Eclii-moderns, consisting of the Stelleridans andEchiuidanSy the mouth has no coronet of tentacles,but, instead, is armed with five pieces,which, in the latter particularly, assume the formand function oi mandibles ;^ but the Fistulidans» See Vol. I. 165—170. « p. 195.^ Cams.

Inthe Holothuria, besides these, the mouth isarmed with five teeth or mandibles.Tentacles, but not conspicuously, surround themouth of only some of the Tunicaries^ it willtherefore be sufficient merely to mention them,and proceed to certain oceanic animals amongstthe Annelidans whom their Creator has adorned,if I may so speak, with rays of glory, which,when expanded, surround their head, or rathermouth, with a most magnificent coronet. Theanimals I allude to constitute the genus Amphitriteof Lamarck, and the Shells of Savigny ;this coronet, in some species, is formed by numeroustentacles, called, by the authors justnamed, Branching or gills ; but as they are statedto be employed in collecting their food, as wellas in respirations they seem in this respect perfectlyanalogous to the tentacles of the polypes,and wheels of the oratories, which are alsorespiratory organs. The great difference seemsto consist in their being divided into two fanlikeorgans in the Amphitrites, in which thedigitations or tentacles proceed from a commonbase, and which together form the coronet. Insome the digitations, like the sticks of a fan, are^ Lamarck, Anim, sans Vertebr. v. 355.PREHENSORY ORGANS. 103connected by an intervening membrane, thusresembling two expanded fans;^ in others, thispair of organs forms two bunches, set, as it were,with numerous spirally convoluted plumes ;^ in athird each bunch of plumy tentacles is convoluted,but not spirally ;' but the most magnificentspecies of the genus, if indeed it belongs toit,is that figured in the fifth volume of theTransactions of the Linnean Society ^^^ under thename of Tvhularia magnijica. I say, if indeed itbelongs to it, because, if the figure Quoted is correct,which I am not aware there is any reasonto doubt, the gills or tentacles, call them whichwe will, are not, as in the other species, dividedinto two fasciculi or bundles, the rays of whichsit upon a common base ; but form one gloriousand radiant coronet, whose rays are beautifullyannulated with red and white; there appearsindeed to be a double circle or series of theserays, the interior ones shorter than the exterior ;but there is not the least appearance of theirdivision into two bunches, each forming a semicircle.The rays difier little from those of manyof the polypes, except in being more numerousand longer, for the diameter of the circle, whenthe rays are all expanded, is nearly six inches,and it is not stated that the figure is ossified.^ Amphitrite Infundibulum.

Whoever compares the above figureof this expanded animal-blossom with the nectariesof some species of passion-flower, will bestruck by the resemblance they exhibit to eachother and by the analogy that evidently existsbetween them. As prehensory organs, the principalobject of their unusual length and numbersmay probably be their capturing, as in anet, a quantity of rock animals, or animalcules,sufficient for their support, and perhaps theirvery beauty may be a means of attraction andbring them within their vortex.With these splendid animals we bid farewellto those whose oral organs seem analogous tothe blossoms of vegetables, and also to those inwhom the organs of prehension and respirationare united ; or in which the same organs collectfood and also act the part of gills.Though tentacles are not henceforth employedin respiration yet they still exist in several otherclasses of animals as exploratory, prehensory,and locomotive organs. But in none are theymore remarkable, both for their structure anduses, than in the Cephalopods or cuttle-fish. InSee Linn. Trans, ii. t, iii./. a. b.PREHENSORY ORGANS. 105these animals they are used, as we have seen, asanas for prehension, as legs for locomotion, assailsfor skimming the surface of the ocean, asoars for passing through its waves, as a rudderfor steering, and as an anchor to fix themselves.These organs, like the tentacles of the po*13^8, surround the mouth; in some genera, asthe poulpe,^ and sepiole,^ besides eight shorterarms there is a pair of very long ones, whichare usually . denominated tentacles, hy way ofeminence, which the animal probably uses, andfor which purpose a claw arms their extremity,*to lay hold of prey at a distance. The meansby which the tentacles perform the locomotionsof these animals, and enable them to seize theirprey, I shall advert to under another head.But though, in the great body of the Cephalopods,the tentacular organs do not exceed teujwe find, fix)m Mr. Owen's admirable memoir onthe Pearly Nautilus that, in that animal, theyare extremely numerous, and strikingly differentin their structure. The mouth and its appendagesare retractile within the head, whichforms a sheath for them, the orifice of which isanterior. The proper tentacles are of two kinds :1. Brachial ones, finely annulated, emergingfrom thirty-eight three-sided arms, disposed ,« Sepia.» Plate VII. Fig. 3. a. * Ibid, b.Nautilus Amplius,106 LOCOMOTIVE ANDregularly, nineteen on each side, all directedforwards, and converging towards the orifice ofthe oral sheath. 2. Labial ones, similar to theothers in their structure, and emerging from fourbroad flattened processes, arising from the innersurface of the sheath, and more immediatelyembracing the mouth and lip: from each ofthese processes emerge twelve tentacles, rathersmaller than the brachial ones. Besidesthese two descriptions of tentacles, there is apair, one on each side, emerging from two orificesin the inner part of the hood or foot, arrangingwith the arms, and perhaps to be reckonedwith the brachial tentacles, thus makingup the whole number of tentacles of a similarstructure eighty-eight. It is to be observed thatneither the parts that sheath them, nor the tentaclesthemselves, are furnished with any acta*bull or suckersBesides the tentacles, this animal has fouranalogous organs of a different structure, onebefore and one behind each eye, which Mr.Owen likens to antennae, and which are lamellated,or composed of a number of flattened circulardisks, appended to a lateral stem ;* a circumstanceindicating a variation in their functions.From their being retractile, it should seem1 Owen's Memoir, &c. 13, t. i. n. * Ind. 14.PREHENSORY ORGANS. 107that in this animal the tentacles are not in constantuse, as they are in the naked Cephalopods,and that they require protection ; fromtheir finely annulated structure they appear tobe flexible and easily applicable to any surface,but whether they are tentacular or prehensoryorgans, or both, is unknown. In the account ofthe Loligapsisj a species of cuttle-fish, by theable pen of that eminent zoologist Dr. Grant,the part apparently analogous to the labial ten*tacaliferous processes of the Nautilus, is calledthe outer-lips and is stated to send out a muscularband to the base of each arms whichseems to indicate that the arms of the nakedCephalopods are analogous to the labial tentaclesof the animal we are considering. Thelabial processes, with their tentacles, presentsome resemblance to a many-fingered handsand from their situation immediately next themouth may be conjectured to be most concernedeither in the capture or transmission of its food :but whether either set of tentacles is used in itslocomotions, as they are in the naked Cephalopodsand the Argonaut, seems very problematical.As far as its locomotion on a surface is concerned,in its hood, it appears to be furnishedwith an expansile foot, approaching that of theTrans, of ZooL Soc, I. i. 23.» Owen, ubi supr, t, iv./, i », g g.108 LOCOMOTIVE ANDGastropods^^ so that its tentacles seem not necessaryto transport it from place to place on thebed of the ocean; by what means it elevatesitself, as it is known to do, to the surface, andfloats upon the waves, has not been ascertained.In comparing the organs that surround themouth of the Nautilus with those of other Cephalopods,we see that a vast change has takenplace. They are no longer the principal organsof locomotion, that function being transferred toan expansile foot ; their number is increased innearly a tenfold ratio : being deprived of suckers,they seem destitute of any powerful means ofprehension and retention, and so are scarcelyable to overcome the resistance of the largerCrustaceans. As their principal organ of locomotionis one that seems to preclude all idea ofrapid motion in pursuit of their prey, it is mostprobable, as their mandibles are fitted for crushingcrust or shell, that certain MoUuscans, animalswhich must be equally slow in their motions,and can scarcely resist them, are theirdestined food.We may further observe, that, regard beinghad to the organs which surround the mouth, avery wide interval separates the great body ofthe Cephalopods, known in a recent state, fromthe animal now before us; even the Spiinda^which Mr. Owen conjectures may belong to theOwens Memoir y &c. 12, ^ i. n.Prebendary ORGANS. 109same Order, in this respect is formed upon avery different type, precisely that of those This animal, in the above respect, being socompletely insulated, it seems, as if in its meansof entrapping its prey it was formed upon a plannot connected with that of any other MoUuscan,but quite mi generis: probably, were we acquaintedwith the animals belonging to what aredeemed fossil Cephalopods, we should find thehiatus vastly narrowed.In this instance we see clearly that adaptationof means to an end which distinguishes all theworks of the Creator; the striking variationwhich this creature exhibits from the oral apparatusof its Class, is evidently connected with thekind and circumstances of the animals which itis commissioned to keep within their properlimits ; its mandibles, or beak, indeed, resemblethose of the other Cephalopods, indicating thatits prey are covered with solid integuments, requiringgreat force to crush them ; but the otheroral organs, and its snail-like foot, as we see,indicate that they are not of a kind that caneasily escape from their assailants.Two objects seem to have been principally inthe mind of the Almighty planner of the universeof beings : one seems to have been theconcatenation of all subsistence, seriatim and1 Plate IV. Fig. 2.112 LOCOMOTIVE ANDsurrounded by an iris,* which seems to indicatethat the tentacles perform, in some sort, thefunctions of that part of the eye. The upperpair of tentacles in the MoUuscans seem analoguesof the antennae of Condylopes, and thelower pair of their feelers ; and the functions for*which the Creator has formed and fitted bothare probably not very dissimilar. The extremeirritability of the tentacles of snails and slugs isevident to every one who observes their motion :at the approach of a finger they are immediatelyretracted ; they therefore give notice to the animalof the approach of danger, so as to provideagainst it, and when necessary to withdrawitself into its shell : the eyes, from their situationin many of them, supposing them to have a greaterrange and power of vision than they appear tohave, cannot direct them in the choice of theirfood, in these their lower tentacles may have thisoffice. Snails and slugs, we also know, issueforth from their places of concealment when theearth is rendered moist enough, by showers,for them to travel easily over its surface; sothat they must be endued with some degree ofaeroscepsy^ of which probably these delicateorgans are the instruments.Whether the barbs appended to the mouths ofmany fishes, as the barbel, the Siluridans,^ andPlate VI. Fig. 1, a. ' Plate XII. Fig. 1.PREHENSORY ORGANS. 1 13the Fishing-frogs may be regarded as a kind oftentacle cannot be certainly affirmed, but fromtheir proximity to the mouth, it seems most probablethat they exercise some function connectedwith the procuring of its food. Cuvier regardsthem as a kind of actors, and they also presentsome analogy to antennae and palpi.In many of the Annelidans, tentacles of thepresent description are found not only in thevicinity of the mouth, but also upon the pedi-seroussegments of the body, and appear to beequally used in exploring objects.*I shall next consider some tentacular organs,which differ from those we have been consideringin being more or less jointed. These, on thataccount, have been considered as a differentclass of organs, and by many have been denominatedcirri or tendrils, or more properly, bySavigny, tentacular cirri. I have before describedorgans of this kind in my account of theCirripedes^^ by which it appears that they areemployed for the same purposes as the tentaclesof the polypes. Under this head also the antennaeof Crustaceans and insects may be noticed,which seem, as I have lately observed, analogousto the tentacles of the MoUuscans, and the barbsof fishes ; in some instances, indeed, they areLophius. Plate XIII. Fig. 2.Fn. Greenland, 294. ' See above, p. 2.VOL. II. 1114 LOCOMOTIVE ANDused instead of the fore legs.* The reason whytheir structure differs from the soft, inarticulatetentacles above described, at least in most cases,appears to be the different nature of the integumentsof the animal, which being incased in akind of coat of mail, it seems requisite that bothits locomotive and oral organs should be similarlydefended, and in this case, unless they had beenjointed, they would have lost their flexibility,and so could not have exercised the functionsassigned to them by their Creator. It may,perhaps, be objected that the shell of the snail isnearly as hard as the crust of the lobster; butwhen we consider that the former, when moving,can thrust forth the greatest part of its soft body,as it were from a house, while the crust of theother is really its skin, this objection seems tovanish.Suckers. — The organs I am next to consider,acetabulaj or suckers, are, in many cases, so intimatelyconnected with tentacles, as to form themost essential feature of them, without whichthey can be of no use. In fact, in the Cephalopods,they bear the same relation to the organjust named that the hand or foot do to the armorleg, or the fingers and toes to the hand, inhigher animals : they are the part by which theLitrod. io Ent, ii. 308.PREHENSORY ORGANS. 115animal takes hold of what it wants to seize ; andby the alternate fixing and unfixing of which,upoii a sdiid substance, it moves from place toplace. A sucker * may be defined — An organ bywfaieh an animal is enabled to create a vacuumbetween it, (the organ,) and any surface onwhich it rests, so as to produce a pressure of theatmosphere upon its upper part, and thus causingit to adhere firmly.Cuvier, speaking of the suckers of the Cephalopods,linus describes their action. When theanimal approaches one or more of its suckers toa snr&ce, in order to apply it mwe intimately,it presents it flattened ; when it is fixed to it bythe perfect union of the surfaces, it contracts itssphincter, which produces a cavity, in the centreof which a vacuum is formed. By this mechanism,the sucker attaches itself to the surface witha force proportioned to its diameter, and to theweight of the column of water or of air of whichit 18 the base. This force, multiplied by thenumber of suckers, gives that with which thewhole or part of the legs attaches itself to thebody, so that it is more easy to tear the legs,than to separate diem from the object which theanimal wishes to retainsIn some cases, the action of the suckers, asSuckers are denominated scientifically Acetabular andCotyhEy or Cotyloid processes.Anat.

This structureis to be found in the suckers of the animalthat fixes itself to the gills of the bream, theDiplozoan^ before described and to those ofsome Cephalopods a stout claw is added.When we consider the nature and predatoryhabits of those Cephalopods whose tentacles arefurnished with suckers, often pedunculated, onthat side which is prone when the animalmoves, we shall at once see the reason that thischange from the more common MoUuscan structureof an expansile foot, took place, for hadtheir principal locomotive and prehensory organbeen of this description, or different from whatit is, their motions must necessarily have beenso slow, and their powers of prehension so weak,that they could never have overtaken and captured,and maintained their hold of the welldefended and formidably armed Crustaceans,which are their destined prey. Uncouth,therefore, and misshapen, and monstrous, asthese animals, at the first glance, appear, we seethat in these organs, and doubtless in all others,they are exactly fitted to answer the end, andfulfil the purposes of Divine Providence in theircreation.The suckers of the Diplozomi exhibit a com-Vol. I.

Dr. Nordmannsupposes, that though the animal couldattach itself strongly by these organs, additionalmeans were necessary to render its attachmentsufficiently firm ; and that, therefore, while it isfixing itself by the suckers, it requires the aid ofthe apparatus of hooks, or claws and arches,to keep itself from being misplaced.*The Class of Annelidans exhibits a great varietyof locomotive organs, amongst the rest, inthe last Order, we find suckers these being theprincipal organs for motion of the Hiruditieansor leeches, the animals of which Order, however,M. Savigny is disposed to think are essentiallydistinct from the rest of the Annelidans, onaccount of their want of set€e or lateral bristles.The oral sucker of that division of the animals Iam considering, to which the common leech'belongs, is distinguished from the anal one bybeing formed of many segments, whereas thelatter consists of only one. Their motions, bymeans of these suckers, and the annular structureof their bodies 1 have before sufficientlydescribed'* Their suckers also enable them tolay hold of any aquatic animals that come in> See Normans i. 61. t, v./. 3,4,5.^ Sanguisuga medicinal.

I allude to those of theEchifioderms^ described on a former occasion,' inwhich the ampuUaceous part within the shellpresents the first outline of a shoulder or thigh,the exerted extensile part that of an arm orleg, and the dilated part with which the animalseizes its prey or walks, the hand or foot ; thetwo first constituting the tentacle, and the lastthe sucker.I have, on a former occasion, given someaccount, under the name of the Perch-pests of asingular animal, belonging to the Means,whose history has been given by Dr. Nordmann,and which is distinguished by a sucker commonto two legs. Several other Lerneans have similarsuckers1 See Vol. I. p, 202, 208. Plate III.

Writers on the subject are notagreed as to the means by which this is effected,some supposing that it is by atmospheric pressure,produced by suckers ;^ while others maintainthat it is by a thick-set brush, composed ofshort bristles, on the underside of the foot, or bycertain appendages at the apex of the claw jointof that organs Probably both these causes arein action, for though the pulvilli or foot-cushionsof flies may adhere by mechanical means, thoseof some Hymenoptera and Orthoptera seem evidentlyfurnished with suckers.' In both casesthe design of an Intelligent Cause is apparent ;His wisdom, which, under different circumstances,contrives different means to attain thesame end ; His power, which gives effect to thatpurpose and contrivance ; and His goodness,which causes every varied mean to subserve to1 Philos.

Could we traceexactly the history and habits of every group ofanimals, nay, of each individual species, weshould discover that the slightest variation wasto answer a particular end ; and that even itsvery hairs and pores were all numbered withreference to special uses, foreseen by DivineWisdom.Amongst other purposes for which suckerswere given to the Class of Insects, one bears relationto the intercourse of the sexes. This isparticularly observable in the males of the predaceousbeetles,^ especially the aquatic ones.In the terrestrial ones* indeed something of thekind takes place, for the males may be knownby having the three or four first joints sometimesonly of the anterior tarsi, and sometimes of theintermediate, more or less dilated and furnishedunderneath with short bristles, intermixed, itshould seem, with very minute suckers, and insome with transverse ones.' But these organsare most conspicuous in the male of our mostcommon water-beetles,* in which the three firstjoints of the anterior tarsus form a dilated orbisLat.^ Cicindelid{Bf Harpalida, CarabtdcB^ &c.^ E.

The intermediate legs alsohaye the three first joints thickly set with minutesuckers.Leaving the invertebrated animals the occurrenceof suckers becomes very rare; veryfew instances are upon record, in the whole Sub-kingdomof vertebrated animals, of this kind offormation, two in the Class of fishes and theother in that of reptiles, namely the lump-fishesthe sucking-fishes,' and the Gecko lizards.'Under the name of lump-wishes I include all thosewhose ventral fins unite to form a disk or suckerby which they are enabled to adhere to therocks, constituting Cuvier's family of Discolour.But the most celebrated of this tribe, in ancientas well as modem times, are the sucking-fishesor JScheneis, which Pliny says were so calledfrom their impeding the course of the vessels towhich they adhered. On the back of their headthey have an oval cotyloid disk fitted withnumerous transverse laminae denticulated at theirposterior edge, forming a double series ; by theaid of this apparatus, which appears to adhereby means of the teeth of its laminae asCycloptertu Lumpy &c.Echinus.^ Gecko.

Cuv.122 LOCOMOTIVE ANDwell as by suction, this animal attaches itselfto the whale, the dolphin, the shark, the turtle,and other inhabitants of the waters, and evento vessels that are sailing, and thus organs,which at first sight appear to stop all locomotionin the animal, are the means which enable it,like certain barnacles to traverse half the globe.The fins of this animal do not permit it to swimwith ease and velocity ; and therefore this mustbe regarded as a compensating contrivance, bywhich it can the more readily fulfil its functionsand instincts. Though they are disengaged withdifficulty by human force from the vessel towhich they are fixed, they very easily detachthemselves, and swimming on their back, pursueany object that attracts their attention or excitestheir cupidity.It is singular to remark that in the case oftwo such animals, as the barnacle amongst theCirripedesj which has naturally no locomotivepowers and organs ; and the Echeneis amongstthe fishes, in which they are insufficient to transportit far from its native rocks and haunts, suchmeans shield be afforded by a kind Providenceof visiting in safety the most distant oceans.These animals, though they may be called parasitic,from their adhering to other animals, yet,See above, p. 5.PREHENSORY ORGANS. 123as they do not appear to imbibe any nutrimentfrom them, the design of this singular instinctseems to be merely their transport, for purposesnot yet filly ascertained.Bat there are other fishes whose mouth is avictorious organ, analogous to that of the leech,by which they suck the blood of the aquaticanimals they adhere to ; of this description arethe Lamprey and the Rag but upon these Ishall not further enlarge.The other sucker-bearing vertebrate animals,which I mentioned, were those Saurians whichform the genus Gecko and the object of thisstructure, in them, is to enable then to walkagainst gravity, that thus they may be empoweredto pursue the insects, possessing thesame faculty, up perpendicular or along pronesurfaces. These suckers consisting of transverselaminae, occupy the terminal part of theunderside of the toes. By aid of these organsthey can mount the smooth chunam walls ofhouses in India. Another Saurian genus,^ theGecko, of the West Indies, has a similar organ,by means of which it climbs up trees, as well asthe walls of houses, in the pursuit of insects.The adhesion of suckers and their relaxation,1 Petromyzon. ^ Myxine.3 P kilos.

For instance, invain would the Cephalopods pursue and endeavourto seize and devour the crab or thelobster, if, instead of tentacles set with numeroussuckers, they had the paws and retractile clawsof the Feline race : or how would the Gecko heenabled to overtake its insect provender, if itsfeet were like those of the rest of its class ?As supplementary to this account of suckers,I may mention a locomotive organ, given to avery numerous tribe of invertebrated animals,which, as I observed on a former occasion, appearsin some degree to partake of the natureAchtheres Percarum. See above, p. 118.PREHENSORY ORGANS. 1 25of a sucker, and which is eminently adapted tothe structure, circumstances, and wants of theanimals that are provided with it. I mean theexpanse foot of the great majority of Moluccas: these animals are the only instance of aunited structure in creation, but this one footanswers every purpose of a hand or leg; itspins for the bivalves their byssus,^ is used byothers as an auger ,^ by others as a trowel andby others for other manipulations, and is generallytheir sole organ of locomotion : from its softand flexible substance it can adapt itself to thesurfaces upon which it moves, and by the slimethat it copiously secretes lubricates them tofacilitate its progress. In very dry weather,however, it cannot move with ease over the aridsoil, but when humid from rain, the whole terrestrialMoUuscan army issues forth, naked, orinvarious panoply, each according to its kind,covering the face of the earth, so that it is noteasy to avoid crushing them.The most careless observer of God's creaturesmust be struck by the correspondence betweenthis foot, and the animal to which it is given ;had its locomotions been by means of an organof a solid substance, or by means of several suchorgans, the harmony of structure which now» Vol. I. p. 251. « Ibid. p. 246. » Ibid. p. 289.126 LOCOMOTIVE ANDStrikes us, and relationship between its diffei^^itparts would be done away, and we should thinkwe beheld a mongrel monster engendered bystrange mixtures of animals, rather than acreature harmoniously moulded by the hands ofan anywise Creator.I may also mention here a few other organswhich seem to present some analogy to suckers,and which, though aiding in locomotion, are not,strictly speaking, locomotive organs, or those bywhich locomotion is effected. I allude to thespurious legs, or prologs of the larves of insects.These are usually retractile fleshy organs,analogous to the bristle-armed protuberancesof the Annelidans, rendered necessary by thelength of these animals, and supporting them asprops, and which usually, by means g£ a coronetor semicolon of hooked spines or claws, and byapplying their prone surface to the plane ofposition, take strong hold of it : these legs donot step; the six anterior jointed l^s, wherethey exist, are the walking legs; but theseorgans having been fully described in anotherjoint work of Mr. Spence and mysdf,' I musttherefore refer the reader for Another informationon the subject to that work.What are called the penes or oomb-lifce1 Intro, to Ent. iii. 134.PREHENSORY GROANS. 127organs of scorpions, and those pedunculatedones which are attached to the hind legs of theSolpuga or Gateodesj are conjectured by M»LatreiUe to be connected with the respiration ofthese animals. Amorous seems to regard theformer as a kind of sucker, but no actual observationshave as yet ascertained their real nature,except that the author last named, states that hehas seen the animals use them as feet.Sett or Bristles. Having fully consideredsuckers and their analogues, I shall next advertto a species of locomotive organ, principallyconfined to the Annelidans^ animals whose loco-motionsare chiefly produced by the contractionand expansion of the rings of which their bodyis composed, but which are also furnished withlateral setiform organs, which assist them intheir motion, by pushing against the plane ofposition.The majority of these animals are aquatic,and some of them grow to a great size ; I have aspecimen, which I purchased from the collectionof the late lamented Mr. Guilding, which is morethan a foot long, and as thick as the little finger :it has a double series of what may be denominatedits legs, each furnished at its extremitywith a bunch of very fine retractile bristles,and those of the dorsal series having besides abranchial organ or gill on each side, consisting128 LOCOMOTIVE ANDof numerous threads. This remarkable animalappears to belong to Savigny's genus Pleione^and is probably his P. pedunculatUf and theNereis gigantic of Linn. The bristles in theselegs seem not calculated for pushing on a solidsurface, but are rather organs of notation, analogous,in some degree, to the branching legs ofthe Branchiopod Entomostracans. In the earthwormsthe lateral bristles are simple, and usedto assist their motions, either on the surface, orwhen they emerge from the earth, or make theirway into it.At first sight, one would not suppose thebristles of the Annelidans to be analogues ofjointed legs, or preparatory to their appearancein the great plan of creation; but when wereflect upon the approach which many of theNereideans of Savigny make to the MyriupodCo7idylopeSf* and that these bristle-bearing legs,in Mr. Guilding's genus Peinpatus^^ begin toassume the appearance of articulations, and arearmed at their apex with claws ;^ it seems clearthat the bristles of the Annelidans, and the basewithin which they are retractile, are really legs,and lead the way to the jointed ones of the Con-slopes.I have before noticed the conversion of legs^ Lumhricus.« See Vol. I. p. 346. Plate Vii Fig. 1, 4.3 Ibid. Fig. 1. * Ibid. Fig. 2. c. c.PREHENSORY ORGANS. 129into oral organs, or their use as auxiliariesto them in the case of the Myriapods.* Mr.Savigny, in his description of an animal,^ whichseems the analogue of the electric centipedeobserves that its four anterior legs are convertedinto tentacular cirri, affording an additionalargument for the ancient opinion that the marineMyriapods, as they might be denominated, havesome affinity with the terrestrial since, at leastin this instance, the same number of legs areused as auxiliaries to the mouth.The great majority of the Annelidans inhabitthe water, and the tufts of bristles, sometimesforming fans, issuing in many cases from adorsal and ventral conical protuberance, denominatedby Savigny oars, and occasionally expandingso as somewhat to resemble them, seemin some degree analogous to the branching legsof the Branchiopod and Lernean Entomostra-cans and are probably natatory as well asambulatory organs, and meant by which theirCreator has fitted the locomotive ones to maketheir way through the matted sea weeds and themud, when creeping after their prey, as well asto row through the water like a stately irene.These mary feet, emulating in number those ofthe terrestrial Myriapods, and forming moreover,See above, p. 76.Locris (Egyptian, Pl.

K130 LOCOMOTIVE ANDas was before stated, both a dorsal and ventralseries, must enable them to move with considerablerapidity: those indeed that have observedtheir proceedings, describe them as bothswimming and running with admirable ease andspeed,*There is a Class of vertebrated animals, theOphidians or serpents, which exhibit considerableanalogy to many of the Annelidans, notonly by their form and undulating movements,but also by the organs which effect their progressivemotions, not indeed by means of bristles,but of parts that, pushing against the dane ofposition, propel the animal in any direction accordingto its will.But the way in which this is effected havingbeen clearly and most ably explained by aneminent and learned physiologists I need nothere enlarge upon it, but only observe that themotion of one tribe of the Myriapods, thoughproduced by legs exactly imitates that of theOphidians, though produced by ribs; and veryamusing it is to see the propagation of it fromone extremity to the other in the Millipedes,like wave succeeding wave in the water : a stillmore striking analogy, as has been already re-marked is exhibited by the larger centipedes,1 See Otho Fabricius Faun. Greenland, 289, 298, &c.2 Dr. Roget.See above, p. 6S.PREHENSORY ORGANS. 131which seem almost models of the skeleton ofa serpent.Serpents thus can move not only horizontally,bat also up the trunks of treios, probably in aspiral direction, and some are said to have thepower of darting from one tree to another. Asthese animals are not annulated, like the An-indians,and cannot originate and continue motionby the alternate contraction and extensionof the rings or segments of their body, whichthe nature of their integuments, their vertebralcolumn, and muscular fibre probably preclude,the wisdom of their Creator has subjected theirribs to their will, so that they can use them asmotive organs.Natatory Organs. — The spurious bristle*armed1^8 of the Annelidans, especially those of have as it were led us to the mightyhost of animals furnished with articulated locomotiveor prehensory organs, or real legs andarms, varying in number— but as these will bestfinish the subject, I shall first consider thoseexternal instruments of motion which are peculiarto animals inhabiting the water, or movingthrough the air, beginning with the first, orthose distinguished by natatary organs. I havealready mentioned some of this description, as1 Plate VIII. Fig. 1, 2.132 LOCOMOTIVE ANDthe oars of the paper nautilus and Annelidans^^and also the sails expanded by the formeranimal and several MoUuscans.^ Before I considerthe organs in question, where they aremost conspicuous, in the fishes, I must givesome account of those to be met with amongstthe invertebrated animals, particularly the Con-slopes.Several of the Cephalopods and Ptero-pods, and other MoUuscans, have natatory appendages; in the former, as to many species,looking like little wings, often nearly round,attached to the lower part of the mantle thatenvelopes them ;^ and in the latter assuming theshape and station of the dorsal and other fins offishes though totally different in their structure,not being divided into jointed rays as in theanimals just named.Having mentioned these, I shall next advertmore fully to the organs by which the greatSub-kingdom of animals with articulated legsmove in the waters, whether they always inhabitthem, or occasionally visit them. They may bedivided into three distinct kinds. 1. Jointedlegs dilated towards their extremities, as in thecommon whirl-wig,* the little beetle that formsSee Vol. I. p. 312. « See above, p. 129,« See Vol. I. p. 264. ♦ Plate VII.

Jointed legs, that terminate in a fasciculus ofsetiform branches, and are also connected withthe respiration of the animal, these might bedenominated Branchiremesy and are found inthe Branchiopod Entomostracans.^ 3. Those inwhich the inner side of the jointed leg has adense fringe of hairs, called by Linn, by way ofeminence, pedes natatoriiy such as are found inmany diving* and other aquatic beetles, thesemight be named Setiremes. As the spuriouslegs to which the eggs are attached, observableon the underside of the abdomen of the femalelobster, cray-fish, and other long-tailed Crustaceans,are used also as natatory organs, theyare ciliated for that purpose, and belong to thistribe. The same observation will also applyboth to maxillary legs, and other legs of severalanimals of that Class. The velocity with whichthe diving-beetles move in the water by theaction of these legs, and their suspension ofthemselves at the surface, by extending them so38 to form a right angle with the body, whenth come up for air, and the weather is fineand the water clear, affords a very interestingspectacle.Wagers, Lam. « Plate IX. Fio. 4. c. ^ Dyticus,134 LOCOMOTIVE ANDAmongst natatory organs I muflt not overlookthe tails of the long-tailed Decapod and severalother Crustaceans, which terminate in a powerfulnatatory organ, consisting usually of fiveplates, densely ciliated at their apex, the intermediateone formed of the last segment of theabdomen, and the lateral ones articulating witha common footstalk giving them separate motion,the outer consisting sometimes of two articulations,as in the common lobster, and sometimesof only one, as in the thorny lobster ; theintermediate plate, as in Galatea sometimesconsists of two lobes ; these laminae when expandedform a most powerful natatory oi^an,which, if we consider the weight of their body,must be necessary to keep them from sinking,and by its vertical motion to enable them to riseor sink in the water. But natatory organs arenot confined to those of the trunk and abdomen,even those of the head sometimes assist in thiskind of motion. Thus in Cypress an Entomos-trajan genus, resembling a muscle, the mandiblesand first pair of maxillae have branchialappendages used also in swimming, and their antennaeare likewise terminated by a fasciculus ofthreads, which, according to Jurine, the animaldeveloped, more or less, as it wants to move fasteror slower.*» Liitr. Co\Ar$ Dent. i. 430.PRfiUENSORY ORGANS. 135But the most important natatory organs arethose which enable the vertebrated inhabitantsoi the waters, from the giant whale to the pigmyminnow, to make their way through the waves ;it will be interesting to trace the analogies of thefins of these animals to the locomotive organs,whether wings or legs of other animals, especiallyMammalians. Some we shall find migeneris and calculated particularly for the circumstancesin which the Creator has placedthe great Class of fishes and the rest of the marineanimals ; and others, in the course of ouranalysis, we shall observe gradually assumingthe character and uses of an arm or leg.The fins of fishes are membranes, usually supportedby osseous or cartilaginous rays, whichcan Cfpea or shut, more or less, like a fan, but insome instances they consist of membrane withoutreysy and in others of rays without membrane.The rays are usually divided into twokids; those which consist of a single joint,usually less flexible and pointed, whence they arecalled spiny rays and those which consist of small articulations, generally branchingat their extremity, which are called jointed raysthese jointed rays may be regarded as precursorsof the phalanxes of fingers and toes in the handsand feet of the terrestrial vertebrated animals ;The first pair of fins, which are seldom wanting,13G LOCOMOTIVE ANDand answer to the fore-legs or arms of thoseanimals, are called pectoral and are usuallyplaced on the side behind the gill-covers. Thesecond pair, supposed to be analogous to thehind-leg, are called ventral and are placed underthe abdomen. Besides these, there is often afin along the back, sometimes subdivided, namedthe dorsal fin ; another under the tail, called theanal, and the tail itself terminates in a fin, one ofthe most powerful of all, which is named thecaudal, and in some respects may also claim tobe regarded as the analogue of the legs.The, so called, fins of Cetaceans, are not properlyfins but legs adapted to their element asmarine animals, the anterior pair having all thebones proper to those of mammiferous animals,covered with a thick skin, and wearing the appearanceof a fin. In the sea-cow there arerudiments of nails in their pectoral fins, and theyuse them, both for crawling on shore, and forcarrying their young, on which account they arecalled Manatins,^ of which Lafnantins, theirFrench name, is probably a corruption. Thetail also of the Cetaceans, which is in the shapeof the caudal fin of fishes, and somewhat forked,but placed horizontally, contains some bones,which appear like rudiments of those of legs,thus, for their better motion in an element they1 Senatus Americans,PREU£K.SORY ORGANS. 137never leave, covered by their Creator with a tendinousskin, and enabling them by an up anddown motion to sink to a prodigious depth, or torise from the bottom to the surface of the ocean.If we go from the Cetaceans to the Amphibiouswe see a further metamorphosis of the organs ofmotion. The pectoral fins of the fonder are nowbecome arms, with phalanxes of fingers, claw-armed,but still connected by skin for natatorypurposes, and their caudal fin is converted intoregimental l^s, with a very short interveningtail, and these legs are still of most use in thewater. These circumstances induce some suspicion,especially when we consider that the caudalfin of fishes is their most powerful locomotiveorgan, that it is the real analogue of the hindlegs of the terrestrial mammalian.The ventral fins sometimes seem to changeplace with the pectoral ones. This is the casewith the fishing-frog tribe, in which the formerare nearest to the head, and seem analogous to apentadactyle hand, while the pectoral ones resemblea leg and foot, and the creature lookslike a four-footed reptiles The Rays,' in asystem, are placed at a wide distance from these,and yet they possess several characters in common,particularly in having the hinder part of the1 See Plate XIII.

Courier observes of one ofthem,^ that it can creep on the earth by meansof its fins, like small quadrupeds, and that theirpectorals discharge the function of hind*legs;'so that there seems some ground for thinkingthat they are a branch diverging from the Solarclans towards the Reptiles.Fins, and their analogues, were given to aquaticanimals, it should seem, solely for locomotion ;and could we witness the motions of their differenttribes, each in its place, and observe the play ofthese appendages, we should find them all solocated in the body of the fish, and so nicely measuredwith regard to volume and weight, as tosuit exactly the wants of the animal in its station,and to act as a mutual counterpoise, so thatit should not be overjoyed by the preponderanceof one organ over another; every thingproving that the momentum and action of each,both independently, and in concert with the rest,had been nicely calculated before its creation,by one whose Wisdom knew no bounds, whoseWill was the well being and well doing of hiscreatures, each in its place, and whose Power1 Plate VIII.

How rapidly do they glide,and are lost to our sight by a mere stroke oftheir tail ! at another time, less alarmed, howquietly do they suspend themselves, and ceaseall progressive motion, so that we can discoverthem to be alive only by the fan-like movementof their pectoral fins, an action which seems, insome sort, connected with their respiration ; forthey move them, as I have observed, more rapidly,when, in sultry weather they seek the surfaceand their muzzle emerges. These fins, theanalogue, as has been before observed, of thehand or fore foot, except in a few instances, mayberegarded as usually the first pair of oars thatpropel the vessel. Some fishes, in finont of these,have another locomotive organ and weapons notintended, however, for motion so much in thevater as on the earth ; this is a powerful, andPlate XII.

Every body knows that thepectoral fins of the different species of flyingfishes are very long ; that by them, when leapingout of the water to avoid the pursuit of theirenemies, the bonito,^ and other rapacious fishes,they are supported in the air for a short time ;but the action is really not flying since they usethese fins merely as an aeronaut, in descending,Scomber Pelham,142 LOCOMOTIVE ANDuses a parachute, for a support in the air; infact, flying from aquatic enemies, they are soonattacked by aerial ones, and the frigates andother marine birds, make them their prey — sothat they take short flights, as well as short voyages— sand though they swim rapidly, they aresoon tired, which is the means of saying thosethat escape from their numerous enemies, andpreventing the extinction of the race.

These in the former,the turtles, are formed by the legs and toesbeing covered by a common skin, so as to formakind of fin, the two first toes of each 1^ beingarmed with a deciduous nail.

It may be definedas a natatory organ, formed of several jointeddigitations, covered by a common leathery orscaly integument. In the fossil Saurians thepaddle appears to be formed of numerous bones,arranged in more than five digitations, but it isshorter and smaller, and seems better calculatedVol. L p. 123. * Sphargis coriacea.144 LOCOMOTIVE ANDfor Still waters and a waveless sea than to contendwith the tumultuous fluctuations of theopen oceanNext to the paddles of the Turtles, and fossilSaurianSy come the palmated or web-foot of theaquatic tortoises, and of numerous oceanic birds,in which the toes are united by a commonskin. In the paddle the leg and toes togetherform the natatory organ; in the palmated, orlobed foot, the toes. Thus from fins we seem tohave arrived at digitated legs.Wings. — turning from the denser medium ofwater, we must next inquire what organs havebeen given to animals by their Creator to enablethem to traverse the rarer medium of air, to havetheir hold upon what to the sight appears a nonentity,and to withstand the fluctuating waves ofthe atmospheric sea, and the rush of the fiercewinds which occasionally sweep through spaceover the earth. The name of wings has by generalconsent been given, not only to the featheredarm of the bird but also to those filmyorgans extended, and often reticulated, by bonyvessels — the longitudinal ones in some degreeanalogous to the rays of the fins of the fishes,especially of the flying fishes — which so beautifullydistinguish the insect races ; as well as tothe rib-supported membrane forming the flying1 See Philos.

The first are found ininsects in which they are distinct from the legs ;^ Halithea and Polygon. See Aphrodite Clava. Montaguein Lxjm.

These organsare composed of two membranes, closely appliedto each other, and attached to elasticnervures issuing from the trunk, and accompaniedby a spiral trachea or air-vessel. These nervuresvary in their number and distribution : in someinsects the wing has none except that whichforms its anterior margin," and in others diewhole wing is reticulated by them ;* the Longitudinalones often give an inequality to the surface,and form it into folds, which probably, inflight, it can relax or contract according to cir-^ PsiluSy &c.

In some genera' the wing is foldedLongitudinally in repose, and in others also transversely.*Id the higher animals the wings neverexceed a single pair ; bat in insects the typicalnumber is four; and though some are calledDipterous or two-winged, yet even a large proportionof these have, in the ringlets the rudimentof another pair. The anterior pair, calledelytra, &c. in the beetles, and some others, areprincipally useful to cover and protect the wingswhen unemployed, still they produce some effectin flight, and they partake in a reduced degreeof the motion of the wings, those of the cock-chambersdescribing an arc equal to only a fourthpart of that of the latter organs.M. Jurine, in which he is followed by M.Chabrier, has regarded the primary wing of insectsas analogous to the wing of birds ; butthough this may hold good in some respects, itdoes not in its main feature. If we considerthat the wing of birds is really the analogue ofthe fore-leg of quadrupeds, and replaces it ; andalso that insects have a representative of thatleg fixed to the anterior segment of the trunk,thence called the Manitrunk^ in contradistinctionto the AUtf-unk, which bears the wings ; it seemsnot probable that the anterior leg, and the anteriorwing which belong to different segments,1 Ve^pida. * Cleopatra.3 AlulcB, ♦ Melolontha vulgaris.148 LOCOMOTIVE ANDshould be analogues of the same organ. Thefirst pair of wings, or their representatives, theelytra, are connected with the hip-joints by anintermediate piece called the scapular;' and theposterior wings are connected with the samejoint of the posterior legs by the parapleural^ bothat, in some sort, the wings of insects may beregarded as appendages, — not of the fore-leastor arms, which are the real analogues of thefore-leg of quadrupeds, and wing of birds, — butthe first pair of the mid-legs, and the second ofthe hind-legs.Some winged insects, especially the dragonflies,like the crabs and spiders, can retrogradein their flight, and also move laterally, withoutturning ; thus they can more readily pursue theirprey, or escape from their enemies. The situationof their wings is usually so regulated in themajority with respect to their centre of gravity,as to enable them to maintain nearly a horizontalposition in flight; but in some, as the stag-beetlesthe elytra and wings have their attachmentin advance of that point, so that the head,prothorax, and mandibles do not fully counterpoisethe weight of the posterior part of theirbody, occasioning this animal to assume a nearlyvertical position when on the wing.The apparatus and conditions of flight in birds1 Coxa, See Introdd. to Ent. iii. 661.s Scapulars.

This also may be one reasonwhy insects have usually a greater volume ofwing than birds, and that a very large numberare fitted and adorned with four of these organs,which can sometimes hook to each other, bya beautiful contrivance,' and so form a singleample van to sail on the aerial waves, and bearforward the bluffs-headed vessel. The motions,in the air, of numerous insects are an alternaterising and falling, or a zig-zag onward flight, inadirection up and down, as all know who haveobserved the flight of a butterfly, or a kind ofhovering in the air, or a progress from flower toflower, or backwards and forwards and every wayGeotrupes stercararius, &c. < Mon.

So that every one, whominutely examines them in this respect with anunblessed mind, can hardly help exclaiming,—I trace the hand and pencil of an AlmightyArtist, and of one whose understanding is infinite,and who is in himself the archetype of allsymmetry, beauty, and grace !The wings of a variety of insects, though few,save the Lepidoptera are ornamented with scales,are planted with little bristles more or leasnumerous or dispersed ; these Chabrier thinks,as well as the scales now alluded to, amongstother uses, are means of fixing the air in flight,as well as augmenting the surfaces, and pdlnts ofarrest, in each wing.* They also strengthen thewing and add to its weight, and doubtless haireLepidoptera. • Sur le Vol des Ins* 24.PR£Ii£N80RY ORGANS.

A person expert inswimming or rowing, may easily get an idea» Lit.

Inthe case of the bird, the motion is not backwardsand forwards, but upwards and downwards,which difference, perhaps, is renderednecessary by the rarer medium in which themotion takes place.To facilitate the progress of the bird throughthe air, the head usually finns a trenchant point,that, easily divides it and overcomes its resistance; and often to this is added a long neck,which, in the case of many sea-birds, as wildgeese and ducks, is stretched to its full lengthin flight; while in others, where centre ofgravity requires it, as in the heron, ^ bittern,'&c., it is bent back.The swiftness of the flight of some birds iswonderful, being four or five times greater thanthat of the swiftest quadruped. Directed by anastonishing acuteness of sight, the aquiline tribes,when soaring in the air beyond human ken, cansee a little bird or newt on the ground or on arock, and dart upon it in an instant, like a flashof lightning, giving it no time for escape.

It will be immediatelyseen that I am speaking of the hats and vampyres.These animals, which form the firstFamily of Cuvier's Order of Carnivorous are denominated Cheiropteruy or hand*winged, because in them the four fingers of thehand, the thumb being left free, are very muchelongated so as to form the supports and extensorof the anterior portion of the membraneof which the wing is formed ; while the hind 1^and the tail, in most, perform the same office forthe posterior portion of the wing : so that two1 Struthio. < Aquarius. ^ Les Camassien*PREHENSORY ORGANS. 157wings appear to be united to form one ampleorgan of flight. The membrane itself, whichforms the wing, is only a continuation of theskin of the flanks : as in the wings of insects, itis double, very fine, and so thin as to be semitransparent;it is traversed by some blood*vessels, and muscular fibres — doubtless accompaniedby nerves — which when the wings arefolded form little cavities placed in rows, resemblingthe meshes of a net. As bats are notprovided with air-cells, or air in their bones, likebirds, and their flight is unassisted by feathers,these wants are compensated to them by wingsfour or five times the length of their body*Their flight is of a different character from thatof birds, resembling rather the flitting of abutterfly; when we consider that the peculiarfunction of bats is to keep within due limits thenumbers of crepuscular and nocturnal insects,especially moths, we see how necessary it wasthat they should be enabled to traverse everyspot frequented by the objects their instincturges them to pursue and devour. For thispiu^ose their wings are admirably adapted notonly by their volume, but by their power of contractingthem, and giving them various inflectionsin flight, so that their speed is regulated by theobject they are pursuing.When we further reflect that their eyes aresmall and deep-seated, we may conjecture that158 LOCOMOTIVE ANDit requires extraordinary tact and delicacy ofsensation in some other oi^ns to supply thisdefect in its sight. Spallanzani found thatblind bats fly its well as those that have eyes ;that they avoided most expertly threads of finesilk which he had so stretched as just to leaveroom for them to pass between them ; that theycontracted, at will, their wings, if the threadswere near, so as to avoid touching them ; as wellas when they passed between the branches oftrees; and also that they could suspend themselvesin dark places, such as vaults, to the prominentangles. He deprived the same individualsof other organs of sensation, but theyware equally adroit in their flight, so that beconcluded they must have some pestiferousorgans different from those of other animals toliable them to thread the labyrinths throughwhich they ordinarily pass.Dr. Grant observes on this subject — *batsare nocturnal, but, contrary to what is generallythe case with nocturnal animals, their eyes areminute and feeble, and indeed, comparativelyspeaking, of minor importance, for so exquisiteis the sense of feeling diffused over the surfaceof their membranous wings, that they are aleto feel any vibration of air however imperceptibleby us; they can tell, by the slight rebound ofthe air, whether they are flying near any wall,or opposing body, or in free space though theirPREHENSORY ORGANS. 159eyes be sealed or removed."^ A similar observationwas long ago made by Mr. Bingley.^We see in the circumstances here detailed aremarkable instance of the Pow; Wisdom, andGoodness of the Creator, in compensating for theabsence or imperfection of one or more senses,by adding to the intensity of another, and inestablishing its principal seat in organs so nicelyadapted to derive most profit by the informationcommunicated.An animal nearly related to the vampyres, thecat-apes* commonly called the flying cat, andby some the flying dog, though nearly related tothe bate, and included by Cuvier in the sameFamily, differs essentially from them, in beingfurnished with organs formed by the skin of theflanks connected with the legs of each extremity,which are calculated for suspension rather thanflight, being used, as Cuvi^ remarks, merely asaparachute and thus belong to the second kindof wings, mentioned above. This animal, whichclimbs like a cat, vaults from one tree to another,by the aid of the above skin, which supports itia the air. The petaurisls^* or flying squirrels,and the phalangists^^ or flying opossums aresimilarity equipped, and for a similar purpose.1 Quoted in LU, Gaz.

Providence has evidently added anorgan of suspension, in the case of the threeformer animals, either because their vaults werenecessarily longer, or because the greater weightof their bodies required it.The dreaded name of dragon attached to themonsters of fable, has excited in our imaginationideas of beings clothed with unwonted terrors,from our earliest years, so that when we find theonly animal that inherits their name is an insignificantlizard not more than eight incheslong, we are tempted to exclaim, Parturitionmonies. This little animal, under the name ofwings, is furnished with two dorsal appendagesindependent of the legs, formed of the skin, andactually supported by the six first short ribs,which, instead of taking their usual curvature,are extended in a right line. These organs arenot used to fly with, but to support the animalin its leaps from branch to branch, and fromtree to tree.We see in this instance, how exactly themeans are adapted to the end proposed. Thisanimal walks with difficulty, and consequently1 .Scours vulgaris.PREHENSORY ORGANS. 161seldom descends from the 'trees. It is thereforeenabled to move from one part of a tree toanother, not by its legs, but by an organ formedout of its ris! How various and singular, inthis instance, as well as in that of serpents,before alluded toss are the means adopted by aBeing, who is never at a loss to answer the foreseencall of circumstances by wise expedients.Steering Organs — But wings are not the onlyorgans of flight with which the Creator has fittedthose animals, to which he has assigned the airas the theatre of their most striking and interestinglocomotions. They would be like a ship atsea without a rudder and be altogether at themercy of every wind of heaven, had they nomeans to enable them to steer their vessel throughthe fluctuations of the viewless element assignedto them. The eagle and the vulture would begifted in vain with the faculty of seeing objectsat a great distance, had they no other organthan their sail-broad vans to direct them in theirflight. The same remark will apply as well todie insect as to the bird, which would in vainendeavour to discharge its functions, unless itcould steer its course according to the directionof its will and the information furnished by itssenses. But, upon examination, we shall findSee above, p. 130. • Guhemacula,VOL. II.

But besides thisimportant organ — ^which by the air it is constantlyinspiring adds force also to the internal impulse,and to the air-vessels in the wings — insects haveother auxiliaries to keep them in their rightcourse. Whoever has seen any grasshoppertake flight, or leap from the ground, will findthat they stretch out their hind legs, and, likecertain birds, use them as a rudder.

In flight the tail-feathers appearto be expanded, and probably the bird, bygiving an impulse to either series, can turn thisway or that ; or by their depression or elevation,judging from their analogy with the caudal finof fishes, rise or fall.

Some of thewaders,^ the tail-feathers of which are short, usetheir long legs like the grasshoppers, as arudder in flight, stretched out straight behindthem.Many of the web-footed birds as the gooseand duck tribes, also have these feathers veryshort, which seems a convenient provision foraquatic birds, but whether their legs assist indirecting their course seems not to have beenascertained. Some of them, however, as thepin-tail ducks have the middle feathers of thetail elongated, as they are in many other birds ;in the swallow tribe,* and the sea-swallows theexternal feathers of the tail are elongated, asthese birds are frequently turning when in theair, and flying backwards and forwards ; theirCreator has thus equipped them for their everchanging evolutions. Some birds, as thethrushes magpies and other crows, have allthe tail feathers long, which gives great powerto them in flight.Tetrao Tetrix, « Grallatores. » Palisades.Atuu acute, * Hirundo. .^ Sterna.Turdus, 8 Corvus Pica.PREHENSORY ORGANS. 165The tars of quadrupeds, both oviparous andviviparous, appear, in many cases, to act insome degree as a rudder. They are not onlyuseful to those lately mentioned, that by theassistance of a kind of parachute, leap fromtree to tree ; but likewise to the feline race, whenthey spring upon their prey; the tail is thenextended stiffly in a right line, as if to guidethem through the air straight to the object theyhave been watching from their lair. The longtail also of many lizards may, in their sinuouswindings, serve some purpose connected withtheir locomotion related to the one under discussion,though we have not data sufficient tospeak positively on the subject.Legs — ewe are now arrived at organs that arethe most perfect instruments of locomotion andprehension, organs which are found in theirgreatest perfection in the highest animals, articulatedlegs and arms terminating in the mostperfect instrument, upon the due employment ormisemployment of which the weal or woe of thewhole human race, as far as second causes areconcerned, depend.The legs of animals may be considered generallyas to their number composition and adaptationto their functions.As to their number ^ taking the legs of vertebratedanimals, which may be regarded, being the166 LOCOMOTIVE ANDmost perfect, as a standard to measure others by,we may assume that four is the most perfectnumber. Thus, in man, the highest animal,there are two for locomotion, and two principallyfor prehension. Taking, therefore, man for theultimate point to which all tend, let us see how,in this respect, the scale is formed.We observed in certain tribes of the Angelican approach to jointed legs, and it shouldseem a link, connecting, in some degree, thatClass with the Myriapods; with these last,therefore, we may start in our consideration ofarticulated locomotive organs, and here we finda long body moved by numerous legs, graduallyacquired, as we have seen, with its increasinglength. We may observe, that in the superiortribes of animals, the four l^s being planted inpairs at each extremity of the body, the gradualincrease of stature did not require additionalprops, but only the proportionate growth of theexisting or natal legs and arms ; but in the Myriads,where the great increase of the body inlength is not between the original extremities,but beyond them, additional supports were requisite,so that as the body increased in length, itsCreator, in his goodness willed — that it might notdraw its slow length along like a wounded snakethat it should be furnished at the same timewith a proportionate increase in the number ofits locomotive organs. These animals then, withPREHENSORY ORGANS. 167respect to number of legs, may be regarded asat the foot of the scale, and are the furthestremoved from man.From the Myriapods, we go to the great Cms-taceoH host, in which, including the maxillarylegs the real analogue of the legs of Hexapods,the typical number is sixteen ; and from these,the transition is naturally to the spiders whichhave half that number, and from them to theinsect tribes, walking only upon six legs. Havingarrived at a heaped type, we may observe thatone pair of the legs has a direction towards thehead, and are located in the anterior segment ofthe trunk; and that the other two pairs havea direction the contrary way, towards the abdomen,and are located in that part of thetrunk which bears the wings, and of these,the last pair may be regarded as the representativesof the legs in man, and of the hind legsof quadrupeds.As to the composition of legs, if we take thearm and leg of man for the type t)r standardwith which to compare all the articulated organsof locomotion and prehension with which animalsare gifted, we shall find a considerable,though not an entire, correspondence betweenthem. Anatomists usually divide the at-m^ oranterior extremity, into four principal portions,namely, the shoulder-blades the slwvlder^^ the» Scapula, * Humerus.168 LOCOMOllVfi ANDfwe-army and the hand;* but the leg only itothree — the thighs the shank* and the foot.*The first of these, however, the thigh, inosculateswith the lower part of a bone, called thenameless hone which in very young subjectsforms three, named the hwmch^ the share-bonesand the hip-bone :^ now this bone appearsevidently the analogue of the shoulder-bladein the anterior leg or arm, and thus, admittingthis, both extremities in the number ofprincipal parts correspond with each other.As the vertebrated animals, for the most part,agree with their prototype in the greater articulationsof their anterior and posterior extremities,though much modified in particular instancesand for particular uses, I shall now onlycompare the legs of the great sub-kingdom ofCondylopes, or invertebrated animals with jointedlegs, with those of man, and other Mammalians,and inquire how, in the above respect, they consistof analogous parts.The remarkable distinction which separatesthe vertebrated from the invertebrated animals,namely, that, in the former, the muscles have noexternal points of attachment ; and, in the latter,Cubitus, including two parallel bones, the Ulna and RcuHus.^ Manus, ' Femur,Cis, including also two parallel bones, Tibia and Fibula.Pes. ^ Os innominatum, ^ Os ilium,^ Os pubis. d Os ischium.PREHEN80RY ORGANS. 1 69with a few partial exceptions, no internal ones —most produce a marked difference in all parts oftheir several structures, and, amongst the rest,between their organs of locomotion and prehension: and therefore it is not to be expected thatthey will be perfectly analogous in their composition.Thus in the invertebrates the parts correspondingwith the fore-arm and shank of thevertebrates do not consist of two parallel bones ;the hand and the foot also are essentially different;and the parts by which the extremitiesin one case articulate with the vertebral columntowards its summit and base, and in the otherwith the trunk of the animal at various points,are usually extremely dissimilar: in severalbeetles, however, the basilar joints, especially ofthe hind legs, assume something of the characterand form of the shoulder-blade of Mammalians ;and in certain water-beetles ^ the posterior pairare immoveable. In quadrupeds, usually, thethighs are remarkably clothed with muscle,especially towards their base ; but, in the Covl-slopes, with the exception of some beetles andjumping insects, where a powerful muscularapparatus was requisite, they are not conspicuouslyincrassated, so as to contain muscles ofgreat volume.From these circumstances I am induced toDytiscus, L.1 70 Loco OTTVE ANDconfine my observations to the numeral compositionof the locomotive and prehensory organsof Condylopes, and animals that give sack totheir young.In orde to perceive clearly how far they agreeor disagree in this respect, it will be adviseabkfirst to inquire whether these organs in Condy-lopes themselves can be reduced to a commontype.The Crustaceans and Arachnidans, includingunder the latter denomination all regarded byLatreille as belonging to the Class, at the firstinspection of the organs in question, appear tohave one joint more than insects. This supernumeraryjoint is thefourthf in The Introducedto Entomology named the Epicnemis^^ which isthere regarded as an accessory of the shank.But from further observation, and from a comparisonof this joint of the Arachnidans with ananalogous one in the Crustaceans, in which it islonger and more conspicuous, I feel convincedthat, short as it is in them, it is. really the duskin that Class, and that the long joint usually regardedas the shank is analogous to the first,often dilated and elongated joint of the tarsoflin insects. That this joint belongs to the tarsusor foot will be further evident from the followingcircumstance. If we examine the anterior leg, orVol. iii. 668.< £. G. In the Bees and many other Hymenoptera.PREHEN80RY ORGANS. 171aim, of the lobster or crab we shall find that thejoint in question, which is the fifth of the legsis what is called the metacarpal joint, a processof which forms the index or finger of the didac-style hand or forceps of these animals, and thesucceeding and terminal joint the opposingthumb. It is evident, therefore, that this jointbelongs not to the shank or cubit, but to thefoot; and that consequently a Crustacean orArachnoid leg or arm numerically correspondsin its greater articulations with that of an insect.Haying proved, I hope, to the satisfaction ofthe reader, that the legs of Condylopes, withregard to the number of their principal articulationsare reducible to one type, — sunless we mayexcept some of the Acartdans^ or mites, and theBranchiopod EntomostracoMSy which appear reducibleto no general rule — I shall next endeavourto show that the Condyle leg does notusually difier numerically fi*om that of the quad-spedor mammalian ; and that the former consistsof only fear principal articulations as wellas the latter, and it will not require many words,or any laboured disquisition, to prove this. The,10 called, trochanter is, with great propriety, consideredby M. Latreille as being a joint of thethigh, as it really is, and in many cases, especiallyin Coleopterous insects, has no separatePlate X. Fig. 1.172 LOCOMOTIVE ANDmotion ; consequently if this opinion be admitted,the number of articulations, both in theCondylopes and Mammalians, will be the same.Animals that are built upon a skeleton, or incasedin an external crust or rigid integumentin order to have the power of free locomotionand prehension, must necessarily be fitted withjointed organs, whose articulations are morenumerous at the extremity, where the principalaction is, that those parts may so apply to surfacesas to enable the animal to take sufficienthold of them for either of the above purposes.There is a circumstance connected with thelegs of insects which, at first sight, seems tothrow some doubt upon this conclusion. Theshank has often at its apex, and sometimesthe cubit, certain little moveable organs, whichhave been called spurs but which really appearto aid the animal in its locomotives and insome they even terminate in suckers :* as theseorgans are co-ordinate with the jointed tarsus,they seem in some sort a kind of auxiliary digitation.In the mole-cricket ^ the structure isstill more anomalous, the cubit terminating infour strong digitations or claws, opposed towhich is the, so called, tarsus, which seems analogousin some sort to a jointed thumb, so thatthe whole represents a pentadactyle hand.

At the first blush, and before wewere acquainted with its habits, should vechance to meet with a giraffe so striking is theseeming disproportion of many of its parts, thatwe should be tempted to take it for an abortionin which the posterior parts were not fully desCamehpardalis Giraffe.PREHKNSORY ORGANS. 175eloped. Observing its length of neck and le*sated withers, the apparently unnatural declivityof its back, and the comparative lowness of itshind quarters we should conclude that suchmust be the case. But if we proceeded to inquireinto the nature of its food, and were toldthat it subsisted by cropping the branches ofcertain trees which thus it was enabled to reach,the truth would flash upon us, we should immediatelyperceive the correspondence between itsstructure and its food, and acknowledge the designand contrivance of a benevolent Creator inthis formation.A similar idea would perhaps occur to us thefirst time we saw a jerhoa^^ or a hanguroo.^Hasselquist says of the former*— that it might bedescribed as having the head of a hare, thewhiskers of a squirrel, the snout of a hog, thebody, ears, and fore-legs of a mouse, like those of a bird, with the tail of alion ; and an ancient zoologist would have madea monster of it that might have rivalled thechimera. The kanguroo also would have metwith a similar fate* Though the jerboa is not amarsupian animal like the kanguroo, yet theyhave many characters in common. They bothhave very slender fore-quarters, and short andtender fore-legs; their hind-quarters, on thecontrary, are remarkably robust and incrassated,^ Dipus. * Macropus,176 LOCOMOTIVE ANDand they sit erect, resting upon them like a hare ;both have a long powerful tail, which they useas a fifth leg. The object of this formation, atthe first glance, so at variance with all ideas ofsymmetry, appears to be a swifter change ofplace, and more ready escape from annoyanceor violence. The jerboa is stated to take verylong leaps, and those of the kanguroo are said toextend from twenty to twenty^ight feet, andthey rise to an elevation of from six to eight feet.When they leap they keep their short fore-legpressed close to their breast, and their long androbust tail, having first assisted them in theirleap, is extended in a right line. A double endis answered by their peculiar structure ; sittingon their haunches, they can leisurely lookaround them, and if they spy any cause ofalarm make off by the means just stated. Theirattenuated fore-quarters and short fore-legs renderingit much more easy for them, oversteppingevery obstacle, to dart into the air ; their centreof gravity is then removed nearer the hindquarters, so that the tail can act as a counterpoiseto the anterior part of the body.The jerboa also, like the kanguroo, whenalarmed, springs into the air. When ready totake flight, it stands, as it were, on tip-toe, supportingitself by its tail. Its fore-legs are thenapplied so closely to the breast as to be invisible,whence the ancients called it Disuse orPREHENSORY ORGANS. 177biped;* having taken their spring they alightupon their fore-feet, and elevating themselvesagain, they are off so rapidly, that they seemto be always, so to speak, upon the wing.They use their long tail to support themselveswhen they recover from their leaps, giving it thecurvature of the letter S reversed, thus, c» •When their tail has been shortened at differentlengths, it has been found that their leap isdiminished in the same proportion ; and whenit was wholly cut off they could not leap at all.We see, in one Order of the Birds theWaders, a remarkable disproportion of the legsto those of the rest of the Class ; they look as ifthey walked upon stilts, whence the name of theOrder, so disproportionate long are their legs tothose of the generality of birds. I have beforenoticed the use of these legs to them in flyingbut the principal object of this structure is toenable them to prey upon aquatic animals,fishes, worms, and the like. Whoever is in thehabit of frequenting estuaries, and other waters,will generally see some of these birds, asherons and bitterns, standing in them, where• Herodotus. Melton, § 192. Ed. Reizii.It is to be observed in general, with respect to the Class ofBirds that the conspicuous part of their legs is not the shank,which is chiefly covered by muscle and feathers, but is formedof the tarsal and metatarsal bones united into one.• See above, p. 164.,VOL. II. N178 LOCOMOTIVE ANDshallow, and ever and anon dipping their heads,and then emerging swallow their capture. Thedesign of this structure must be obvious to everyeye, namely, to qualify these birds of prey toassist in keeping within due limits the populationof the various waters of our globe, whichother predaceous animals cannot come at.Another tribe of long l^^d birds, whichCuvier considers as belonging to the presentOrder, though their habits and habitat are altogetherdifferent, and which constitute hisfamily of short-winged watered* is that to whichthe Ostrich* and Emu* belong, but in these theobject of this structure is to fit them not forstanding in the water, but for running in thesandy desert ; and such is the velocity of theostrich that it can outstrip the fittest Arabiancourser when pursued.Other birds are remarkable for the shortnessand strength of their legs ; of this descriptionare the aquiline race, which are thus fitted bytheir Creator for seizing and holding fast anyprey which their piercing sight discovers.There is one, and a very elegant bird, belongingto this Order, the secretary-bird,* the legsof which are so long, that many ornithologistshave arranged it with the waders. It is, how-embassiesbrevipennes, ^ Struihio Camels.5 Aquarius Emeu. * Ophiotkeres abstains, Weill.PREHENSORY ORGANS. 179ever, very properly placed amongst the predaceousbirds. Its long legs are given it to enableit to pursue the serpents, which form its food.We see, in this instance, a departure fi*om oneof the typical characters of its own tribe, andthose of another adopted in order to accommodatethe animal to the circumstances in whichit was the Divine will to place it, and to fit it forthe fiction which it was there to exercise.Amongst the Reptiles there is little diversity,as to the relative proportions of the organs weareconsidering, and their parts ; in the Barrasor frogs and toads, which are mostlyleaping and swimming animals, the hind legsare elongated to accommodate them to thosekinds of locomotion ; and in some of the Syriansor lizards, which are approaching to theOphidians or serpents, the legs are very shortsand sometimes reduced to a single pair ; ^ evenin some serpents rudiments of a pair of legs leavebeen discovered, particularly in the Boa.*Some insects are remarkable for the vastlength of their anterior pair of legs ; what maybethe object of this formation has not beendiscovered except that, in one instances it isfound only in one. sex.

The forelegsof the male are more than twice the lengthof the body, while those of the female, thoughlonger than the others, are scarcely half solong.Many insects are formed, in some degree,after the pattern of the kangaroo and the jerboa,in order to enable them to transport themselvesby leaping beyond the reach of their enemies.The thighs of their hind legs are incrassated soas to afford a box capable of containing musclessufficiently powerful, by their action, to sendthem through the air to an almost incredibledistance. If we examine the structure of theposterior legs of any common grasshopper weimmediately see, both from the position of thejoints with respect to each other, and the shapeand volume of the elongated thigh, that they aremade for leaping. The shank, when the animalprepares to leap, forms an acute angle with thethigh, so that being suddenly unbent, it springsforward, often to the distance of two hundredtimes its own length. Many carriages are setupon springs made to imitate the position ofthis insect preparing to leap, which are knownby the name of grasshopper springsSeveral beetles rival the grasshoppers in theirleaps, and have their posterior thighs much^ See Introduction to Entomology ^ ii. 310.PREHENSORY ORGANS. 181disproportioned to the bulk of their bodies,which allow space for a sufficient muscular apparatus,to send them, like an arrow from a bow,to a great distance. If a finger be held to a leafcovered by the turnip flea in the twinkling ofan eye, all skip off and vanish. We may henceimagine with what expedition they disappear atthe approach of any insectivorous bird. Thustheir Creator, who cares for the meanest of hiscreatures, has furnished them with means ofescape, to prevent their annihilation, and topreserve them in such force, as may best answerbis end in creating them.But besides partial modifications of the strictureof these organs for particular uses, othersare more general and affect the whole leg.Every one is aware how well adapted, by theirfleetness, some of the Ruminant Mammaliansare to make their escape from their ravenouspursuers, the most adroit and the most ruthlessof which is the mighty hunter man.If we look at the legs and hoofs of the deertribes the former long, slender, and elastic ; andthe latter calculated for sure footing ; and if weconsider besides the quickness of their senses ofseeing and hearing, we see at once that theirstructure is the effect of-designs and that theHalHcu oleracea, Decorum, Sfc. ^ Cervus, L.182 LOCOMOTIVE ANDdeepest intellect presided at its first fabricationThough man, as well as every ferocious beast,pursues these beautiful and elastic animals, it isonly because he is Glib dedimus seldom with anyview to seek their alliance, or to turn them tohis purposes. There are some, however, as wellas the rein deer,* cherished by the Laplanderas his principal treasure, but pursued by theAmerican savage only to be devoured, whichprobably might be employed with advantage, aswell as the dog, in countries not suited to ourbeasts of burthen; «tnd it has been supposedthat the Wapiti* might be trained and rendereduseful, I am ignorant, however, whether anysteps have ever been taken to ascertain this.But the legs, as well as instruments of flightand escape, are adapted in fiercer animals tothe pursuit and prehension of their prey, and inthis, and many other respects, their hand orfoot is the part principally interesting. This isused for so many various purposes, that perhapsit will be best to take a summary survey, in thisrespect, of all the Classes of animals with articulatedlegs, and briefly point at their differentstructures and their uses.As I have already given an account of thetwo kinds of forceps of Crustaceans I shall» See Roget, B, T, i. 506. 2 Cervus TarantulaC. Stongyloceras, ♦ See above, p. 37, 38.PREHENSORY ORGANS. 183b^Q with the leg of the Arachnidans^ orspiders. Every one who examines the web of acommon spider, whether it is formed of concentriccircles supported by diverging rays, orwhether it imitates any finely woven substance,will be convinced that she must be furnishedwith a peculiar set of organs to effect thesepurposes : that she must have something likea band to work with. Amongst the small thingsthat are wise upon earth, Solomon mentionsthe slider ; and the way by which he tellsus she shews her wisdom is by her prebendarypowers — she takes hold with her handsAnd truly what Arachne does with her handsand her spinning organs is very wonderful, as Ishall have occasion hereafter to shew; I shallnow only make a few observations upon theorgans by which she takes hold.Spiders are gifted with the faculty of walkingagainst gravity, even upon glass, and in a proneposition. According to the observations of Mr.Blackwall, this is not effected by producingatmospheric pressure by the adhesion of suckers,but by a brush formed of *' slender bristlesfringed on each side with exceeding fine hairsgradually diminishing in length as they approachits extremity, where they occur in suchprofusion as to form a thick brush on its inferiorProw. XXX. 28.184 . LOCOMOTIVE ANDsurfaces These brushes he first discovered ona living specimen of the bird-spiders and thesame structure, as far as his researches werecarried, he found in those spiders which canwalk against gravity and up glass. This is oneof the modes by which they take hold with theirhand stand thus they ascend walls, and set theirsnares in the palace as well as the cottage.Whoever examines the underside of the lastjoint or digit of the foot of this animal with acommon pocket-lens, will see that it is clothedwith a very thick brush, the hairs of which,under a more powerful magnifier, appear somewhathooked at the apex ; in some species thisbrush is divided longitudinally, so as to formtwo.But the organs that are more particularly connectedwith the weaving and structure of thesnares of the spiders are most worthy of attention.Setting aside the hunters and othersthat weave no snares to entrap their prey, Ishall consider those I intend to notice, underthe usual names of weavers and retiaries.^Before Mr. Blackwall turned his attention tothe proceedings of these ingenious and industriousanimals, it had not been ascertained, inwhat respect their modes of spinning theirBlackwall in Linn.

But Mr.Blackwall, whose observations were principallymade upon one of the weavers which frequentsthe holes and cavities of walls and similarplaces, observes that it spins a kind of web ofdifferent kinds of silk, the surface of which hasaflocky appearance, from the web being as itwere ravelled.This web is produced, he observes, by adouble series of spines, opposed to each other, andplanted on a prominent ridge of the upper-sideof the metatarsal joint, or that usually regardedas the first joint, of the foot of the posterior legson the side next the abdomen. These spinesare employed by the animal as a carding apparatus,the low series combing, as it were, orextracting, the ravelled web from the spinners,*and the upper series, by the insertion of itsspines between those of the other, disengagingthe web from them.* By this curious operation,which it is not easy to describe clearly, theadhesive part of the snare is formed, thus laisseflies are easily caught and detained, which theanimal, emerging from its concealment, soondespatches and devours.The organs by which the retire spiders formtheir curious geometric snares have generallyClubiona atrox, ' Mammulfe.^ Blackwell, ubi sup. 473.186 LOCOMOTIVE ANDbeen described as three claws, the two uppermostarmed with parallel teeth like a comb, andthe lower one simple and often depressed; butMr. Blackwall found, in a species related tothe common garden spider eight claws, sevenof which had their lower side toothed Theobject of this complex apparatus of claws simpleand pectinated, is to enable these animals to takehold of any thread ; to guide it ; to pull it ; todraw it out ; to ascertain the nature of any thingensnared, whether it be animate or inanimate;and to suspend itself. In fact the Creator hasmade their claws not only hands but eyes tothese animals.Besides these organs, scattered moveablespines or spurs are observable upon the legs, especiallythe three last joints, which I consider 88forming the foot, but sometimes also upon thethighs of spiders, which, as they can be elevatedand depressed at the will of the animal, probablyare used as a kind of finger, when occasionsrequire it.In the multiform apparatus of these ingeniousanimals as far as we understand its use, we seehow they are fitted for their office, by contributingto deliver mankind from a plague offlies, which would otherwise, like those whichEpeira Diadema, The species examined by Mr. B. wasE. apoclisa.Blackwall, ubi sup. 476.PREHENSORY ORGANS. 187swarmed in Egypt, annoy us beyond toleration,and corrupt our land.If the spider taketh hold with her hands, andspreads her snare in kings' palaces, what shallwe say of the bee, who with her hands erectsherself her many-storied palaces, each storyconsisting of innumerable chambers, far moredurable, and built of a material infinitely exceedingthe flimsy webs of Arachne. HerCreator hath instructed her, and fitted her withthe means, to gather from every flower thatblows a pure and sweet nectar, from which,received into her stomach, she elaborates thebeautiful and important product of which herwondrous structures are formed ; and from thesame source she is also instructed to load herselfwith a fine ambrosial dust, which, kneaded byher into a paste, constitutes the chief subsistenceof herself and the young of the community towhich she belongs.Almost every organ, implanted in her frameby her beneficent Creator, is employed by thissymbol and exemplar of virtuous industry asahand in her several works and manipulations.Her antenfUBj those still mysterious organs, informher in what flowers she may find honey,and which to pass by ; they plan and measureher work, and by them she examines whetherall is right ; she also uses them to converse withher associates, and for various other purposes ;188 LOCOMOTIVE ANDher tongue is likewise an instrument equallyuseful to her ; it can assume various shapes as occasionsdemand ; it collects the honey from thenectar-organs of the flower ; it tempers the waxfor building and prepares it for the action of themandibles. With these last organs she worksup the wax till it is fit for use. The plumy hairsof her body, especially in the humble-bees, areuseful in detaining the dust of the anthers. Herlegs more particularly the posterior pair, thoughnot used immediately in her structures, are extremelyimportant organs, both for preparingher food and the material with which she buildsher palace. At the junction of the shank, withthe first joint of the foot of this pair, a kind offorceps is formed, by the angle at the apex ofthe former and the base of the latter, with whichthe bee takes a plate of wax from the wax-pocketsunder her abdomen, and delivers it tothe anterior pair of legs, by which it is submittedto the action of the mandibles. Theshanks of the posterior legs likewise on theirupper side have a cavity surrounded with hairs,which form a kind of basket, in which the diligentlabourer carries a mass of pollen, kneadedby the aid of the comb at the end of theshank into a paste, which is deposited in thecells, and contributes to form the family store ofprovision .What a number of compensating contrivancePREHBNSORY ORGANS. 189does this single animal exhibit, and how wonderfullyand admirably has Supreme Wisdom andGoodness contrived for her, and AlmightyPower given full effect to what they planned !Nothing is superfluous in her, every hair andevery angle has its use ; so that well may weadore Him who created the honey-bee, and, atwhose bidding, and by whose instruction, sheerects those wonderful edifices that have beenthe admiration of every ageInstinct directs many animals, as well astraversing the surface of the earth, to seek asubterranean abode within its bosom.

If he compares other crickets with it, asingular change will strike him, the bulk of theposterior thighs, far exceeding that of the samejoint in the other legs, will appear to be chieflytransferred to the anterior pair of legs, which,the size of the creature considered, are as powerfulinstruments for excavating the earth as canbe found in any animal now in existence : allthe joints of this leg are very much dilatedespecially the haunch and the thigh, which consSee Chart Hierozoic, ii. 516. a.

This consists of a triangularjoint, the analogue of the shank of theother legs, but assuming the form of a hand withthe palm turned outwards, as in the mole, andterminating in four strong claw*like digitations ;on the side next the head these fingers, in themiddle, are longitudinally elevated and naked;while the sides are longitudinally excavated andhairy, which give this part some resemblance tothe foot and claws of burrowing quadrupeds.The thigh is hollowed out underneath, evidenceto receive the joint just described, and overhangingthis cavity, at the base, is a stout triangulartooth, which probably is employed toclean the hand when necessary ; on the outsideopposed to the hand is the analogue of the tarsusconsisting of three joints, the two first laisse andtriangular, with the upper edge curved and thelower straight and hairy at the base, the otheris of the ordinary form, and armed with twostraight claws. These teeth, as well as those ofthe shank, have a trenchant edge on the straightside, and together are supposed to act the partof a pair of shears, and to cut any roots that mayinterfere with its progress. Rose, however,thinks, the use of these teeth of the tarsus ismerely to clean the burrowing hand, which itmay also do.

The apex of the shanks, ofthe two posterior pairs of legs, is armed withseveral spines which probably assist either inmaking progress, or, when necessary, to retrograde.It might, i think, be asserted' observes Dr.Kidd, in his valuable and interesting memoirOn the atmt&fny of the mol^cricket^^ " withoutfear of contradiction, that throughout the wholerange of animated nature, there is not a strongerinstance of what may be called intentionalstructure, than is afforded by that part of themole-cricket (the etmteriar leg)^ which I am nowto describes'' And certainly, we see and ownwithout hesitation, as even the most scepticalwould Scarcely refuse doing, that this arm wasplanned, and all its various parts, dependentupon and mutually affecting each other, by acalculating Mind, which framed and put thewhole together to answer a particular purpose.• Pklloi.

Like Mammalians, reptilesare usually furnished, but not invariably,with four legs, and a pentadactyle foot.In an animal of this Class, celebrated from ofold, the Chameleon a remarkable modificationof this structure is observable. It is stated withrespect to this animal, that it moves very slowly,that it will sometimes remain whole days on thesame branch : and it is only with great circumspection,and after taking great care to get firmhold with its prehensile tail, that it ventures toset a few steps: it may be expected, therefore,that its principal organs of locomotion should beadapted to give it secure footing on the branchit selects for its station.Aristotle, in his account of this animal,^ observesthat " each of its feet is divided into twoparts, an arrangement resembling that of ourthumb, opposed to the rest of the hand ; and alittle short of this,* each of these parts is dividedinto certain fingers ; in the fore-legs the internalHyla, ' ChamcBleo africans &c.Aristot.

By this structure of the feet,and arrangement of the fingers or toes, thethree-toed lobe is on one side of the branch atthe anterior extremity of the animal, and on theother at the posterior, and by this counteractionof each other's pressure, enable it to maintain itsposition against any force that may be likely todisturb it. The lobes are longer than the fingers,and thus by their means it can hold very firmly,and watch the flies and insects which form itsfood, and are entrapped by the gluten withwhich its long tongue is besmeared.The analogue of the fore-leg of quadrupedsin hirdsj as we have seen, is converted into anorgan of flight, and cannot be employed as anorgan of prehension ; sometimes, indeed, in theircombats, it is used to annoy their opponents, andis occasionally armed with a spur, but the prehensoryfaculty is transferred to the beak andthe remaining pair of legs ; with these latter theeagles and other birds of prey usually seize theanimals that they devour ; with these also fructusbirds, as the parrots, paroquet, &c. hddthe fruit while they eat it, and the Gallinaceous» Plate XIV.

Some indeed employ their tongue in thisservice. Of this description is the woodpecker'and the humming Bird ;^ the former using it tocatch insects and the latter to imbibe the nectarof flowers, for which purpose these little gemsamongst the birds have a long slender tongue,somewhat resembling that of a butterfly, andmoved by an apparatus, in some degree, likeSeansores, * Picus,5 Trochilus. * See Dr. Roget, B.

Perhaps in none isit more remarkable than in those of Cuvier'stwo last Orders, the waders and web-footedbirds. These, especially the last, can use theirl^;s only for locomotion, either on shore or indie water, and therefore their beaks have thewhole function, not only of taking, but of huntingfor food devolved upon them, and accordinglyare fitted for it by their structures Generallyspeaking, they may be stated to be of twokinds. Beaks for catching worms, and beaks forcatching fishes ; of the first description are thoseof the woodcock,' snipes and numerous otherwaders ; and of the last, amongst the most remarkable,are those of the spoonbilP and pelican.*The former — which the French, perhapswith more propriety, call the spatula-bills ^ itsbeak resembles a spatula rather than a spoon —dabble with their bill in the mud, for which it iswell calculated, and thus capture small fishes,shell-fish, reptiles, and other aquatic and amphibiousanimals, which the tubercles within itare also calculated to retain and crush.

Thelower mandible is fitted with a kind of sac,formed of the dilated skin of the throat, whichYieillot says can be so expanded as to containbetween two and three gallons of water .^ Whenfishing these birds, sometimes, rise to a prodigiousheight, at others they skim the surfaceof the water, or hover, at a moderate elevation,that they may more readily precipitate themselvesupon their prey. The sudden fall of sopowerful an animal, the whirling round, theboiling which the great extent of its wings occasionsin the water, so astounds and stuns thefishes that few escape. Then rising again andagain descending, it continues this manoeuvretill it has filled its pouch. When this is accomplishedit retires to some rocky eminence whereit devours what it has caught, which sometimes,Yieillot says, will amount to as many fishes aswould satisfy six men.' It presses its pouchagainst its breast when it feeds its young, inorder to disgorge the fishes, whence probablyarose the fable of its feeding them with its ownblood.But the beak is not only used by birds incollecting their food, some also it assists inN.

Wellmight our Saviour say. Behold the fowls of theair ; for they sow not, neither do they ready norgather into barns; yet your Heavenly Fatherseemeth themThe legs of Mammalian with respect to theirextremity, may be considered as divided intothose that have powers of prehension, more orless, and those that have only powers of locomotion.I shall begin with the latter.1 . These consist of Baron Cuvier's seventh andeighth Orders of the Class above mentioned;namely, the Pachyderms or thick skinnedbeasts, and the Ruminants or those that chewthe cud.The great man, just named, considers thehorse and ass, constituting the equine genus,^as forming a Family of the first of these Orders,to which he has given the ancient appellation of^ Match. vi. 26. « Eques.198 Locomotive ANDSolipedf^ or whole-hoofed. He originally regardedthe Solipeds as forming a separate Order,and, indeed comparing them with the otherPachyderms, as the elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus,hog, &c,, the horse genus seemsscarcely to belong to the same Order. Milliner,who altered the name, but without sufficientreason, to SoUdungvla^ considers them as distinct.Though the speed of the deer, except in asingle instance, on account of their usually slightform and slender limbs, has not been applied byman to his purposes, and to add to the Velocityof his progress, yet in the soliped race, especiallyin that thole quadruped the horses wehave an' animal endowed with equal speed andgreater strength, and by their undivided hoof,where speed as well as strength is required, calculated,with much more advantage and less injury,to traverse — both as beasts of burthen anddraft, and as adapted peculiarly for the conveyanceof man himself— not only soft andverdant prairies, but hard and rocky roads.Hence this animal has been employed by manfrom a very early period of society. We do notindeed know whether the mighty hunter, Nimrod,went to the chase of man and beast onhorseback, though it is not improbable ; but both^ Gr. MoFv^. Aristot.PREHENSORY ORGANS. 199the bribe and the ass were common in Egypt inJoseph's time the latter was used by Abrahamto ride upon and asses are enumeratedamongst his possessions when he went up fromEgypt fifty years before.*The sole organs of prehenuon of this tribe aretheir mouth and upper lip. Every one knowshow adroit the horse and ass often become inthe use of these organs, not only in gatheringtheir food but in opening gates that confinethem to their pastures.In the genuine Pachyderms the foot begins toshow marks of division. In the rhinoceros thereare three toes, in the hippopotamus four, and inthe Propositions of Cuvier, including the elephantand Mastodon or fossil elephant, thereare five toes, three of the nails of which onlyappear externally, and four on the hind-foot ofthe Asiatic speciesThe Swine family divide the hoof like the Ruminants;it consists of two intermediate toes,large, and armed with nails or hoofs, and twolateral ones much shorter and not touching theground ; in this respect also resembling manyRuminants. In hilly and mountainous districtsthese upper toes are probably useful in locomotion.The prehensory organ of the animals hereGenes. xWiu 17. < xxii. 3. ' xii. 16. * E. indus.200 LocoMonvB andenumerated is usually the snout, ynih this thehog ' turns up the ground in search of roots orgrubs, often doing great injury to pastures. Themale is armed with a defensive and oiensiTeweapon in his tusks.That hideous animal of this tribe, the Ethiopianboar is armed with four tusks, two proceedingfrom the upper jaw, which turn upwardslike a horn, sometimes nine inches long and fiveinches in circumference at the base ; the otherpair issuing from the lower jaw, projecting notmore than three inches from the mouth, flat onthe inside, and corresponding with another plainsurface in the upper tusks. The Bushes men,Sparrman relates, say of this animal, '' We hadrather attack a lion in the plain than an Africanwild boar ; for this, though much smaller, comesrushing on a man as swift as an arrow, andthrowing him down snaps his legs in two, andrips up his belly before he can get to strike at it,and kill it with his javelins They inhabitsubterranean recesses; and turn up the earthvery dexterously, probably by the aid of theirtusks, in search of roots, which form their food.The Sabiroussa* or Babes roost, a name whichsignifies Hog-deer given to this animal probablyon account of its longer legs and slender form, isdistinguished by a pair of long tusks from theSus scrofa, * Pluucockomu Africans.3 Voyage, ii. 23. * Sus bmhynusa.PREHENSORY ORGANS. 201Upper jaw, which rising above the head, thentaming down, form a semicircle, and have theappearance of horns, for which they have beenmistaken. They are only found in the male,which is stated to use them as hooks to suspendhimself to the branches of trees, thus resting hishead, so as to sleep upright. As the animalfeeds upon the leaves of the Banana and othertrees, it is not improbable that these tusks maybeused to pull down the branches.The Rhinoceros is said to use its horn fordigging up the roots of plants, which composethe principal portion of its food. I am speakingof the two*horned rhinoceros of Sparrman . TheHottentots and the colonists assert that this animaluses only its second or shortest horn fordigging up roots, which appeared to him wornby friction, marks of which the anterior onenever exhibited. When engaged in that employmentit was stated to turn that horn on oneside' out of the way.But one of the most wonderful compensatingcontrivances and structures of Divine Wisdom,Power, and Goodness, and which has excitedthe admiration of every age, is the proboscis ofthe elegant. The weight of the enormous heado( this animal is such as to preclude its beingemployed, if it terminated in a common mouth,1 Seaman. Voyage, ii. 98.202 LOCOMOTIVE ANDeither to break the boughs of trees, or to crop thegrass, for it could not easily be either elevated ordepressed for these purposes; in its proboscis,however, it is supplied with an instrument thatamply compensates this deficiency. Almost everyoneis aware that this beautiful organ, beautiful Imean for its structure,* answers a variety of purposes; that it is given by its Creator to this mightyanimal to be to it an instrument almost of sight,of most delicate touch, of scent and breathing, ofprehension as adroit as that of a hand ; added tothis, that by the extraordinary flexibility withwhich he has endowed it, it can not only beinflected inwards to carry things to its mouth,but be bent upwards, downwards, or laterally, tolay hold of things above, below, or on each sideof it, and that by the assistance of a single fingerat its extremity, it can take hold of any thing asreadily as we do by the assistance of four fingersand a thumb. As the brain of these giganticanimals, compared with their bulk, is veryshall, it is thought, by modern zoologist, thattheir intellect has been exaggerated, and that itdoes not surpass that of dogs, and many othercarnivorous animals. Others have imaginedthat their sagacity is wildly the result of theirbeing provided with so wonderful an organ ; butthis organ would be of very little use withoutRoget, B. T. i. 520.PRBHENSORY ORGANS. 203the ftetT&Us apparatus by which it is movedaccording to the will of the animal.Amongst the Rumiimnts^ — which appear toconnect with the Pachyderms in two points, bythe swine tribe and SoUpeds, the latter possessingseveral characters in common with the Gnu^^which seems between them and the bovinegenus ;^ and the former approaching them bytheir common character of dividing the hoof, —there is another animal, which may be consideredas the horse of the desert, exhibiting in somedegree a union of characters not foimd in theremainder of the Order ; it chews the cud, butdoes not actually divide the hoof. I am speakingof the Comely but though not actually, the hoofis superficially divided. Considering the desertsof loose and deep sand that it often has totraverse, a completely divided hoof would havesuoJk too deep in the sand; while one entirebelow would present a broader surface notso liable to this inconvenience. Boys, when theywant to walk upon the muddy shores of ane^xiary at low water, fasten broad boards totheir feet, which prevent them from sinking inthe mud ; I conceive that the whole sole of theeftmel's iooi answers a similar purpose: itssuperficial division probably gives a degree ofpliancy to it, enabling it to move with more easeCatoblepas Gnu, * Bos,204 LOCOMOTIVE Andoverthe sands ; upon which these animals oftentrot with great rapidity, travelling sometimestwelve miles within the hour ; its common amble,which is exceedingly easy, is nearly six ; thispace, if properly fed every evening, or in casesof emergence, only once in two days, the camelwill continue uninterruptedly for five or sixdays : with these qualities, so suitable to barrenand sandy deserts, what a valuable gift of Providencewas this, especially to the descendants ofIshmael ; who, according to the prophecy,have maintained undisturbed possession of theirdeserts and their necessary accompaniment,* thecamel, from the time of their progenitor to thepresent day, a period of between three or fontthousand years. They have been wild men,always assailing and assailed, and yet maintainingtheir ground. But the time will assuredlycome, when The flocks of Cedars and the rams ofNebaiothy^ shall forsake their deeds of spoliationand robbery and be gathered to the church.Though the Ruminants, in general, by thestructure and division of their hoof, are calculatedfor sure footing, so as to enable them bestto exercise their several functions ; as the camel,the ox, and the rein-deer at the bidding of theirmaster man ; and others, as the chamois andthe goat, for the ascent of mountains and pre-psalIx. 7.PR£UENSORY ORGANS. 205cities, seemingly inaccessible, where they canlaugh at their pursuer ; and others again, as thedeer and antilope tribes for speed that almostmocks pursuit ; yet with respect to prehensionthese organs are of no use to them. Their mouthand lips, and tongue, are the only means bywhich they can help themselves to their food ;they have no tusks like the Pachyderms ingeneral, nor nasal horns like the rhinoceros, tocut or dig with ; but as their food is most commonlythe herbage that covers the earth, theseare fully sufficient to enable them to supplythemselves with Food convenient for them. Thecamel and dromedary differ from the otherRuminants, not only in their long neck, whichprobably is useful to them in gathering theirfood, but also in having a cleft lip, which doubtless,adds to the prehensory powers of thatorgan. The lofty neck is still more striking inthe Camdopard, the long tongue of which isalso used by them as a hand to pull down thebranches of the mimosa, from which they derivetheir subsistence.2. I sall now consider those Mammalians,whose legs are more or less prehensory, nextabove the Pachyderms and Ruminants. Cuvier'ssixth Order consists of a tribe of animalswhich he denominates Dentated because they«^ Tenth,200 LOCOMOTIVE ANDhave no fore teeth. The Manor ernes form thelast Family of the Order, and precede the Pachyderms.In many points they seem connectedwith the birds ; one genus ^ having a mouthresembling the bill of a duck, and being almostweb-footed ; it has also been stated to be oviparous;* the male, as I before observed,^ is armedwith a sting, like a serpent. The other genus,Echidna approaches nearer the pangolinsy^ andanteatersy^ having, like them, an extensile viscidtongue, by means of which they entrap anddevour the ants. The other animals of theOrder are remarkable for their great nail,almost approaching to hoofs; in the Familywhich precedes the Monotremes^ they are oftenused for burrowing.Next above the Echidna is a singular animal,wearing the outward aspect and scales of aSaurian, the pangolin, which rolls itself up likean armadillo, and is the ant-eater of the old world.It is singular that a real lizard, the chameleon,should have the same instinct of catching itsinsect prey by means of a long tongue besmearedwith slime. In the new world thepangolin is replaced by the ant-eaters, whichhave the same habits, and the same mode ofOmithorhynchus, * Cuv. R^gtie Anim. i. 234, note 2.See above p. 82. * Man's.Myrmecophaga, ^ Events ordinaire, Cuv.PREHENSORY ORGANS. 207procuring their food. With the long nails oftheir fore-feet they penetrate the nests of thewhite ants and common ants, and inserting theirlong tongue, besmeared with a viscid saliva, intothese nests, retract it covered with game ; andthis with such velocity, that the eye can scarcelyfollow them. Their nails, which require to bekept sharp, for the operation just mentioned,when not employed, are folded inwards, so as tomoment their being blunted. In one species inthe fore-foot there are only two nails.Amongst the animals that are clothed inannour, in this Order, the most remarkable isthe Chlamyphorus^ whose feet are armed withfive long and sharp nails, especially the anteriorones, which must enable it to excavate its subterraneanabode very rapidly. From the formationof its foot and these nails it does not appearto dig with them laterally, but in a line withthe body; its singular clubbed tail thereforewould be a very useful organ, if, as Mr. Darrellsupposes, it is used in removing backwards theloose earth accumulated under its belly by theaction of the fore-l^s.^ This animal, which is anative of Chili, is reputed to carry its youngbeneath the scaly armour attached principallyto the spine, which covers it loosely like a cloak.M, didactylas. * Plate XVI. * ZooL Joum, iii. 551.208 LOCOMOTIVE ANPThe last family, as we ascend, in the presentOrder, is very well distinguished by the nameof Tardigradesy from the excessive slowness oftheir motions. Their nails are enormously long,compressed, and crooked, and exactly calculatedfor laying strong hold, so as to enable them tomaintain their station on the trees, whose leavesand buds form their food. Their English appellation,the Sloth j^ indicates their character ; whenthey have satisfied their appetite, like most ofthe other Edentates, they can roll themselvesup and take a long and reckless sleep. But Ineed not enlarge further upon this tribe, sinceDr. Auckland has excellently — Justified the ivy$of God to many — and, in the present instance, demonstrated,by most convincing arguments, thatthese animals, instead of being an abortion, imperfect,misshapen, and monstrous, are exactly,and in every respect, adapted for the stationwhich God has assigned to them, and for thework which he has given them in charge.*Next above the Edentate Mammalians is anOrder, them of Cuvier, consisting of a greaternumber of Genera and Subgenera than anyother in the Class, which, instead of having nofront teeth or incisive, have very conspicuousones, rendered more so by being separated by aBradypus. * Linn. Trans, xvii. 17.PREH£NSORY ORGANS. 2011void Space from the grinders. From these teeth,which are neither calculated to seize or laceratetheir food, but merely to nibble and gnaw it,they have received their name of Nibblers orAnswers.'The great majority of this Order are gregarious,and live in burrows, or common habitations,which they excavate or fabricate themselves.Like the Hymenopterous Class ofinsects, many are noted for the sagacity andskill which they manifest in their united laboursfor the good of the community, and also for theorgans by which they are enabled to answer thbidding of instinct.One of the most remarkable of these is theBeaver;* this animal has five toes on all itsfeet, which in the hind pair are connected bymembrane ; those of the fore-leg, which it usesas a hand to convey its food to its mouth, arevery distinct. They carry also with these handsthe mud and stones which they mix with thewooden part of their buildings. But their incisorteeth are their principal instruments, with these,as Dr. Richardson states, they cut down trees asbig or bigger than a man's thigh ; when theyundertake this operation they gnaw it all round,cutting it sagaciously on one side higher thanon the other, by which it is caused to fall in theRodent ia. * Castor Fiber,VOL. II. P210 LOCOMOTIVE ANDdirection they wish; they use these powersorgans not only to fell the trees they select, butalso to drag them to the place where they whatthem. It is said, that a beaver, when at its fulstrength, can at one stroke bite through the legof a dog.It has been affirmed that beavers employtheir tail both as a trowel to plaster their houaeB^and as a sledge to carry the trees that theyfell ; but both these assertions seem to be builtupon conjecture rather than observation, andare not credited by those who have had the bestopportunities of observing their manners, asHeame, Cartwright, and Dr. Richardson. Thefaln-ics they are taught by their Creator to erect,and impelled by the instinct he has implanted inthem, are sufficiently wonderful without havingrecourse to fiction to exaggerate it. Their tail,probably, are useful to them in the water asnatatory organs.There is a very singular animal discovered byM. Sonnet, in Madagascar, called the Aye-ayeswhich seems, in some degree, to approachthe Quadrumanes. The fore-feet have five excessivelylong fingers, and what is singular, themiddle one is much slenderer than the rest. Inthe hind feet there is a thumb opposed to theother fingers, by which structure it is enabled toCheiromys,PREHENSORY ORGANS. 21 1take firmer hold of the branches of trees. It issaid to use the slender finger of its hand for thesame purpose that the wood-pecker uses itsbarbed tongue, to extract the grubs from thetrees.The squirrels, which form the first genus in thisinteresting Order, are known to use their forelegsfor prehension, which indeed is the casewith the majority of animals included in it.They are also, at least a large proportion, re-affable for sitting, when at rest, upon theirhaunches, and also for their ready use of theirfere-legs.Having before noticed the most remarkableanimal in Cuvier's^bierM Order, the MarsupianSywhich suckle their young in a pouch, I shallonly mention one other animal belonging to it,the Koaloy^ a New Holland quadruped, in somerespects resembling the bear ; like the chameleon,it has the five toes or fingers of the forefootdivided into two groups, the thumb andibid-finger forming one, and the three remainingfingers the other ; the object of this structure isevidently to enable it to take firm hold of thebranches of the trees on which it passes part oflis life ; this is of the more importance to it, asit carries its young upon its back. It punts.2 1 2 LOCOMOTIVE ANDtimes, probably in the night, retires to burrowswhich it excavates at the foot of the trees.We have now arrived at the foot of BaronCuvier's third Order, containing the prefacesMammalians, which, though a very comprehensivegroup, will not detain us long, as thefirst and last family, the Bats and Seals, havebeen noticed in another place.* The rest of theOrder consists of the insectivorous and carnivorousMammalians ; the latter is further subdividedinto two tribes, which are denominatedthe Plantigrades and the Digitigrades.Those last mentioned usually walk more upontheir toes, and consist of the feline, canine, andseveral other tribes, all swift in their locomotion,and making use of their paws or fore-foot,either for scratching and burrowing, or to seizetheir prey, and they have all, I believe, fivetoes.The Plantigrades are so called because theywalk, like man, upon the whole foot, and consistof the bears the glutton,' and similar animals.This structure enables the former to rear itselfon its hind feet, and walk erect ; and their forefootwill grasp a staff like a hand ; it is armedwith long claws, with which they scratch uprootswhich form part of their subsistence, exca-» See above, p. 137, 156. » Ursus. * Gulf,PR£H£NSORY ORGANS. 2 13sate burrows, climb the trees, and seize theirprey.These armed paws are fearful weapons, bothin the lion and the bear, to which few wouldEke to be exposed ; but an heroic youth, belovedof God and man, regarded them not when, asafaithful shepherd, he rescued a lamb of hisfather 8 flock from their grasp and voracity.The two most remarkable animals in theinsectivorous tribe of predaceous Mammalians arethe moles and the harmless, though persecutedhedgehog,* but they are both too well known,the former for its piquant, and the latter forits hand turned outwards and moved by anenormous apparatus of muscles, to enable it toexcavate its subterranean habitation.We are now arrived, in our progress upwards,at Cuvier second Order of Mammalianss,which he names Quadrumafiey or four-handed,and which consists of apes,' baboonsand monkeys,* whose hind as well as fore-footis usually furnished with a thumb opposite tothe fingers, so that they can use all their feet forprehension : the object of Providence by thisstructure is to enable these animals to moveabout amongst the branches of the trees, whichare their usual habitations, and to fix themselvesTala. « Erinaceus, •' Simia &c.♦ Cynocepkalus, &c, * Lemur, &c.214 LOCOMOTIVE ANDsecurely upon them, so that they can use theirhands to gather fruit or any other purpose.Thus also they can perambulate the trees withas much ease and safety as we do our houses;and run up and down the branches with asmuch celerity as we do our staircases : but theycannot make equal progress on the earth, or aplane surface, whether they go on four feet ortwo.Even man himself, though he ordinarily cannotuse his toes for prehension, yet is sometimesplaced in such circumstances, as to acquire thepower of doing so. I remember, when a boy,going to see a girl who was born without armsand was exhibited by her parents to the public.She could use her toes as fingers ; could holdscissors, cut out watch-papers, sew, and evenwrite. An account was given in the St. James'sChronicle, not long ago, of a youth similarlycircumstanced, who being cruelly turned out byhis father, but patronized by his sister, leanedto draw with his toes. In India they are usedas fingers, and are sometimes called foot-fingers.The Hindoo tailor twists his thread nth thai,and the cook holds his knife while he cuts fish,vegetables, &c., the join, weaver, and othermechanics all use them for a variety of purposes; and I am told by a friend, who has c&iOibeen in India, that they can even pick up pinswith them.Precentor Y ORGANS. 2 1 5We are now arrived at man himself, who, aswe flee, takes his particular denomination fromthe band. He is the only Inane.The physiology and anatomy of the HumanHand that wonderful organ, have been explainedand reasoned with great ability in aseparate treatise, by the eminent comparativeanatomist to whom that subject was assigned ; Ishall not, therefore, here say any thing on itsstructure and its uses : but as it has not beentreated of as a moral organ ; as being inintimate connection with the heart and affections;as their principal index and demonstrator; and as the mighty instrument by whicha great part of the physical good and evil whichbefits our race is wrought, I may be permittedto make a few observations upon it as far asthese are concerned.God made the body in general a fit machine,not only to execute the purposes of itsimmaterial inhabitant the soul; but, in someSort, he made it a mirror to reflect all its bearingsand character ; to indicate every motion ofthe fluctuating sea within, whether its surges liftthemselves on high elevated by the gusts ofpassion; or all is calm, and tranquil, and subdued.None of the bodily organs, by its structureand station in the body, is so evidentlyformed in all respects for these functions as theHand. The eye indeed is, perhaps, the most2 1 LOCOMOTIVE ANDfaithful mirror of the souls emotion ; yet thoughit may best portray and render visible the internalfeelings it can in no degree execute itsbidding ; but the hand is the great agent andminister of the soul which not only reveals herinmost affection and feeling, and, in conjunctionwith the tongue — and these two in connectionare either the most beneficent or maleficent ofall our organs — declares her will and purpose ;but is also employed by her to execute them.Thus Heart and Hand, the principle and thepractice, have been united in common parlance,from ancient ages. The earliest dawn of reasonin the innocent infant is shown by the signs itmakes with its little hands ; by them it preferits petitions for any thing it desires, and, inimitation of this, God's children are instructedto lift up holy hands in prayers Love, friendship,charity, and all the kindly affections of ournature, use the hands as their symbol and oi ;the fond embrace, the hearty shake, the liberalgift, are all ministered by them. Joy, gladi^esSi^applause, welcome, valediction, all use thesesorgans to represent them. Penitence smites herbreast with them ; resignation clasps them ; devotionand the love of God stretches iheaok oatto wards, heaven.But the hands are not employed to expMfl1 1 Tim. il I.PRfiHENSORY ORGANS. 217only the kindly affections of the soul. Those ofa contrary and less amiable character use themas their index. Anger threatens, and moreviolent and hateful passions destroy by them*They are indeed the instruments by which agreat portion of the evil, and mischief, andviolence, and misery, that our corrupt naturehas introduced into the world, are perpetrated.The hand also, on some occasions, becomesthe spokesman instead of the tongue. The forefingeris denominated the index because we useit to indicate to another any object to which wewish to direct his attention. By it the deaf anddumb person is enabled to hold converse witho&ers so as not to be totally cut off from theenjoyment of society ; and by it we can likewisemutually communicate our thoughts whenseparated by space however wide, even with ourAntipodes.ThB Deity himself, also, condescends to conveyspiritual benefits to his people by meansof the hands of authorized persons, as in Con*formation and Ordination ; and the BlessedFriend, and Patron, and Advocate and Delivererof our race, when he was upon earth,appears to have wrought most of his miracles ofhealing by laying on his hands ;^ in benedictionabo, when children were brought unto him he1 Mark, viii. 23—25.818 Locomotives ANDlaid his hands on them ; and at his ascenskmhe lifted up his hands to bless his disciplesTo enumerate all the modes by which the internalaffection of the soul is indicated by thehand would be an endless task. I shall thereforeonly further observe, that the greater part ofthe instances I have aadduced are natural, aadnot conventional or casual modes of expressingfeeling, as is evident from their being employed,with little variation, in all ages, nations, andstates of society.How grateful then ought we to be to ourCreator for enriching us with these admirableorgans, which more than any outward one thatwe possess, are the immediate instruments thatenable us to master the whole globe that weinhabit, not merely the visible and tangiblematter that we tread upon, and its furniture andpopulation, but even often to take hold as itwere of the invisible substances that float aroundit, and to bottle up the lightning and the wind,as well as the waters. Thus by their means dowe add daily increments to our knowledge andscience, and consequently power ; to our skill inarts and every allied manufacture and manipulation; to our comforts, pleasures, and everythingdesirable in life.If now — having arrived at the most perfect1 Mark, X. 16. Luke, xiv. 50.PREHENSORY ORGANS. 3l9ittrtramentt as to its uses, and the most im-^portant to the happiness and welfare of theHuman race,, whether it be considered as aninstrument of good or evil — we turn back andreview this long train of organs for every kind ofmotion, and every kind of operation, and considermoreover the animal to which each belongswith respect to its place and station, connection ,powers of multiplication, relative magnitude,form, composition, structure, functions, and atthe same time take into further consideration thetheatre upon which each is destined to appear,the medium in which it is to move and breathe,aad the beings, whether vegetable or animal,with which it is to come in contact, and uponwhich it is to act.When, I say, we take this review, what aninfinite diversity in every respect bewilders ourthought, and we are unable to form any distinctidea of the general effect and harmony that weknow to be produced, nor how all these instrumentsdovetail, as it were, so as to form thewhole into one great fabric or sphere of agents,all contributing to fulfil the purposes of the GreatBeis^ who fabricated it, and promoting thegeneral health and welfare of the whole system.But this we can understand that the Fabricatorof this sphere must have taken a simultaneoussurvey of all the circumstances here mentioned ;must have calculated the momentum of each220 INSTINCT.individual, have weighed and measured it, softestit should not exceed a certain standard ; musthave seen at once all that it wanted to fit it forits station ; must, before he made it, have formeda correct estimate of all the requisite materials,whether gaseous, aquiform, or solid, so as to puttogether the whole harmonious compages withoutfailing in a single atom ; and give fullaccomplishment to his will.He who could effect all this could only beone whose Understanding is infinite and whosePower and Goodness are equally without bounds.Chapter XviiOn InstinctsThere is no department of Zoological 'Sciencethat furnishes stronger proofs of the being andattributes of the Deity, than that which relatesto the Instincts of animals, and the more so,because where reason and intellect are mostpowerful and sufficient as guides, as in man,and most of the higher grades of animals, thereusually instinct is weakest and least wonderful,while, as we descend in the scale, we come totribes that exhibit, in an almost miraculousINSTINCT. 22 1maonar, the workings c^ a Divine Power, andpertain operations that the intellect and skill ofman would in vain attempt to rival or to imitate.Yet there is no question, concerning which theNatural Historian and Physiologist seems moreat a loss than when he is asked — what is Instinct?So much has been ably written upon thesubject, so many hypotheses have been broached,that it seems wonderful so thick a cloud shouldskill rest upon it. It must not be expected, whereso many eminent men have more or less failed,that one of less powers should be enabled tothrow much new light upon this palpable obscure,or dissipate all the darkness that envelopesthe secondary or intermediate cause of Instinct.Could even the bee or the ant tell us what it isthat goads them to their several labours, andinstructs them how to perform them, perhaps wemight still have much to learn before we shouldhave any right to cry with the Syracuse Mathematician,*Evpiffca, I have unveiled the mystery.Still, however unequal to the task, I cannot dulydischarge the duty incumbent upon me, whomay be said to be officially engaged to prove thegreat truths of Natural Religion from the Instinctof the animal creation, to leave the subject ofInstinct, considered in the abstract, exactly asI found it ; a field, in which whoever perambulates,may wander " in endless mazes lost."322 INSTINCT.I will, therefore, do my best to make the way,in a small degree, more level, and less intricate,than it has hitherto been.But, before I proceed, lest the reader shouldfeel disposed to accuse me of contradicting dieopinions on this subject stated in the Introductionto Entomology, I beg to direct his attention tothe following paragraph in the advertisement tothe third volume of that work. '^ It will not beamiss here to state, in order to obviate any changeof inconsistency in the possible event of Mr.Kirby's adverting in any other work to thissubject, that, though on every material point,the authors have agreed in opinion, ther theirsof the theory of Instinct do not precisely accord.That given in the second and fourth volumes isfrom the pen of Mr. Spence."It is not without considerable reluctance thatthe author of this essay takes the field, issome degree, against his worthy friend andlearned coadjutor, but as he is thus left at libertyto do it, and the nature of his subject requiresit, he will state those views, which seem tahimself most consistent with nature and troth,and most accordant with the general plan ofcreation. It is doubtful whether the ancientshad any distinct idea of that impulse upon animals,urging them necessarily to certain actions,which modern writers have denominated instinct*INSTINCT. 223Aristotle, indeed, in a passage of his physicsquoted by Bochart,^ alludes to certain writerswho doubted whether spiders, ants, and similaranimals were directed in their works by intellect,or by any other faculty. The Stagyrite himselfrescues the causes of motion into intellect andappetite,' bat I have not been able to discoverthat he has recorded any opinion as to what causethe, now called, instincts of animals, whetherto appetite or intellect, are to be attributed : hesays much on the subject of the hie bee, but itis merely a history of its proceedings, unaccompaniedby a single syllable from which wemight conjecture that he attributed any part ofthese proceedings, wonderful as he must havethought them, to any faculty distinct from intellect,and what seems more extraordinary, withoutany expression of admiration at the expertness,and art, and skill, so evident in all that this littlecreature almost miraculously accomplishes. Onanother occasion, indeed, he observes, that*' Some of the animals that have no blood, havea more intelligent soul than some of those thathove blood, as the bee and the ant genus. "^ Amuch later Greek writer has asked the question,^ Who taught the hee, that wise workman to actHierozoic, ii. 599, b.De anima, 1. iii. c. 11.^ De Part, AnifnaL 1. ii. c. 4.224 * INSTINCT.the geometer and to effect her three-started Ium$csofhexagofial structures ?"^ And this is the questionI shall now endeavour to answer.When we consider the infinite variety of in-stinctSy their nice and striking adaptation to thecircumstances, wants, and station of the severalanimals that are endowed with them, of whichnumerous instances will be given hereafter, wesee such evident marks of design, and suchvaried attention to so many particulars, such aconformity between the organs and instrumentsof each animal, and the work it has to do, thatwe cannot hesitate a moment to ascribe it tosome power who planned the machine with aview to accomplish a certain purpose, and whenwe further consider that all the different animalscombine to fulfil one great end, and to effect avast purpose, all the details of which the humanintellect cannot embrace, we are led further toacknowledge that the whole was planned andexecuted by a Being whose essence is unfathomable,and whose power is irresistible.I must here previously observe, that in consideringthis mysterious subject, we must avoid, asmuch as possible, building our theories uponfacts which, if properly interpreted, are extractTtiv fuXiTTay, rtfv tro^tfy rtjv tpyarivTewfitrpeiv eviitn, Rai rpcdifio^ttcOiK&c eyeipeiy t^ayovitfy KTiafiarwv,Pisidius, D# Mundi Officio, quoted by Chart.INSTINCT. 225nefas to the subject, and wear such an aspect ofdie marvellous as to appear out of the regularcourse of nature, and the ordinary proceedingsto which its instinct urges any animal. Thecases here alluded to, if true, to the full extentof the statements concerning them, would ratherindicate a particular interposition of DivineProvidence, either to prevent some calamity, orto produce some blessing or benefit to the individualsconcerned. Thus the account of Sir H.Lee's dog, mentioned by Mr. French whichsaved its master's life, by taking and maintainingits station, which it had never before done, underhis bed ; and that given by Dr. Battle, of a dog,who, when his master was in a situation of themost imminent peril, after fruitlessly attemptingto save him, ran to a neighbouring village, andby significant gestures at last prevailed upon aman to follow him, and saved his master's life.These and many more such cases, can scarcelyfoe regarded as belonging to the ordinary instinctof the species, for if it did, more murderers wouldbe disappointed of their intended victim by theagency of his or her dog. I knew myself aninstance, in which a most valuable life was savedby a dc, which, being condemned to the halterby a former master, and escaping from thoseZooL Joum. i. 7.VOL II. Q226 INSTINCT,appointed to dispatch him at last establishedhimself, after repeated expulsion > in my friend'sfamily, and afterwards, there is every reason tobelieve, by the sacrifice of his own life, preventedhis master from being dr<>wned.^ These casesare remarkable, but they do not appear tobelong to instinct, but rather to the doctrine ofa particular Providence.Some cases upon record, with respect to dogsand other animals, belong to intellect and memoryrather than instinct. M. Bureau de laMotte, in a memoir on the influence of domesticityin animals, mentions a dog, which beingshut out, would use the knocker of the door;*and I had myself a cat, which indicated itswish to come in or go out, by endeavouringwith its fore paws to move the handle of thedoor-latch of the apartment ; and need everymorning to call me by making the same indicationat the door of my bed-room : other catshave attempted to ring the bell. But the mostremarkable instance, is one related, by the writjust named, of a very intelligent dog, which wasemployed to carry letters between two gentlemen,and never failed punctually to execute hiscommission — first delivering the letter, whichwas fastened to his collar, and then going to thekitchen to be fed. After this, he went to theAnnal des Sb. NatureL xxi. « Ibid, 52.INSTINCT, 227parlour window, and barked, to tell the gentlemanhe was ready to carry back the answer.*The remarkable case of the ass Valiantly andof other animals that find their way to their oldquarters from a great distance, may be attributedI think, rather to natural sagacity and memory,than to any instinctive impulse. The animaljust alluded to might have sagacity enough tokeep near the sea, or a concurrence of accidentalcircumstances might befriend her.Divine Providence has at its disposal thewh<de animal creation, and can employ all theirinstincts and their faculties to bring about its ownpurposes, both with respect to individuals andmankind in general. Man, who may be called,under God, the king of the visible creation,makes a similar use of the creatures that areplaced at his disposal ; of some, as the horse andthe ox, he employs the physical powers; ofothers, as the bee and the dog, he avails himselfof the instinct. Some he instructs how they areto do his work ; others, he takes as he finds them.So the Deity, it may be presumed, with a secrethand, guides some to fulfill his will, instructingthem, as it were, because their unaided instinctwould not alone avail, in the decree they are toexecute, while others, merely by following thebent of their nature, do the same. In manyAnnal. des Sc. Naturel. 66.^ Introdd. to Ent. ii. 496, Note a.238 INSTINCT.cases, also, he may he supposed merely to directthem to the field in which he means they shouldlabour, and then leave them to their instincts toaccomplish his purposes. In the case of thodog who saved his master from intended assassination,a supernatural impulse might carryhim to his chamber and cause him to maintainhis station there, and when the hour of dangerarrived, his natural instinct would suffice sotthe defence and liberation of his master fromthe threatened danger.When we consider the work that animals haveto do in this globe of ours, each, in a particulardepartment, and to a certain extent, it seemsabsolutely necessary that, on many occasions,the interference of a Supreme Power should takeplace, to say to each, ^* Hitherto shcdt thou comand no further'' and only an Omnipresent Being,infinite in power, wisdom, and goodness, couldcheck the further progress of any body of hisworkmen when he foresaw it would be noxious,exceed his intentions, and derange his plans.** Nee Deus intermit, nisi dignus venice nodusIntegrity* *was the dictum of a poet, who had as muchjudgment, and good sense, as he had genius;and it is only where ordinary means are evidentlyinsufficient to account for any fact, thatwe are at liberty to ascribe it to the extraordinaryinterposition of the Deity ; or to any intermediateINSTINCT. 229supernatural agency employed by him to produceit: and no class of facts so loudly proclaimtheir Great Author as those which areAe result of the nice balancing of conflictingenemies and operations observable in the differentdepartments of the animal kingdom.We may observe, however, that when ourSaviour says to his disciples concerning sparrows— One of them shall not fall to the groundwithout your Father. But the very hairs of yourhead are all numbered ; ' — the observation impliesthat nothing escapes the notice, or is too mean,or insignificant, to be below the attention andcare of Him who is all eye, all ear, all intellect ;who directed all things to answer his purposes,according to the good pleasure of his tvillf* whichis the universal good of his creatures.Having premised these general observations,I shall now proceed to inquire into the proximatecause of instinct; admitting, as proved,that every kind of instinct has its origin in thewill of the Deity, and that the animal exhibitingit, was expressly organized by Him for it at itscreation.The proximate cause of instinct must be eithermetaphysical or physical, or a compound of bothcharacters.1. If metaphysical it must either be the tm-1 Match. X. 29, 30. < Ephes. i. 5.230 INSTINCT*mediate action of the Deity, or the action ofsome intermediate intelligence employed by lmn»or the intellect of the animal exhibiting it2. If physical, it must be the action or stimulusof some physical power or agent employed bythe Deity, and under his guidance, so as to workHis will upon the organization of the animal,which must be so constructed as to respond tothat action in a certain way ; or by the exhibitionof certain phenomena peculiar to the individualgenus or species.3« If compound or mixed it will be subjectoccasionally to variations from the general law,when the intelligent agent sees fit.•1 . With respect to there* Hypothesis, one ofthe principal promulgators and patrons of which1^ Addison it nearly amounts to this, as thatamiable writer confesses, that '* God is the soulof brutes." It is contrary, however, to thegeneral plan of Divine Providence, which usuallyproduces effects indirectly, and by the interventionand action of means or secondary causesto suppose that it acts immediately upon insectsmind other animals, and is so intimately connectedwith them as to direct their instinctiveoperations ; such an action, it should seem,would be infallible, aud never at fault, whereasSee Spectator, H. p. 121.JJJSTINCT. 231observation has proved that animals are sometimesmistaken, where their instinct shoulddirect them. For, if God were their immediateinstructor, would it be possible for the flesh-fly,ad I have seen that she does, to mistake theblossom of the carrion-plant* for a piece of flesh,and lay her eggs in it ; or for a hen to sit upona prince of chalk, as they are stated to do,* insteadof an egg? Still all instincts are fromGod, He decreed them, and organized animalsto act according to that decree, and employedmeans to impel them to do so.Other arguments might be adduced provingthat this Hypothesis does not rest upon a soundfoundation ; but as I shall hereafter advert tosome of these, I shall now proceed to considerwhether instinct be the action of some intermediateintelligence, employed by the Deity,upon the animal exhibiting it.An ingenious and acute writer, Mr. French,is the author of this Hypothesis, which appearedin the first number of the Zoological JournaLHe infers, "That the Divine Energy does inreality act, not immediately but mediately orthrough the medium of moral and intellectualinfluences, upon the nature or consciousness ofthe creature, in the production of the various,and in many instances, truly wonderful actions^ Stapclia hirsuta, ^ Spectator, ii. n. 120.232 INSTINCT.which they perform ; that brute are goi^emddby such agencies, good and evil but under thecontrol of Providence; and that such agenciesact by impressions upon their conscious nature,but unperceived by it in a moral or intellectualsense." ^ He thus opens the way to his theory.'* If it be asked by what intermediate agencythe operations of brutes are thus directed ;— Ireply that it is generally admitted by a largeclass of mankind, at least, that superior (yetintermediate) powers of some kind, are in actualconnection with the human mind.*^^From the passages here quoted, it seemsevident (though the author declares that he willnot even '' venture a suggestion as to the natureof the superior powers here alluded to,")^ thathe had in his mind those good and evil intelligencesthat are generally acknowledged to bein actual connection with the human mind ; or,to use the common phraseology. Angels and Demons.The former being the cause of the beneficentand the latter of the ferocious instincts ofanimals.When he further observes — "Upon theseprinciples the mixed natures of some animalsare satisfactorily explained ; — as in the instanceoi the Phoca ursina^ the males of which speciesmanifest the most singular tenderness towards1 Zool Jour. i. 5, 6. « Ibid. « Ibid. 6,INSTINCT* 233theirs young progeny ; and, at the same time, asavage and persecuting disposition towards theirfinnales."^From this passage it would seem that theauthor was of opinion that the same animal wassubject to the agency both of good and evilintermediate intelligences, the one producing itsaffection, and the other its ferocity.When our Saviour denominates serpents andscorpions the power of the eiumy^ it may perhapsbe thought that he affords some countenanceto this opinion, especially as the evilspirit actually made use of the serpent, as hisoi^n and instrument, when he accomplishedthe fatal lapse of our first parents from theoriginal rectitude of their nature. But, if wepay due attention to the context, we shall findthat, in this passage, as often in other parts ofscripture, the symbol is put for the thing sym-indited.^' I beheld Satan as lightning j fallfrom Heavens' says our Lord. " Behold I giveunto you power to tread on serpents and scotiaons and upon all the power of the enemy. -^Nevertheless in this rejoice fit that the spiritsare subject to your's The treading thereforeon serpents and scorpions was treading upon thespirits of which they were figures.If we duly reflect upon the incongruity of aniZooL Jaurn. i. 7. « Luke, x. 19. « /^, 18—20.234 INSTINCT.angel and a demon influencing the same animalin so far as it exhibits instincts partly benevolentand partly ferocious, we shall be convinced thatthis hypothesis, pursued to all its consequences,cannot stand. Intermediate agents between theDeity and the brute are as much in the place ofa soul to the latter, as the Supreme Intelligencewould be if his action upon them were immediate,so that the same irrational animal wouldbe alternately a machine impelled by a good orevil intelligence. According to this hypothesisthe bee, that symbol of wisdom, when she setsout upon her beneficent errand of collectinghoney and pollen, is acted upon by the goodangel; but, if she meets with any thing thatexcites her fear or her anger, she is stimulatedto take vengeance upon the object of her displeasure,and to make him feel the puncture ofher poisoned dart, by the evil one.This can never be admitted. The same objectiontoo lies against this hypothesis as againstthe last, that it does not account for the mistakessometimes made by the animal when endeavoursing to accomplish its instinct. It cannot besupposed that, in the case before mentioned, theintelligent intermediate agent would stimulatethe flesh-fly to deposit her eggs upon the blossomsof the carrion plant, where the young mustinevitably perish from hunger, instead of uponreal flesh.INSTINCT. 235I am next to consider whether instinct betheresult of the intellectual powers of theanimal itself that exhibits it. If we surveythe different tribes of the animal kingdom,we shall find a vast difference between themwith respect to intellect. That wonderful pulp,which of all substances is alone able to respondto incorporeal agq^cy : to receive and storeup the information collected by the organs ofsensation, that it may be ready for future useand which is the seat of the intellectual faculties,that wonderful pulp appears under very differentcircumstances in the different Classes ofanimals ; but it has not been made evident thatthe acuteness of the intellect, though in someinstances it seems to do sos depends altogetherupon the comparative volume of the brain ; forthat of the mouse, compared with its size, isgreater than that of the half-reasoning elephant'Man indeed, generally speaking, has the largestbrain of all animals, but it seems a singularanomaly that persons of very weak intellectshave often disproportionately large heads, indicatinga great volume of brain. When we leavethe vertebrate animals, we find the nervous^ The brain of the elephant is Bve times the size of that of therhinoceros being as 182 to 35.

Cotnp. ii. 148.236 INSTINCT.system, in most, materially altered and degraded,so that more power is given apparentlyto instinct and less to intellect. In other animals,as we descend, the nervous system becomesmore and more dispersed, so that in thoseat the foot of the scale we discern no traces <^intellect, and very few of instinct ; and only somuch apparent sensation as is necessary for thepurposes of nutrition and reproduction. I havemade the above observations because they bearin some degree on the question now before ns.For if we pay due attention to the proceedings ofanimals, we shall find that those whose nervoussystem is cerebral usually exhibit the moststriking proofs of intellectual action, are mostcapable of instruction, and are less remarkablefor the complexity and intenseness of their instincts; while those of the next grade, whosenervous system is ganglionic, as far as we knowthem, though not devoid of intellect, are enduedwith a much smaller portion of it, while theirinstinctive operations are all but miraculous, andthat where the nervous system is still less concentratedboth are greatly weakened, till at thebottom of the scale they almost disappear.From hence it seems to follow that extraordinaryinstinctive powers are not the result ofextraordinary intellectual ones.But when we reflect further, that even incases where the instincts are most complex andINSTINCT. 237wonderful, the animal practises them infalliblywithout guide or direction, and is as expert atthem when it first emerges into life, as when ithas been long engaged in the practice of them ;it follows that it must be instructed in themfrom the first moment of its existence in thestate in which it exercises them, by an infallibleteacher. The bee, the moment it emerges fromthe pupa, begins to collect honey and pollen,and to perform all the other manipulations thatbelong to her instincts.In the higher animals the case is somewhatdifferent. When they emerge into life, fromthe womb, or from the egg, it is usually in astate of helplessness, in which at first they cando little or nothing for themselves but suck, orreceive food from, their dam. As their organizationdeveloped they gradually gain new powers,till they arrive at their acme, or age of puberty.The young beaver generally remains with itsparents till it is three years old, when theycouple, and build a cabin for themselves andoffspring. The unfledged bird remains quietlyin its nest, and is content to receive its food andwarmth from its parents, but no sooner are itsfeathers grown, and its beaked prow and plumyoars and rudder fit it to win its way, in theocean of air, than, incited by parental exhortationsit makes the attempt, and henceforth isequal to support itself, and to fulfill the bidding238 INSTINCT.of instinct as well as of intellect and appetite.This store stimulates the parent animal whileits care of its young is necessary to them andthen ceases. This is therefore chiefly instiltime ; but in the most intellectual of all animals,where instinctive love ceases, rational love begins; and care and anxiety for the welfare ofoar offspring, and affectionate regard for theirpersons, continues after they cease to have anyneed of our help and attention.It is not always easy in this tribe of animalsto distinguish those actions that are purely instinctivefrom those that are not so, and writerson this subject, as was before observed, oftenascribe to instinct actions that are produced byother causes. Animals of the higher grades, bymeans of their oi^ans of sensation, acquire ideasripon which they in some sort reason, by comparingone with another; thus they get experience,and as they grow older literally growwiser. Hence we see old ones often verycunning and expert in removing obstacles, findingtheir way, and the like.With regard to truly instinctive actions, theyinvariably follow the development of the organization; are neither the result of instruction,nor of observation and experience, but the actionof some external agency upon the organization,which is fitted by the Omniscient Creator torespond to its action.INSTINCT* 239Indeed » if intellect was the sole fountain ofthose operations usually denominated instinctive,animals, though they sought the same end,would vary more or less in the path they severallytook to arrive at it; they would . requiresome instruction and practice before they couldbe perfect in their operations; the new bornbee would not immediately be able to rear a cell,nor know where to go for the materials, till someoneof riper experience had directed her. Butexperience and observation have nothing to dowith her proceedings. She feels an indomitableappetite which compels her to take her flightfrom the hive when the state of the atmosphereis favourable to her purpose. Her oi^ans ofsight — ^which though not gifted with any powerof motion, are so situated as to enable her to seewhatever passes above, below, and on each sideof her — enable her to avoid any obstacles, and tothread her devious way through the numerousand intertwining branches of shrubs and flowers ;some other sense directs her to those which containthe precious articles she is in quest of.Bat though her senses guide her in her flight,and indicate to her where she may mostprofitably exercise her talent, they must thenkidd her to the impulse and direction ofher instincts, which this happy and industriouslittle creature plies with indefatigable diligenceand energy, till having completed her240 INSTINCT.lading of nectar and ambrosia, she returns to thecommon habitation of her people, with whomshe unites in labours before described for thegeneral benefit of the community to which shebelongs.More reasons might be adduced to prove thatintellect is not the great principle of instinct, butenough seems to have been said to establishthat point. It should be borne in mind, however,that though intellect is not the great principle,yet it must be admitted that all animals giftedwith the ordinary organs of sensation, more orless employ their intellect in the whole routineof their instinctive operations, as I shall showunder another head.2. But if no metaphysical power can be satisfactorilydemonstrated to be the immediate causeof instinct, then it seems to follow that it mustbe either a physical one, or one partly physicaland partly metaphysical.In the former case, it must be the action ofsome physical power or agent, employed by theDeity, and under his guidance so as to work hiswill, upon the organization of the animal ; whichmust be so constructed as to respond to thataction in a certain way, or by the exhibition ofcertain phenomena peculiar to the individualgenus or species.i See above, p. 187, and Introdd. to EnU ii. 173.INSTINCT. 241Mr. Addison has observed — " There is not, inmy opinion, any thing more mysterious in naturethan this instinct in animals, which thusrises above reason, and falls infinitely short ofit. It cannot be accounted for by any propertiesin matter, and at the same time works after soodd a manner, that one cannot think it thefaculty of an intelligent being. For my ownpart, I look upon it as upon the principle ofGravitation in bodies, which is not to be explainedby any known qualities inherent in thebodies themselves, nor from any laws of mechanism,but according to the best notions ofthe greatest philosophers, is an immediate impressionfrom the First Mover, and the DivineEnergy acting in the creatures"*I have quoted this passage not as if Addisonintended to patronize the hypothesis now beforeme, but to refer to his illustration of instinct bycomparing it with Gravity. If Gravity be theresult of physical agency, and not an immediateimpression of the First Mover, so may Instinctbe likewise. Reasoning from analogy it seemsinconsistent with the customary method of theDivine proceedings with regard to man, and thisvisible system of which he is the most importantpart — for a being that combines in himselfmatter and spirit, must be more important thanSpectator, ii. n. 120.VOL.

E. T. 11. 337. 341.INSTINCT. 243I says if we duly consider what these powersactually effect, it will require no great stretch offaith to believe that they may be the inter-agentsby which the Deity acts upon animal organizationsand structures to produce all their variedinstincts.An eminent French zoologist has illustratedthe change of instincts resulting from the modificationof the nervous system, which takesplace in a butterfly , in the transit to its perfector imago state from the caterpillar by a noveland striking simile. He compares the animalto a portable or hand organ , in which, on acylinder that can be made to revolve, severaltunes are noted ; turn the cylinder and the tuneibr which it is set is played ; draw it out a notchand it gives a second ; and so you may go ontill the whole number of tunes noted on it havehad their turn. This, happily enough, representsthe chai which appears to take place in thevertebral chord and its ganglions on the metamorphosisof the caterpillar into the butterfly,and the sequence of new instincts which result£pom the change. But if we extend the comparison,we may illustrate by it the two spheres oforganized beings that we find on our globe, andtheir several instinctive changes and operations.We may suppose each kingdom of nature to beDr. Vires.244 . INSTINCT.represented by a separate cylinder, havingnoted upon it as many tunes as there are speciesdiffering in their respective instincts— for plantsmay be regarded, in some sense, as having theirinstincts as well as animals — and that the eon*stand impulse of an invisible agent causes eachcylinder to play in a certain order all the tunesnoted upon it : this will represent, not unaptly,what takes place, with regard to the developmentof instincts, in the vegetable and animalkingdoms ; and our simile will terminate in theenquiry, whose may be that invisible hand thatthus shakes the sistrum of Isis,^ and producesthat universal harmony of action, resulting fromthat due intermixture of concords and discords,according to the will of its Almighty Author, inthat infinitely diversified and ever moving sphereof beings which we call natureWhat, if the powers lately mentioned, andwhich, in the Introduction to the present work,I hope I have made it appear, are synonymouswith the physical Cherubim of the Holy Scriptures,or the heavens in action which under Godgovern the universe ; what, if these power—employed as they are by the Deity so universallyto effect his Almighty will in the upholding ofthe worlds in their stated motions, and prevent-theSistrum of Isis symbolized the elements.2 Ovffcc tcayaioKr},INSTINCT. 245log their aberrations, — should also be the intermediateagents, which by their action on plantsand animals produce every physical developmentand instinctive operation, unless whereGod himself decrees a departure that circumstancesmay. render necessary from any lawthat he has established ?With regard to the vegetable kingdom, consistingof organized beings without sense orvoluntary motion, few would deny that they aresubject to the dominion of the elements, andrespond to the action of those mysterious powersthat rule, under God, in nature. But when thequery is concerning the animal kingdom, mostof the members of which to organization and lifeadd a will and powers of voluntary motion, andmany have a degree of intelligence residingwithin them which governs many of their actions,ve hesitate as to the answer we shall return to it.It will furnish a presumptive proof that thoseactions which are instinctive in animals are theresults of the action of those intermediate powersto which I have just alluded, if it can be shewn,that there is any thing in plants at all analogousto the instincts of animals, for if there be, onecan scarcely suppose that they are producedby a different cause. Let us, therefore, nowleaving the animal kingdom, — which to usperhaps appears the sole theatre in which in-sticks manifest themselves, — and turning our246 INSTINCT.attention to the vegetable, inquire whether anythinganalogous to these springs of action isdiscoverable there.One remarkable distinction, between the animaland the vegetable is in the difference of theprinciples that form their pabulum. The formerdoes not become the nutriment of the latter tillit is chemically decomposed ; whereas the latterbecomes the food of the former, either in itsgreen, or ripe state, and is not decomposed andturned to nutriment till it is passed into itsstomach, and is subject to various actions ofvarious organs, or their products, so that, thoughthe food of both is decomposed in order to beassimilated, yet with regard to the vegetablethis happens before it enters it, but to the animalafter it enters it, the decomposing powers beingwithout the plant and within the animal. Inthe former case it is the action of the atmosphereunassisted by the organization of the plant— inthe latter it is the same action assisted by theorganization of the animal.Another thing may be here observed — that asthe most remarkable instincts of animals arethose connected with the propagation of thespecies, so the analogue of these instincts inplants is the development of these parts peculiarlyconnected with the production of the seed—so that the expanded flower and the operationINSTINCT. 247going on in it is the analogue of the reproducetime instinct of the animal : this is all producedby physical action upon the organization of theplant. Now if we consider the infinite varietyof plants, and the wonderful diversity of theirparts of fructification, and that these are allproduced in their several seasons and stationsby the action of some physical powers upontheir varied organization, and by means of thesoil in which they are planted, we shall thinkit nearly as wonderful and unaccountable as theinstinctive operations of the various creaturesthat feed upon them. That the same actionshould unfold such an infinite variety of formsin one case and instincts in the other is equallyastounding and equally difficult to explain. —Compare the sunflower and the hive-bee, thecompound flowers of the one, and the aggregateof combs of the other — the receptacle with itsseeds, and the combs with the grubs.Again, as all plants have their appropriatefructification, so they have other peculiaritiesconnected with their situation, nutriment, andmode of life, corresponding in some measurewith these instincts that belong to other parts ofan animal's economy. Some with a climbing orvoluble stem, constantly turn one way, and someas constantly turn another. Thus the hoptwines from the left to the right, while the bindsINSTINCT.weed goes from right to left ; ^ others close theirleaves in the night, and seem to go to sleep;others shew a remarkable degree of irritabilitywhen touched; the blossoms of many, as thesunflower, follow the sun from his rising to hissetting; some blossoms shut up, as in theanemone, till the sun shines upon them ; othersclose at a certain hour of the day, as the goatsbeard;^ another, Hedysarum gyrans^ slowly revolves.The same physical action upon a peculiarorganization produces all these effects.We may further observe that the great majorityof plants send forth radicles which presentingtheir points to the sources of vegetable life andnutrition on all sides, absorb each its portion,and convey it to the stem from which theyissue ; analogous, in this respect, to the polypes,which unfold and expand their tentacles for asimilar purpose. Ivy planted against a wall ortrunk of a tree supports itself by innumerableradicles, but I once saw a plant reared as astandard which sent forth none. This seemsanalogous to some animal instincts, which, dependingupon circumstances, may be calledconditional; as when, in the case of a sterilequeen, the bees do not, as usual, massacre thedronesSee Will. Principe. of Botany, § 18. n. 51. a. A. Plate il.Tragopogon. ' Introdd. to EnL ii. Lett. xx.INSTINCT. 249There is another parallelism between the plantand the animal, especially the insect, whichappears to prove that their instincts are ruled bythe same physical agent, I mean their alternation.In extra tropical countries, or a greatproportion of them, as the year declines, and theamount of heat, received from its great fountain,is diminished by the shortening of the days, thedeciduous times and shrubs cast their leaves,plants of every description cease more or lesstheir growth, and all vegetable nature seems tobecome torpid. At the same period, and underthe influence of the same cause, the decrease ofthe amount of caloric, several of the higher animals,all the reptiles, as well as nearly the wholeworld of insects, retire from the exercise of theirwonted instincts, and conceal themselves, someunder the earth, and others under bark, understones, in crevices, moss, and similar hidingplaces, where they take their winter's sleep, tilla more genial temperature whispers to them —Awake — and they return to their several employments.This effect in both the plant and theanimal, seems to spring from the same physicalcause — the periodical lowering of the tempo*ratnre ; so that heat appears to be the plectrum,and the organization of the animal, the stringsit touches, which cause it to exhibit the prescribedsequence of its instincts. Whoever hasbeen in the habit of attending to the motions of250 INSTINCT.insects will find them most alert in sultry deaths,especially in an electric state of the atmospherebefore a thunder storm. Heat and electricityalso accelerate the growth o{ plants, if duly Suppliedwith moisture.It is remarkable, and worthy of particularobservation 9 verifying the old adage that extremesmeet, that an approach towards the maximumof heat produces sometimes the same effectsupon organized nature that an approach towardsthe minimum does. In tropical countries theydo not divide the year into winter and summer,but into the rainy and dry seasons ; as to temperature,the former would, perhaps, be judged tocorrespond with our winter, and the latter withour summer, but with respect to the state ofanimals and vegetables, the reverse would appearto be most consistent with facts. Thegreat rains, according to M. Lacordaire,' " beginto fall in Brazil about the middle of September,when all nature seems to awake from its periodicalrepose ; vegetation resumes a more livelytint, and the greater part of plants renew theirleaves ; the insects begin to reappear : in Octoberthe rains are rather more frequent, andwith them the insects ; but it is not till towardsthe middle of November, when the rainy seasonis definitively set in, that all the families a^iear> AnnaL desk, Nature. xx. Juin. 1830. 193.INSTINCT. 251suddenly to developed themselves; andgeneral impulse that all nature seems to receivecontinues augmenting till the middle of January,when it attains its acme. The forests presentthen an aspect of movement and life of whichour woods in Europe can give no idea. Duringpart of the day we hear a vast and uninterruptedbum, in which the deafening cry of the tree-hopperprevails ; and you cannot take a step, ortouch a leaf, without putting insects to flight.At 11 a. m. the heat is become insupportable,and all animated nature becomes torpid — thenoise diminishes — the insects, and other animalsdisappear — and are seen no more till the evening*Then, when the atmosphere is again cool, to thematin species succeed others whose office it is toembellish the nights of the torrid zone. I amspeaking of the glow-worms and fire-flies;'whilst the former, issuing by myriads from theirretreats, overspread the plants and shrubs ; thelatter crossing each other in all directions, weavein the air, as it were, a luminous web, the lightof which they diminish or augment at pleasure.This brilliant illumination only ceases when thenight gives place to the day.As during our winters, some part of the insectp<^ukttion occasionally appear and dance in thesunbeam, so in Brazil, according to M.

With regard to all actions, in thelatter, which are the result of intellect, they, ofcoarse, are produced by some principle residingvitbin, as when the senses guide it, or it exercisesits memory ; and these aid it in followingthe impulse of instinct. The greatest of modernchemists has observed, with respect to somesuch agent, '' that the immediate connectionbetween the sentient principle and the bodymay be established by kinds of etherial matter,which can never be evident to the senses, andwhich may bear the same relation to heat, light,aad electricity, that these refined forms or modesof existence bear to the gases." ^ I may observeupon this passage, that the farther any matter isremoved from our knowledge and coercion, themore powerful it really is. Thus liquids aremore powerful than solids, gases than liquids,imponderable fluids than gases, and so we mayConsolations in Travel , 214.254 INSTINCT.keep ascending till we approach the confines ofspirit, which will lead us to the foot of the throneof the Deity himself, the Spirit of spirits, theonly Almighty, the only All-wise, and the onlyAll-good.Dr. Henry More, a very eminent philosopherand divine of the seventeenth century, under thename of the Spirit of Nature, speaks of a powerbetween matter and spirit, which he describesas — '' A substance incorporeal, but without senseand animadversion, pervading the whole matterof the universe, and exercising a practical powertherein, according to the sundry predispositionsand occasions in the parts it works upon, raisingsuch phenomena in the world, by directing theparts of matter and their motion, as cannot beresolved into mere mechanical powers — ^whichgoes through and assists all corporeal beings,and is the vicarious power of God npoa theuniversal matter of the world. This suggests tothe spider the fancy of spinning and weavingher web ; and to the bee of the framing of herhoney-comb ; and especially to the silk-worm ofconglomerate her both funeral and natal chie ;and to the birds of building their nests, and oftheir so diligent hatching their eggs."^This Spirit of Nature of Dr. More seems notvery different from the Etherial Matter of SirOn the immortality of the Saul, B. iii. c. 12, 13.INSTINCT. 255H. Day ; and it is singular, that Dr. Paris, inkis interesting life of our great chemist — speakingof a monument to be erected to his memoryat Penzance — should thus express himself. '' Itwas to be erected on one of those elevated spotsof silence and solitude where he delighted, inhis boyish days, to commune with the elementsaod where the Spirit of Native moulded hisgenius in one of her wildest moods. "^But — to return from this digression to Sir H.Davy's etherial matter bearing the same relationto heat, light, and electricity, that they do to thegases — I would ask, if such may be the powersby which the soul moves the body, and producesthose actions that are in our own power to do ornot to do, depending upon the will, does it seemincongruous that light, heat, and air, or anymodification of them, upon which every animaldepends for life and breath, and nutrition andgrowth, and all things, should be employed bythe Deity to excite and direct them, where theirintellect cannot, in their instinctive operations?That their organization, as to their instrumentsof manducation, motion, manipulation, &c. has aInference to their instincts every one owns ; canwe not, therefore, conceive that the organizationof the brain and nervous system may be sovaried and formed by the Creator, as to respond »> Life of Sir H. Davy, 4to» edit. 61 7.256 INSTINCT.in the way that he wills, to pulses upon themfrom the physical powers of nature ; so as toexcite animals to certain operations for whichthey were evidently constructed, in a way analogousto the excitement of appetite ? The newbornbabe has no other teacher to tell it that itsmother's breast will supply it with its propernutriment ; it cries for it ; it spontaneously appliesits mouth to it ; and presses it under thebidding of appetite resulting from its organization.When it arrives at the age of dentition,it as naturally uses its teeth for mastication ; itwants no instructor to inform it how they are tobe employed to effect that purpose ; and so withrespect to other appetites which the furtherdevelopment of its organs produces.It may, perhaps, be urged, in the case latelyalluded to, of the infant growing up to puberty,that the instinctive operations that take placeunder the bidding of appetite fall under thegeneral law of instinct ; but it must be admittedthat the gradual development of the organizationis the consequence of the action of physicalpowers in the processes going on in thebody. Or, as a learned writer on the subjectasks, — " In effect is instinct any thing else, butthe manifestation without of that same wisdomwhich directs, in the interior of our body, all ourvital functions."^1 Dr. Vires. AT. D. D'Hist. Nut, xvi. 293.INSTINCT. 267Having rendered it probable that those instincts,which result evidently from what arecalled bodily appetites, are the consequencesmerely of physical action upon an organizationadapted to respond to it, I shall next inquirewhether this may not be the case in instanceswhich are not to be regarded in that light.We may divide instincts into three generalbeads : —a. Those relating to the multiplication of thespecies, especially the care of animals for theiryoung both before and after birth./3. Those relating to their food.y. Those relating to their Liberation.a. The pairing of animals usually begins totake place in the spring, when the winter ispassed, the earth is covered with verdure andadorned by the various flowers that now expandtheir blossoms, in proportion as the great centreof light and heat more and more manifests hispower over the earth ; the birds sing theirlove^songs; the nightingale is now— '« Mostmusical, most melancholy ;" — the cuckoo repeatshis monotonous note; and every other animalseems to partake of the universal joy. All thisappears the result of a physical rather than ametaphysical excitement.As to their care of their future progeny, agreat variety of circumstances take place. VividII. s358 iNSTmcT.paros animals have generally to give sock totheir young for a time ; oviparous (mes either toconstruct a nest to receive their ^gs» and, afterhatching, to provide them with appropriate foodduring a certain period, or to deposit their eggswhere their young progeny, as soon as hatched,may infallibly find it. But first, I must saysomething of that Stores or instinctive affection,which is almost universally exhibited by femalesfor their progeny both before and after parturition;a feeling of affection not generallycommon to the males, or rather only in a fewinstances, as where the male bird assists thefemale in incubation. Yet this instinctive fondness,as soon as it ceases to be necessary,vanishes ; except, as was before observed,^ in thehuman species ; a fact that seems to prove thatit is not the result of the association of ideas,but of an impress of the Creator interwoven withthe frame. But that this impress is by meansof a physical interment, seems to fellow fromthis circumstance — that the hen shows the sameinstinctive attachment to the young dwellingsthat have been hatched under her, that shewould do to chickens, the produce of her iowaeggs; ^i^d if the new-born offspring c£ anymammiferous animal is abstracted from her, andanother substituted, even of a different kind,1 See above, p. 238.INSTINCT. 269the same affectionate tenderness is manifestedtowards it, as its own real offspring would hayeexperienced. Now was it a metaphysical, andnot a physical, impulse, surely this would not bethecase. This is only one of many instances,which prove that instinct is not infallible : and,in truth, with regard to the higher animals, manyassociations may take place between the childaad parent that help to endear the former to thelatter. In the first place, the very circumstanceof its being the fruit of her own bowels andfed with milk from her own breast must bindit to her by the tenderest of ties ; especially as,at the same time, it relieves her from what istroublesome. There is something also in infanthelplessness, and infant gambols, calculated towin upon the doting mother. The subsequentalienation and estrangement of the female fromher young, which takes place in all animalsexcept man, appears, in the first instance, to beproduced by their becoming troublesome andannoying to her; which, in some degree, mayaccount for her desire to cast them off. Examiningthe subject, therefore, on all sides, in thehighest grades of animals, and those in whommtemal affection appears most intense, intellectand associations may be a good deal mixed withinstinct in producing it. As we descend in thescale, the intensity of the feeling seems muchreduced; and, in numerous tribes, is confined260 INSTINCT.solely to the circumstances of parturition. Sothat the Stores and its cessation, do not appearaltogether so extraordinary and unaccountableas a cursory view might tend to persuade us.The MammaUa7is^ in general, appear, to haverecourse to very few striking preparatory actionspreviously to bringing forth their young, sincethey have usually no nest to prepare for theirreception. Cats, however, it may be observed,search about very inquisitively for a snugand concealed station ; and burrowing animalsnaturally retire to the bottom of their burrows,when their feelings tell them their hour is come,and there are relieved of their precious burthen.Several others of the Prudentia, or answers, asthe dormouse, make beds of their own hair toreceive their young. In most cases that fallunder our daily observation, the young aredropped where the mother happens to be whenthe pains of labour overtake her. The animalswe are speaking of have at hand immediately aplentiful supply of food for the nutriment oftheir new-born offspring; they have not, likethe birds, to search for provision for them, but,«from their own bodies, furnish them with adelicious fluid suited to their state, which, fortistheir support till they are able to crop and digestthe herbage, when they are left to shift forthemselves. Some are born more independentof maternal care than others ; thusINSTINCT. 201animate, as the cal£ the Iamb, and the younge<rft, can move about almost as soon as they areborn, and can immediately use their organs ofsight; whereas the progeny of beasts of preywally come into the world blind, and sometimeelapses before they can run about, so thatthe dam, if she wishes to remove them, mustcarry them herself, which she generally does, inher mouth.As the proper food of herbivorous quadrupedsis almost every where abundant, they are soontempted, without the intervention of the mother,to browse upon the herbage : but the predaceousbeast whose food must be pursued andcaptured, takes more pains to instruct herycmng how to maintain themselves; thus thecat lays the mouse or bird, that she has caught,before her kittens; and it is laughable toobserve how they are excited, and with whatresolution and ferocity the little furies endeavourto keep possession of the prey their dam. hasbrought to them.But of all classes of animals the birds are themost remarkable for the labours they undergopreparatory to laying their eggs. In those thatmigrate a long aerial voyage is previously to beundertaken, the stimulus to which, in the swallow,spears to be altogether physical and isVol. 1. p. 102. See Jenner, Philos, Trans. 1824, 20.362 INSTINCT*probably so in other migratory. But what is itthat directs them in their flight, and enablesthem to return to the countries from whichth had migrated ? Did the swallow ^ steer hercourse within sight of land, it might, perhaps,be supposed that her memory was her director :but these birds are often found at sea, hundredsof miles fh>m any shores where, one wouldthink, there could be no index either in theclouds or the ocean to instruct her which way tosteer her adventurous course. The only atmosphericphenomenon affecting her would be thechange of temperature as she went northward.But we can only conjecture in this case— oba^^Nation, as well as scripture, tells us, indeed,The stark in the heaven knoweth her appointedtimes; and the turtle and the cranes and disallowobserve the time of their comings but,God, who decrees the end, appoints the me^ms^which often remain amongst his Secret Things.Yet, though the immediate agent that guidesthe swallow over the expanse of water, from thetorrid to the temperate zone is latent, we maystill inquire, when she has made the shores ofBritain, what is it that urges her to seek her oldvicinity, and to build her nest in the very spotwhere she herself first drew breath, as Dr. Jenner'sexperiments prove that swallows dol1 Hirundo rustica. ^ P kilos. Trans, ubi Supr. 13.^ Jersm, vii 7. ^ Pkilos. Trans, ubi supr. 16.Instinct.siHere may we not conjecture that her intellectand memory become her guides? She recognizesthe spot in which she committed herselfto the sea breeze; and there probably, againflies inland, and will have no great difficulty inpnrsuii)^ the line of country which leads to hernative village, and to the very roof under theeaves of which she was born.But of all the instincts of the feathered partof the creation, there is none more remarkablemore varied, and more worthy of admirationthan that which directs them in the situationand structure of their nests. — One nidificatesupon the ground ;^ another under ground, or inthe sand ;^ some select the chimney or eaves ofhouses for their clay-built structures thosegelatinous nests, which the Chinese epicuresand orators so highly prize, are formed incares and dark places by the little bird whosework they are. The great nugority, however,nidificate in trees and bushes, and where theyare within reach their nests are carefully concealed.The structure and materials of nests are alsoinfinitely various, and may be considered toresult, as well as aU the proceedings of animalswith regal to their young, from an excitementanalogous to that which Dr. Jenner first noticed1 Motacilla Troglodytes. < Hirundo riparia.3 H. ruBtka et urlnca, ^ H. escuUnia.264 INSTINCT.in the swallows upon which he observesThe economy of the animal seems to be regulatedby some external impulse which leads toa train of consequences/'^ and which does notcease its action till it has accomplished the sidfor which it was given ; namely, the procreation ;opposition preceded by nidifi cation ; incubation;hatching, or birth ; nutrition and education ofthe young progeny of each individual kind,according to the general law of the Creator.We know very little of the proceedings of theremaining Classes of Vertebrates — which aredistinguished by having cold blood — the Reptiles^^namely, and the Fishes ; except that theydo not feel that instinctive love for their young,after birth, exhibited by the quadrupeds andbirds. They, however, are invariably instructedby the Creator to select a proper place in whichto deposit their eggs where they can be hatchedeither by artificial or solar heat. Those of someOphidianSj as snakes, are buried in sand, andnot seldom even in heaps of fermenting manure;while those of venomous ones are hatched in thewomb of the dan, and come forth in the serpentineform. The Saurians also select a properplace for their eggs, and then desert them ;the crocodile buries hers in the sands near theriver ; where many, however, are devoured byPhilos. Trans. 1824. 20. * IM. 25.INSTINCT. 265the ichneumon, and its other enemies, and areeven relished by man. In the Batrachian Orderone species of salamander commits a single eggto a leaf of the Persicaria which it protects bycarefully doubling the leaf, and then, proceedingto another, repeats the same manoeuvre, till herovipoMtion is finished : * the toads and frogs laytheir eggs in the water, the former producingtwo long strings resembling necklaces, formed,as it were, of beads of jet, inclosed in crystal ;while those of the latter consist of irregularmasses of similar beads. This gelatinous ortransparent envelope forms the first nutrimentof the embryo. The nuptial song of the Reptilesis not, like that of birds, the delight of everyheart, but is rath^ calculated to disturb andhorrify than to still the soul. The hiss of ser-^penes; the croaking of frogs and toads; themotioning of turtles ; the bellowing of crocodilesami alligators,' form their gamut of discords.With regard to the Class of Fishes the generalobject of those that migrate appears to be thecasting of their spawn ; this it is that causes thedifferent species of the salmon genus to leave thesea for the rivers; for this the herring travelssouthward, and the fnackarel seeks the north;1^ of them guided by the law of the Most High,shewing itself by an indomitable instinct, to1 Salamandra plate Cauda*» Edith; Phil.

Fromthe instance of the flesh-fly, above related,' welearn that it is their scent that directs insects toa proper station for their eggs. When we recollectthat every plant, almost, is the destinedfood of some peculiar insect, we may conjecturethat the sense of smelling must, in them, be &rmore nice than in the higher animals, so as toenable them to distinguish from all others theappropriate nutriment of their own descendents.Where the parent, as is sometimes the casefeeds upon the same plant with the childrafi^See Vol. I. p. 107. < See above, p. 231.INSTINCT. 267she reqniroB do such guide, but with respect tothe majority of insects especially the infiniteboat of Lepidoptera, — which, after they arriveat their perfect state, never touch what formstheir nutriment while they are larves, — somesuch guide is absolutely necessary.^. Another Class of Instincts relates to thedifferent modes by which animals procure their/4»d. Nothing affords a more striking proof ofCreative Wisdom, and of the most wonderfuladaptation of means to. an end, than the diversitiesof structure with a view to this particularfunction. If we consider the infinite variety ofsubstances, animal and vegetable, produced fix>mthe earth, which form the nutriment of its inhabitants— some solid and not easily penetrable ;others soft and readily severed and comminuted ;others again fluid, or semi-fluid ; — we may conceivewhat a vast diversity of organs is necessaryto effect this purpose. To render solid food, ofany kind, fit for deglutition and digestion, thesame mouth must be furnished with severalkinds of teeth some for incision, others forlaceration, others again for grinding and mastication— while those that only absorb liquidsmexeky require an organ adapted for suction,though often, at the same time, fitted to pierce thesubstance from which the nutritive fluid is to bederived. How various, also, must be the organs268 INSTINCT.for swallowing, and digesting the food accordingto its nature; others for elaborating it, andabstracting from it all those substances that aierequired by the several systems at work in thebody, and conveying them to their proper stations; and the means also for rejecting from thebody the residuum after the government for theabove purposes of the finer life-supporting products.Here are a variety of organs, admirablein their structure, and fitted for action in aninfinity of ways ; some at the bidding of the willstimulated by the appetite ; others independentof the will, such are the distillations, perforations,chemical and electrical processes, con-^instantly going on in the body of every animal,to separate all the products that its nature andfunctions require, all speak of a mechanicalagency at work within, not independent in itsoperation, but fulfilling a law which must beobeyed It has been found that Galvanic actionwill supply the place of the till upon the nervesand muscles, for by it the eyes can be opened,and other muscular movements be produced inadead body.* Sir H. Davy was of opinion thatthe air inspired carries with it into the blood asubtile or ethereal part probably producinganimal heat, since those animals that possess1 See Dr. Rogers excellent statements on these subjects,B.

Providence has spread atable before them, and invites them to partakeof it, without any other trouble, than bendingtheir necks to eat it ; but the carnivorous ones,as their destined pabulum is endued withlocomotive powers, which enable it often toescape from them, and disappoint their expecthave recourse to stratagems, andlie in wait for their prey ; these, however, consistchiefly in concealing themselves and springingsuddenly upon it. The fox, of all quadrupeds,is the most celebrated for his stratagems andfinesse in entrapping his game, and his patienceis equal to his craft. Some have doubtedwhether this animal can fascinate poultry, ashas been often asserted, but I know one instancewhich fully confirms it. A friend ofmine one night hearing a noise, upon lookingoat in its direction, saw a fox under the hen-roost,peering up at the hens, which both heand his wife, who told me the story, saw, as theydid also the fox running away, in spite of theirshouting, with one in his mouth. Indeed, on1 Consolations in Travel, 196, 197.270 INSTINCT.any other principle we cannot account for hisdepopulating the hen-roosts in the night.The birds are less noted, than even the quadrupeds,for their stratagems, or any remarkablemeans of providing food for themselves or tbciryoung. Those of prey boldly attack and sometheir destined food wherever they find it; theowls, indeed, like the cats, their analogues,seem to use artifice as much as strength toattract the mice. The carrion-feeders, as thevultures and crows, soon discover the carcasesof dead animals Some of the sea-birds, especiallythe gulls, indicate the approach of badweather, by leaving the coast, and seeking theinterior; and, during the intense frosts of asevere winter, the web-footed birds and waders,quitting their summer stations in the morenorthern regions, fly to the south and seek theunfrozen springs and waters of the inland districts,where th find a supply of food. Allthese physical actions seem to arise from a physicalcause, and easily to be accounted for, withouthaving recourse to any other.With regard to the cold-blooded animals, thefishes and reptiles, we know but little of theirhabits in this respect, ot of any particularstratagems to which they have recourse to procuretheir food. Some of the predaceous fishesas the pike and perch, appear to lie-in wait in1 Rogct, B. T. \\. 407.INSTINCT. 271deep water, and eo dart upon their prey ; others,as the shark, with open mouth pursue and devourthem ; the fly-catching ones, as the severalspecies of the carp and salmon genus areequally upon the watch, but nearer the surface,to B&ze a may-fly* or ephemera; the fishingsfrog' hangs out its lines in the sea to catchother fishes ; the serpents are said to fascinatedie birds ; the enormous boa lies in wait for theantelopes and other quadrupeds, and coilingitself round them in mighty folds, crushes themto render them more fit For deglutition ; theBatrachians, Chelonians, and numerous Sauriansare on the alert after insects and small game ;while the vast and ferocious crocodiles and alligators,looking like trunks of trees, lie baskingnear the sur£eu;e of the water, ready to springupon any large fish, or even man, that mayfrance to come within reach.Of all animals, insects afford the most numerusinstances of instinctive proceedings withthis sole end in view ; the pitfalls of the ant-lion;^ the webs and nets of the various sorts ofspiders spread over the face of nature; andmany more, furnish instances of stratagems tosecure their daily food; while an infinity ofothers acquire it, aided only by their senses andBtttoral weapons. Let any one look at the prosCyprinus and Salmo. * Phryganea,Lophius. * Myrmeleon.272 INSTINCT.eminent eyes tremendous jaws, and legs andwings formed for rapid motion on the earth or inthe air of the tiger-beetles and he will readilysee that they want no other aid to enable themto seize their less gifted prey: and numerousother tribes both on the earth and in the wateremulate them in these respects. The pacific otherbivorous insects also are mostly fitted withan extraordinary acuteness of certain senses todirect them to their appropriate pabulum. Thesight of the butterfly and moth invariably leadsthem to the flowers, to suck whose nectartheir cultivate tubes are given them. Thescent of the dung-beetles and the carrion-fliesallures them to their respective useful, thoughdisgusting, repasts. A very numerous tribe ofthose that derive their nutriment from otheranimals, neither entrap them by stratagem, norassail them by violence; but, as the butterflyand the moth deposit their eggs upon theirappropriate vegetable, so do these upon theirappropriate ammal food. Every bird almostthat darts through the air, every beast thatwalks the earth, every fish that swims in itswaters, and almost all the lower animals, andeven^man himself, the lord of all, are infested inthis way.Upon the food of the Crustaceans, MolhMaMjand all the lower grades of animals, I hare^ Cicindela.INSTINCT. 273before sufficiently enlarged ; I need not, therefore,here resume the subject.Thus we see the Almighty and All-wise manifestshis goodness as well as his wisdom andpower, in providing for the wants of all thecreatures that he has made; fitting each withpeculiar organs adapted to its assigned kind offood, both for procuring it, preparing it, digest-^ing it, assimilating it, and for rejecting theresiduum of all these operations. A physicalaction upon each of these organs and systems,fitted by him to receive and respond to it, is allthat the case seems to require in the majority ofinstances : in those, however, that depend uponartifice and stratagem for their food, the excitingcause is less obvious* These, indeed, belong tothe higher instincts considered under the Jirsthead.Y« That class of Instincts which relates to thehjfbematian of animals having been consideredin another places I shall only observe here, thatthe action of a physical cause is in no departmentof the history of animals more evidentlymade out.My learned friend and coadjutor, Mr. Spence,has in the Introduction to Entomology producedseveral facts, as not easily reconcilableto the hypothesis with respect to the cause of1 See above, p. 248.VOL. II. T274 INSTINCT.Instinct which I am now considering ; and probablya great many more might be brought forward; but my object here is mwely to considerthe general principle ; it would, indeed, be needlessand endless to discuss particular cases, andfully to account for all aberrations, which, in thepresent state of our knowledge, it would notbe possible to do.But there is one circumstance of a less confinednature, and upon which a good deal of thequestion hinges, to which it will be proper toadvert. I mean the change that has been observedin the nervous system of some insects intheir passage from one state to another. It iscontended that this change has nothing to dowith any alterations that then take place in theirinstincts, but only with those in their organs ofsense or motions In confirmation of this opinionit is further affirmed, that in three whole Ordo,*the structure of the nervous chord is not altered,and yet they acquire new instincts.But though no change has been noticed totake place in the number of ganglions of theseOrders, there must necessarily be a developmentin those that render nerves to the wingsand reproductive organs ; so that, though someganglions may not become confluent, as inthe Lqindoptera^ yet the range of their nerves« Introdd, to Ent. iv. 27, 28.« Viz. Orthoptera, Hemiptera, and Neuroptera.INSTINCT, 27618 increased. In this respect, they are inmuch the same situation with the higheranimals, though their nervous system, as to itsorganization, undergoes no material change, yetfrom the period of their birth, it is graduallymore and more developed till they arrive at theage of puberty, when new appetites are expelrenewed and new powers acquired, not by but by physical action upon theirseveral systems. In the three Orders referredto by Mr. Spence, there is not that differencebetween the different states of the insects thatcompose the majority of them, that there isbetween those whose pupes are not locomotive.The larves of the locust, for instance, are statedto emigrate, as well as the perfect insect, andliTe upon the same food ; the only differenceis in the locomotive and reproductive powers ofthe latter, both of which, as I have just saidmust be connected with some change in theirnervous system, operated gradually by a phy-fsical agent*From what has been stated, with respect tothese several classes of instincts, it appears, that,as far as can be judged from circumstancesthey have their beginning in consequence ofthe action of an intermediate physical causeupon the organization of the animal, which carrvainly renders it extremely probable that suchis the general proximate cause of the phenomena276 INSTINCT,in question. I-would, however, by no means,be understood to assert this dogmatically, butmerely that it appears to me the most probablehypothesis, and most consistent with the analogyof the Divine proceedings in this globe of ours,as well as with his general government of theheavenly bodies ; and though I have mentionedheat, electricity, and other elements as concernedin the production of these phenomena,yet I do not assert that other physical principlesmay not be commissioned to have a share in it.This field is open both to the speculation andexperimenter; they may each assist the otherin traversing and exploring it, and the wellknown adage. Dies diem docety be verified moreand more by their united efforts.Some may still feel disposed to ask, — Is itwithin the sphere of probability, or even possibility,that by the mere action of physicalpowers, however subtile, upon the brain andnerves of an animal there should be producedsuch a wonderful sequence of actions, and manipulationsas we know to be exhibited by thebeaver y the hee the spider and the ant ? Actionsconfessedly above the range of their intellect*But to this I would answer, we know that withGod all things are possible that do not imply acontradiction; and His Wisdom, Power, andGoodness, may be as evidently, an moreevidently, manifested, by the infinite varietiesInstinct. 277in the organization necessary to excite theappetite for such and such instinctive employmentsand operations ; and to stimulate animalsalways to run the same prescribed routine ofaction from day to day, and year to year ; thanif be did it by his own immediate action uponthem, or that of his ministering or others saints.When we examine a time-piece contrived bya skilful artist, containing within it variouswheels and other movements, all acted upon byone main spring or pendulum ; by means ofwhich, influencing all, seconds, minutes, andhours are indicated as they pass; and thelatter are struck successively, and repeated ifrequired : we admire the work, but more theart and hand that contrived and executed it;but our admiration would be much diminishedif, instead of these effects being produced bythe action of a main spring or pendulum uponits organization, if I may so call it, it wasnecessary that the maker of the machine, orone of his operatives, should always be presentto move the hands or strike the hours. So itseems most to magnify the Power and Wisdomof the Creator, if we suppose him to act byphysical means in all cases above the intellectof the animal. If he governs the physical universeby such means, is it much to suppose,that by the same he moves a bird or a bee, togloHiy him by their admirable instincts ? Where278 INSTINCT.action is indeed from the Deity upon spirit, asupon the soul of man, in a certain sense, it isby spirit; either immediately as by the Holyspirit ; or mediately as by an angelic nature ;but below spirit, it is surely most consonant toevery thing that we see and know, that it shouldbe by an agent below spirit.3. I am now arrived at the last suppositionor hypothesis — that the cause instinct may becompound or mixed — in some respects physical,in others metaphysical. In this case it will besubject occasionally to variations from the generallaw when the intelligent agent sees fit.But upon this head I shall not be very long,and I only introduce it here, to shew that theDeity sometimes dispenses with the general lawof instinct, or permits it occasionally to be interferedwith by the will of the animal, or otheragency. All animals that exercise instinctiveoperations, have in their several oi^ns of sensation,certain guides given to enable them tofulfil those instincts so as to bring about thepurposes of Providence.Sight, hearing, scent, taste, touch, perception,influence the will, and direct each animal to thepoints in which its instinctive actions are tocommence; and so far instinct is, as it we,mixed with intellect. I have seen it somewhereobserved — that instinct in conjunction with aINSTINCT. 279principle of limitation, — the intellectual faculties—rules the actions of all sentient and organisedbeings; just as gravity with the principle ofcounteraction — repulsion — determines the placeand composition of all inorganic bodies.With regard to the Deity, he retains in hishands the power of suspending or altering theaction of the laws that have received his sane*tion; and permits other metaphysical essencesto do the same. When females overcome thatstore or instinctive love for their offspring,either from the dread of shame, or worse motives,and destroy them, in common parlance, we saythat they were tempted by an evil spirit to committhe crime. Mr. Bennet, in his interestingWanderings in New South Wales, ^c, relatesthat it is common for the females of the aboriginaltribes, if they experience much sufferingin their labour, to threaten the life of the poorinfant, which when born they barbarously destroysThis is a fearful counteraction of instinctflowing from an evil source.The Deity himself, doubtless when there isdignus venice nodus — sometimes suspends theaction of an instinct. It is related in the HolyScripture, that when the ark of God was takenby the Philistines, in order to ascertain whetherthe plagues that were sent upon them were from1 I. 122.280 INSTINCT.God, they yoked two milch kine that had calvesto the cart in which it was sent to Bethshemesh^and the kine went straight to that place theirinstinct being mastered by a strong hand, thoughthey went lowing after their calves all the way.'Here the Deity ruled the instinct God interfereswith the instincts of animals also when heprescribes their course and sends them in anyparticular direction to answer his purpose : as inthe case of the prophet Jonah .^ Properly speaking,those interpositions of the Deity by whichthe law of instinct is suspended, to answer aparticular purpose of his Providence, like thatjust related, must be regarded as miraculous ;but yet, though unrecorded, they may happenoftener than we are aware in the course of hismoral government ; sometimes perhaps also toremedy some physical evil. This appeared thereforea proper place to advert to them.1 1 Sam, vu 7. 12. « Vol. I. p. 263.Chapter XIX.Functions and Instincts. Arachnidan^ Pseudoand Cardan Condylapes.Having wandered long enough, perhaps too long,in a wide and mazy field, but fertile everywherein proofs of the Power, Wisdom, and Goodnessof the Creator, it is time to return to the highroadfrom which we diverged.The Class of animals which led me into thisdigression were the Myriapods, concerning whichI observed, when I commenced my account ofthem, that on quitting the Crustaceans, the wayseemed to branch off from the long-tailed Decaypods by them, and from the short-tailed onesby the Arachnidans. We are now then to givea history of the latter Class.LatreiDe, in which he has been followed bymost modem Arachnologists, in his work in aidof Cuvier last edition of the Rhgne Animalsdivides his Arachnidans into two Orders, or those that breathe by gills, andTreacheries, or those that breathe by spiracles inconnection with trachea. In his latest wofk,^Le$ Crustacea, les ArachnideSf et les Insectes,Caurs D'Entomologie,282 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.which he did not live to finish, he added a thirdOrder, including some parasites, infesting marineanimals, such as the whale louse These, fromtheir having no apparent respiratory apparatus,he named, Aporobranchians.As the pulmonary Arachnidans of Latreilledifier from the Treacheries, &c., not only inhaving their body divided into two sections, butlikewise both in their respiratory organs andthose of circulation, I have always regardedthem as forming a distinct Class.'The following characters distinguish thisClass :Body covered by a coriaceous or homy integument,divided into two segments.

Araneidans, or spiders.No animals fall more universally under ob*sensation than the spiders ; we see them everywherefabricating their snares or lying in waitfor their prey, in our houses, in the fields onthe trees, shrubs, flowers, grass, and in the earth ;and, if we watch their proceedings, we maysometimes see them, without the aid of wingsascend into the air, where, carried by their webas by an air-balloon, they can elevate themselvesto a great height. The webs they spin andweave are also equally dispersed; they oftenfill the air, so as to be troublesome to us, andcover the earth. M. Mend Trigozo^ relatesthat at Lisbon, on the 6th of November, 18 U^the Tagus was covered, for more than half anhour, by these webs, and that innumerablespiders accompanied them which swam on thesifffoce of the water.

Theseteats are connected with internal reservoirswhich yield the fluid matter forming the threador web. These reservoirs in some speciesconsist o{/ouf\ and in others of six vessels foldedseveral times, and communicating with othovessels in which the material that forma theirweb is first elaborated.'Mammals, Inirod. to Ent. iii. 391. * Ftu», ibid. 392."" Latr. Ckmrs Dent. i. 496.ARACHNIDANS« 285Such are the organs which furnish the materialof those wonderful and diversified toilswhich the spiders weave to entrap the animalsthat form their food.The threads, after they issue from theseorgans, are united, or kept separate, accordingto the will or wants of the animal ; and it isstated, that from them certain spiders can spinthree kinds of silks Their ordinary thread isso fine, that it would require twenty-four unitedto equal the thickness of that of the silkworm.These threads, fine as they are, will bear,without breaking, a weight sextuple that of thespider that spins them-they employ their web,generally, for three different purposes ; in theconstruction of their snares, of their own habitations,and of a cocoon to contain their eggs.Spiders were divided by the older Arach-colonists, after Lister, into families according tothe mode in which they entrap or seize theirprey. More modern writers* on the subject,have taken their respiratory organs as regulatingthe primary division of the Order : upon this{mnciple, the spiders are formed into two tribesthose that have two pairs of gills ;' and thosethat have only one pairs M. Walckenaer, who» Blackwall, in Linn. Trans, xvi. 479.L. Du Four. Latreille.Tgtreqmeunumes. Latr. Theraphasa, &c. Walk.Dipneumones, Latr. Aranea.

Hunters wandering incessantly to entraptheir prey,2. Vagrants f watching their prey, concealedor inclosed in a nest, but often runningwith agility.3. Sedentaries^ forming a web in which theyremain immoveable*.4. Swimmers, swimming in the water to catchtheir prey, and there forming a web.To the first tribe, those, namely, with ftmrgills, some spiders belong, the instincts of whichare very remarkable. One of the largest, andmost celebrated, is the bird*spider.^ It formsthe tube which it inhabits of a white silk likemuslin, which it fixes amongst leaves, and inany cavities, and there watches its prey ; it isaccused by some of destroying even birds, whenceits name, especially the humming-birds butthis rests upon questionable authority ; andwriters are not agreed as to its general habits.Probably several species are confounded underMy gale aincularia. ' Trochilus.ARACBNIDANS* 287the flame name* I shall not therefore enlargefurther on its history ; I mention it merely aftthe largest spider known.The proceedings of those called the trap-doorspiders' are better authenticated, as those of themason-spider by the Abbe Sauvages and thoseof another species very recently, in the annalsof the French Entomological Society, by M. V,Audoin, one of the most eminent of modementomologists, under the name of the pioneer ,*^of his interesting memoir, I shall here give abrief abstract.Some species of spiders, M. Audoin remarks,are gifted with a particular talent for building :they hollow out dens ; they bore galleries ; theyelevate vaults; they build, as it were, subterraneanbridges : they construct also entrances totheir habitations, and adapt doors to them, whichwant nothing but bolts, for without any exaggeration,they work upon a hinge, and arefitted to a frame.*The interior of these habitations, he continues,is not less remarkable for the extreme neatnesswhich reigns there; whatever be the humidityof the soil in which they are constructed, waternever penetrates them ; the walls are nicelyCteniza, • Ct. Sauvages, ' Ct. bodies.The French word is feyure, which I cannot find in thedictionaries, bwt it means, the circular frame of the mouth of thetube which receives the door.988 FUNCTIONS AMP INSTINCTS.covered with a tapestry of silk, having usu^tythe lustre of satin, and almost always of adazzling whiteness. He mentions only fourspecies of the genus as at present known. Ooewhich was found in the Island of Naxos ;- anotherin Jamaica f a third in Montpellier ;' and afourth, that which is the subject of his Memoir,in Corsica ; to which I may add a fifth speiQieg,found frequently by Mr. Bennett, in differentparts of New South Wales.*The habitations of the species in questionare found in an argillaceous kind . of red earth,in which they bore tubes about three inches indepth, and ten lines in width. The walls ofthese tubes are not left just as they are bored,but they are covered with a kind of mortar,sufficiently solid to be easily separated from themass that surrounds it. If the tube is dividedlongitudinally, besides this rough cast, it appearsto be covered with a coat of fine mortar, whichis as smooth and regular as if a trowel had beenpassed over it ; this coat is very thin, and soft tothe touch ; but before this adroit workman lajfsit, she covers the coarser earthy plaster-workwith some coarse web, upon which she glues hersilken tapestry.All this shews that she was directed in her> Cteniza arian. * Ct, nidulans. ' C/. ccemeiUdna,Wanderings m N. S. Wales y ^c. u 328.ARACHNIDANS. 289work by a Wise Master; but the door thatcloses her apartment is still more remarkablein its structure. If her well was always leftopen, she would be subject to the intrusion ofguests that would not, at all times, be welcomeor safe; Providence, therefore, has instructedher to fabricate a very secure trap-door, whichcloses the mouth of it. To judge of this door byits outward appearance, we should think it wasfanned of a mass of earth coarsely worked, andcovered internally by a solid web ; which wouldappear sufficiently wonderful for an animal thatseems to have no special organ for constructing it :but if it is divided vertically, it will be found anmch more complicated fabric than its outwardaspect indicates, for it is formed of more thanthirty alternate layers of earth and web, embodied,as it were, in each other, like a set ofweights for small scales.If these layers of web are examined, it willbe seen that they all terminate in the hinge, sothat the greater the volume of the door, themore powerful is the hinge. The frame in whichthe tube terminates above, and to which the door18 adapted, is thick, and its thickness arises fromthe number of layers of which it consists, andwhich seem to correspond with those of thedoor; hence, the formation of the door, theht^e, and the frame, seem to be a simultaneousoperation; except that in fabricatingVOL. II. u290 FUNCTIONS Into INSTINCTS.the first, the animal has to knead the earth, aswell as to spin the layers of web. By thisadmirable arrangement, these parts always correspondwith each other, and the strength of thehinge, and the thickness of the frame, willalways be proportioned to the weight of thedoor.The more carefully we study the arrangementof these parts, the more perfect does the workappear. If we examine the circular margin ofthe door, we shall find that it slopes inwards sothat it is not a transverse section of a cylinder,but of a cone, and on the other side, that theframe slopes outwards, so that the door exactlyapplies to it. By this structure, when the dooris closed, the tube is not distinguishable fromthe rest of the soil, and this appears to be thereason that the door is formed with earth.Besides, by this structure also, the animal canmore readily open and shut the door ; by its conicalshape it is much lighter than it would havebeen if cylindrical, and so more easily opened,and by its external inequalities, and mixture ofweb, the eider can more easily lay hold of it withits claws. Whether she enters her tube or goesout, the door will shut of itsdf. This was provedby experiment, for though resistance, more orless, was experienced when it was opened, whenleft to itself, it always fell down, and closed theaperture. The advantage of this structure toARACHNIDANS. 291the spider is evident, for whether it darts outupon its prey, or retreats from an enemy, it isnot delayed by having to shut its door.The interior surface of this cover to its tubeis not rough and uneven like its exterior, butperfectly smooth and even, like the walls of thetube, being covered with a coating of white silk,bnt much more firm, and resembling parchment,and remarkable for a series of minute orificesplaced in the side opposed to the hinge, andarranged in a semicircle ; there are about thirtyof these orifices, the object of which, M. Audoinconjectures, is to enable the animal to hold herdoor down, in any case of emergency, againstexternal force, by the insertion of her claws intosome of them.The principal instruments by which thislittle animal performs her various operations,are her mandibles or cheliceres, and her spinners.The former, besides the two rows of tubercles,between which, when unemployed, her claw, orsting, is folded, has at the apex, on their innerside a number of strong spines As no one hasever seen her at work upon her habitation, itcannot be known exactly how these organs, and^ Plats XI. b.

In this species the trap-door is semicircular,having a sloping margin ; it is lined,as well as the upper part of the tube, with astrong close web, resembling parchment. I candetect in it no series of orifices, but I see hereand there little holes where the claws appearto have been inserted. This door is entirelyformed of layers of web, without any intermixtureof earth.Mr. Bennett, in his Wanderings ^.* givessome interesting particulars of the species discoveredby him in New South Wales. Hedescribes the tube, as about an inch in diameterat the mouth, and the lid as formed of webincorporated with earth, and exactly fitting themouth of the tube, in this resembling the pioneer.He heard of a person who used to amuse himselfwith feeding one of these insects: when itsmeal was finished, it would re-enter its habitation,and pull down the lid with one of itsPlate XL b. Fio. 4. « i. 328.ARACHNIDANS. 293claws. He further observes, that to discovertheir habitations when the lid is down; from itsbeing so accurately fitted to the aperture, wasvery difficult.Though the particulars I have here stated,of the history and habits of these subterraneanspiders, demonstrate, in every respect, as faras we know them, the adaptation of means toan end, far above the intelligence of the animalthat exhibits them ; yet folly to appreciate theWisdom, and Power, and Goodness, that fabricatedher, and instigated her to exercise thesevarious arts, and to employ her power of spinningwebs, in building the structures necessary forher security, as well as for the capture of herprey, we ought to be witnesses to all her proceedings,which would probably instruct usmore fitly why she forms so deep a tube, andone so nicely covered with a peculiar tapestryfipom the mouth to the bottom. One of theseends is, doubtless, to keep her tube dry.2. Various are the modes of capturing theirprey, exercised by the second Tribe of spiders,which have only two gills, some fabricatingwebs of various kinds for that purpose, andothers lying in wait for them, and catchingthem by mere agility. The first of these arecalled weavers and the last, huntersSome of the form construct silken tubes ofAraneuUe Uxtorice, * A, venatoria.294 FUNCTIONS AND Incas.an irregular texture, open at both ends, in whichthey conceal themselves. Of this description isone, remarkable for having only six eyeswhich sits at the mouth of her tube, with herfour anterior legs out of if, reposing by theirextremity upon as many fine threads, whichdiverge from the mouth of the tube as from acentre, and probably contribute to form thetoils, or are connected with them, which DeGeer observed her to construct in front of herdens and in which large flies are taken, which,by means of her stout mandibles, she soon kills,and then sucks their juicesAnother species which spins a similar webwith diverging threads, forming so many snares,is remarkable for the pertinacity with whichit clings to its tube. The most effectual way toexpel it, is to put in a live ant ; scarcely hasit entered, when the spider, in a violent agitation,uses its utmost efforts to frighten the intruder;if the ant disregards its menaces, it rushes outprecipitately, and does not stop till it is two orthree inches distant, when it halts to watch themotions of the ant, which, usually, when disengagedfrom the web, falls to the ground;upon this taking place, the former reenter itstube backwards. This species, though driven1 Segestria senoculata, ' vii. 261.^ Walck. Araneid. de France, 195. ^ Segestria perdu.ARACHNIDAMS. 295fawn its habitation by so small an insect, willfearlessly attack the largest flies and it hasbeen seen even to seize a very active waspThe webs of the retire or geometric spiders,which dong to another division of the weavers,are so well known that it is not necessary togive a very detailed account of their proceedings ;but as Mr. Black wall, in a very interestingMemoir in the Zoological Journals has addedmuch to our previous knowledge on this head,especially with respect to the spiral circumvolutionsthat distinguish the webs of the tribein question, I shall abstract, as briefly as I can,the main features of his account. Havingformed the foundation of her net, and drawnthe skeleton of it, by spinning a number of raysconverging to the centre, she next proceeds,setting out from that point, to spin a spiral lineof adhesive web, like that of the rays, whichit intersects, and to which she attaches it, andafter numerous circumlocutions, finishes it at thecircumference. This line, in conjunction withthe rays, serves as a scaffolding for her to walkover, and it also keeps the rays properlystretched. Her next labour is to spin a spiralor labyrinthiform line from the circumferencetowards the centre, but which stops somewhatshort of it ; this line is the most important partWalck. Araneid. de France, 202, ' v. 181.296 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.of the snare. It consists of a fine thread;studded with minute viscid globules, like deir,which by their adhesive quality retain theinsects that fly into the net. The snare beingthus finished, the little geometrical selectssome concealed spot in its vicinity, where sheconstructs a cell, in which she may hide herself,and watch for game; of the capture ofwhich, she is informed by the vibrations ofa line of communication between her cell andthe centre of her snare.The insects that frequent the waters requirepredaceous animals to keep them within duelimits, as well as those that inhabit the earth,and the water spider is one of the most remarkableupon whom that office is devolvedby her Creator. To this end her instinctinstructs her to fabricate a kind of diving-bdl inthe bosom of that element. She usually selectsstill waters for this purpose. Her house is anoval cocoon, filled with air, and lined with silk,from which threads issue in every direction,and are fastened to the surrounding plants;in this cocoon, which is open below she watchesfor her prey, and even appears to pass thewinter, when she closes the opening. It ia mostcommonly, yet not always, entirely under water ;but its inhabitant has filled it with air for her^ Argyroneta aquatka^ARACUNIDANS. 297operation, which enables her to live in it*Sha conveys the air to it in the followingmanner: she usually swims upon her back,when her abdomen is enveloped in a bubble ofair, and appears like a globe of quicksilver;with this she enters her cocoon, and displacingan equal mass of water, again ascends for asecond lading, till she has sufficiently filled herhouse with it, so as to expel all the water. Themales construct similar habitations, by the samemanoeuvres. How these little animals can envelopetheir abdomen with an air-bubble, andrain it till they enter their cells, is still one ofNature's mysteries that have not been explained.We cannot help, however, admiring and adoringthe Wisdom, Power, and Goodness manifestedin this singular provision, enabling an animalthat breathes the atmospheric air, to fill herhouse with it under the water ; and which hasinstructed her in a secret art, by which she canclothe part of het body with air, as with agarment, which she can put off when it answersher purpose. This is a kind of attraction andrepulsion that mocks all our inquiries.Amongst the spiders called the hunters andthe vagrants, some seize their prey like the lionor the tiger, with the aid of few or no toils,by jumping upon them, when they come withintheir reach. I have often observed a white2d8 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.or yellowish species of crab-spiders tribeso called because their motions resemble thoseof crabs — ^which lies in wait for her prey inthe blossoms of umbelliferous and other white-blossomedplants, and can scarcely be distinguishedfrom them, which when a fly or otherinsect alights upon the flower, darts upon itbefore she is perceived.There is a very common black and whitespider amongst the vagrants which may alwaysbe seen in summer, on sunny rails, windowsills,&c. : when one of these spiders, which arealways upon the watch, spies a fly or a gnatat a distance, he approaches softly, step bystep, and seems to measure the interval thatseparates him from it with his eye; and, ifhe judges that he is within reach, first fixinga thread to the spot on which he is stationed,by means of his fore feet, which are muchlonger and larger than the others, he darts uponhis victim with such rapidity, and so true anaim, that he seldom misses it. Whether hisstation is vertical or horizontal is of little consequence,he can leap equally well from either,and in ail directions. He is prevented fromfalling, by the thread just mentioned, which actsRelated probably to Thomisus cities,SalticHs scenic.ARACHNIDANS. 299tiB a kind of anchor, and enables him .to recoverhis station, when without such a help he wouldbe, BB it were, driven out to sea.We see in these latter instances, that thoughthe art and means of weaving snares to entraptheir prey have not been granted to thesehunters and vagrants, yet that their Creatorhas endowed them with increase of agility, andthe power of moving, without turning round,in all directions, which filly make up to themfor that want.Before I conclude this history of spiders, Imust mention a very remarkable one, describedand figured by Freycinet, under the name ofAranea notacanthay^ but which appears to belongto no known genus of the Order. It is stated tohave at its pastor extremity a long cylindricaltube, terminated by two eyes I ! But this,surely, must be a mistake. At the anterior partof the thorax are four eyes, in a square, and oneon each side. The form of the abdomen and itstube are very remarkable. This spider wasfound in a small island near Port Jackson, in anirregular web attached to the shrubs.2. The Pedipalpsy forming the second Orderof Arachnidans, will not detain us long. Theprincipal animals belonging to it, are the scarsPlate XI.

Their usedalone, when they are moving with their openforceps advanced before their head, and theirtail turned over it, is enough to create nolittle alarm in the beholder; and if he weretold that one genus of the tribe goes by thename of man^kUler^ and should read in Aristotle,that though some were harmless, the sting ofothers was fatal both to man and beast,* thedegree of his alarm would not be diminished.But though the venom of these creatures, whenprovoked and put upon self-defence, may sometimesprove fatal to man and the higher animals,yet this is not the main purpose for which theirCreator has given them such means of annoy annaTheir food consists of various beetles and othoinsects, arachnidans, and wood-lice; many ofwhich they could not easily master and devour,after they have seized them with their forceps,without the aid of their tail and its sting;' thisthey can turn over their head, and moving 'Ain any direction, immediately kill their prey,1 Androctonui.• Hist, Animal.

Probably the animalsthat they feed upon offer less resistance thanthe. prey of the latter.With regard to the Arachnidans in general,the object of their creation appears to have beento assist in keeping within due bounds theinsect population of the globe. The membersof this great and interesting Class are so givento multiply beyond all bounds, that were itnot for the various animal that are directedby the law of their Creator to make them theirfood, the whole Creation, at least the organizedmembers of it, would suffer great injury, if nottotal destruction, from the myriad forms thatwould invest the face of universal nature with aliving veil of animal and plant devourers. Toprevent this sad catastrophe, it was given in> Phrynus^ Sc. * Thtlyplumus.302 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.charge to the spiders, to set traps everywhereand to weave their pensile toils, from branchto branch, and frown tree to tree, and even todive under the waters. And, more particularly,to them we are mainly indebted for onr deliverancefrom a plague oi flies of every description,which, if the spiders were removed,of which they form the principal food, wouldsubject us to incredible annoyancesThe scorpions, and other Pedipidps, arefound only in warm climates, where they areoften very numerous, and, like the c^itipedes,creep into beds.^ Insects multiply, beyondconception, in such climates, and unless Providencehad reinforced his army of insectiyorousanimals, it would haye been impossible to existin tropical regions. The animals we are speakingof, not only destroy all kinds of beeves,grass-hoppers, and other insects, but also theirlarves, and even eggs.Pseudarachnidan CondyJapes.This Class, which is formed from the Tra€heanfAracknidans of Latreille, differs from the precedingprincipally in the organs of Respirationand Circulation.Body coriaceous, or crustaceous.

I have already given an account of themost interesting genus of this Order, the Sol-^pugOy on a former occasi<Mi ;^ and there is littleknown of the history of the hook-crabs exceptthat they are often found in books ; I have alsooccasionally met with them in the drawers ofmy insect cabinets, moving slowly on, withtheir arms expanded, probably they were insearch of the mite that is so injurious tospecimens of insects ; they are also often foundupon flies. One genus,' in this tribe, has bureyes, all the rest of the Class have only two.2. The most remarkable genus of the secondOrder of Pseudamchnidans is one described inthe Linnean Transactions in which the posteriorSee above, p. 85, • Heifer ' Obisium.Oonyleptet. K. ^ xii. 450. /. xxii./. 16.304 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.legs exhibit a rapturous character, and seemfitted either to seize or retain their prey. Thecommon Phalangidans, or harvest-men, havebeen treated of in another placesThe animals of this class seem to be universallyinsectivorous, though fabricating no snares.•Cardan Condyhpes.We are now arrived at a Class of Condylopes,that, with respect to their food have a muchmore extensive commission than those whichwe have lately considered, the Arachnidans,and Pseudarachnidans. Under the name ofmites they are universally known, and whensome of our most essential articles of food, ascheese and flour, get old, or in any dreemusty, they soon swarm with these minuteanimals, which, wherever they are established,multiply beyond conception; mites also attacknot only decaying substances, but also livingones; in man they are the cause of a mostrevolting distemper;' under the name of ticksthey attack dogs and other animals, and fewinsects altogether escape from their annoyance ;and they not only infest the inhabitants of theearth and air, but are also found swimming inevery pool ; so that their field of action seemsto be the whole creation of organize beings.1 See above, p. 90. ^ See The Lancet y i. 1834-5. 59.ARACHNIDANS. 305The Class may be thus characterized :Body without any inspection or impressionmarking out its parts, consisting of a singlesent, and without folds. Mouth and organsvarious. Eyes 2. Legs 6 — 8, short.Latreille has divided this Class, including init the preceding one, into seven Families ; butperhaps it would be better to consider it asdivided into two Orders, mites and tkks^'^or those that do not suck their food, and thosethat are fitted with an organ adapted to suction.I shall select an instance or two from animalsof this Class, which shew the care of theCreator, for these little beings apparently solow in the scale of Creation ; His foresight ofevery circumstance in which they would beplaced ; and His adaptation of their structureto their assigned station.This is particularly conspicuous in the caseof a Species of bat-mites which was first noticedby one of our most celebrated microscopicalobservers, Mr. Baker, and has since fallen underthe notice of M. V. Audoin, well known for hisacute investigation of the external parts ofInsects, who kindly sent me a memoir of hison this and other Americans, extracted from theAnnales des Sciences Naturelles for the year1832. If we consider the animal that this miteAcari. ^ Rimini. * Pteroptes.VOL. n. X306 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.inhabits, the bat, and that it affords much lessshelter than the birds, to any parasite that maybeattached to it, especially as the species thatI am speaking of is stated usually to fix itselfto the membrane of the wings, which being anaked membrane, would seem to expose it to beeasily shaken off when the animal is flying:we easily comprehend that it stands in need ofsome particular provision to counteract this circumstance.Like those of many other mites, its feet arefurnished with a vesicle which is capable ofcontraction and dilatation, and which the animalcan probably use as a sucker to fix itself; butif by any sudden jerk it is unfixed, to prevent itsfalling, it is gifted with the power of turningupwards, in an instant, two, four, six, or even allits legs, according to circumstances, sufficientlyto support itself, and can walk in this position*,as it were upon its back, as well as it does in theordinary way with that part upwards ; it may beoften seen with four turned upwards while itwalks upon the other four,* so that it is ready,upon any accident, instantaneously to use them,and to lay hold of the wing.The bat is infested by another parasite, placedby Dr. Leach at the end of the Americans, and byLatreille, but not without hesitation, after theBaker on Mice, iu 407. /. xv./. b. f. o.ARACHNIDANS. 307Diptera. I may therefore be justified in introducingthe animal in question here, since, inhabitingthe same subject, their proceedings willserve to illustrate each other, and to demonstratethe agency and design of the Supreme Cause inthe concurring structure of these parasites. Theone I here allude to may be called the hat-louseLatreille, who has described very minutelya species of this genus,' informs us thattheir head is implanted in a singular situation,the back of the thorax, between the middle andthe anterior extremity,' immediately behind thepart to which the anterior legs are attache.The middle of the back, in the common species,presents a cavity, which terminates posteriorlyin a kind of pouch ,^ so that the head can bethrown back and its extremity received by it.From this situation, it is evident that the animalcannot take its nutriment from the bat in theordinary position, with the back upwards; itmust, therefore, necessarily stand with it downwardswhen engaged in suction. When underthe forming hand of the Almighty Creator, its1^8 were planted, it was not on the lower side ofthe trunk, as they usually are in other hexapods,but on the upper side or margin of that partsColonel Montague observes, — '- So strange andNycteribia, Lat. * N, Blainvilliu3 See Montague.

Insect Antelopes.The animals of the class we are next to consider,have been regarded by many modem zoologists,especially of the French school, as inferior bothto Crustaceans and Arachnidans, on account oftheir having only, as it were, a rudimental heart,exhibiting indeed a kind of systole and diastole,but unaccompanied by any system of vessels bywhich the blood might circulate in them. Alearned and acute writer, and eminent zoologist,amongst our own countrymen, has with greatforce controverted the justice of this sentence ofdegradation pronounced upon Insects; an opinionwhich has also been embraced by manyother modern writers on the subject, and considerabledoubt has been shown to rest upon themain foundations upon which the illustrious andlamented Baron Cuvier, who was the father ofthe hypothesis, had built it.*But the important discoveries of Dr. Cams,who first proved that a circulation really existsin various larves of Insects, and afterwards thatMac Leay, Hor, Entomology, 904, 297,Insect' CON D Y LOPES. 3 1 1it is also discoverable in several perfect oneshave placed the matter beyond all doubt. Taking,therefore, into consideration the nervoussystem of Insects, as well as those of circulationand respiration, as ought, in all reason, to be done—for upon comparison of these three systems sointimately connected with life and sensation,surely the first place is due to that by which alonethe animal is conscious of its existence and that ofthe world it inhabits, and is enabled to run therace appointed by its Creator ; surely if even noCams had appeared to demonstrate the existenceof a circulation in these animals, still theperfection of their nervous system, comparedwith that of the MoUuscans, in determiningtheir respective stations, would be a sufficientcounterpoise to a heart and vascular system forcirculation ; and if to this superiority we addthe number and nature of the several organs bywhich this system acts, and the fruits of suchagency in the activity and various instincts ofthe animals endowed with it, embodying themoving will, the informing sense, the impellingappetite, compared with the inertness and sluggishmotions, and apathetic existence, and paucityof instinctive actions in the great majorityof the Molluscans, — who is there that will hesitateto conclude that He who created the Insect1 Introdd. to Comp.

Spinal chord knotty, terminatinganteriorly in a bilobed brain ; a heart and imperfectcirculation sometimes vascular, andsometimes extra-vascular ; respiration by trachea ^receiving the air by spiracles; /^^.^ jointed, ia theperfect insect always six.The Class of Insects may be divided into twoSub-classes viz. Ametabolians^ or those that donot undergo any metamorphosis and have nowings ; and Metabolians, or those that undergoa metamorphosis and are usually fitted withwings in their final state.Sub-class 1. — Ametabolians are further subdividedinto two Orders Thysanurans and Parasites.Order 1. — The Thysanurans are remarkablefor their anal appendages, which consist eitherof jointed organs resembling antennae, andapproaching very near to the caudal organs ofthe cockroach,^ the use of which is not certainlyknown ; or of an inflexed elastic caudalfork bent under the abdomen, which enablesthem to leap with great agility. To the firstof these tribes belongs the common sugar lause,^and to the last the spring tails .^It must be observed, however, that this is notSee above, p. 18. ^ Blatta.^ Lepisma. * Podura, Sminthunu.INSECT CONDYLOPES. 315a natural Order, for there is no analogy betweenthe jointed tails of the sugar-louse, which somehave supposed to belong or approach to theOrthopterUf and the unjointed leaping organ ofthe spring'tail. The latter animals, indeed,seem to form an osculant tribe, without the paleof the Class of Insects, and perhaps havingsome reference to the Chilopodans amongst theMyriapods, with which they agree, in havingonly simple eyes, like spiders, on each side ofthe head. Those of the spring-tails consist ofeight such eyes, arranged in a double series, andplanted in an oval space, in shape resemblingan Insect's eye. The Chilopodans have onlyfour on each side. The Insects of this Orderprobably feed upon detritus, whether animalor vegetable, their masticating organs beingvery weak, and fitted to comminute only putrescentsubstances.Order 2. — The Order of Parasites — consistingof the most unclean and disgusting animals ofthe whole Class, infest both man, beast, and bird,and no less than four species, accounted byline, &c. as varieties, being attached to theformer — may be divided into two sections, thosethat live by suction, and those that masticatetheir food. To the first of these belong thePeniculus Capitis, Corporis, Nigritarum, and PhthisisPubis,316 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.human and the dog-louse, and to the other thevarious lice that inhabit the birds of whichalmost every species has a peculiar one.I have, on a former occasion, alluded to theOrder of Parasites when speaking of punitiveanimals :^ here I must observe, that like otherinstruments employed by God to visit the sinsof mankind, they are intended to produce asanative effect, as well as to punishes It isgenerally known that they abound only on thosewhose habits are dirty, in whom they may preventthe diseases which such habits would otherwisegenerate, as well as stimulate them togreater attention to personal cleanliness. Thehird-hnse is probably useful to birds in devouringthe sordes which must accumulate at theroot of their plumes.Sub-class 2. — Metabolians, by most modemwriters on Insects, are considered, from theiroral organs, as constituting two Sections, whichare denominated Haustellate and CandidateInsects. I may here observe that the instrumentof suction in a Haustellate south consistsof pieces, though differently circumstanced, preciselyanalogous to those employed in masticationin a Mandibulate one, which has been most1 Ninus.» Vol. 1. p. 12.

Savigny, in the first part of hisAnimaux sans Verthh^es}Ab there are several Orders called Occupantsthat are intermediate between these Sections, Ishall arrange the whole in three columns.Occupant ORDERS.1.

Cleopatra.With regard to the characters of theseOrders:Order 1. — The Aphaniptera (Flea Chigoe) areapterous and parasitic, but differ from theOrder of Parasites by undergoing a metamorphosis.They connect the Victorious Parasiteswith the Diptera.Order 2. — The Hymenoptera (^Forest-Jly ^ ^c.)called also Pupipara^ because their eggs arehatched in the matrix of the mother, where theypass their larve state, and are not excluded tillt. i.— iv.318 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.they have become pupes. Most of them havetwo wings, but one genus is apterous:^ theseseem intermediate between certain Acaridansyas the bat-mite, and the Diptera; they seemalso, in some respects, to connect with theArachnidanSf whence they have been calledspider-flies.Order 3. — The Trichoptera careworn-flied)have four hairy membranous wings, in theirnervures resembling those of Lepidoptera theunder ones folding longitudinally. The mouthhas four palpi, but the masticating oi^ans aremerely rudimental. Their place seems to besomewhere between the saw-flies and thosemoths whose caterpillars clothe themselves withdifferent substances.Order 4. — ^^The Hemiptera (Earwigs) havetwo elytra and two wings of membrane, foldedlongitudinally, and their tail is armed with aforceps. They appear to be between the Coleopteraand Orthoptera.Order 5. — The Strepsiptera wild heefly^Waspfly\ parasitic animals, that have twoample wings, forming the quadrant of a circle,and of a substance between coriaceous and membranous,and two elytriform sub spiral organs,appendages of the base of the anterior legs.Their place is uncertain, some placing themOesophagus, The Sheep louse.INSECT CONDYLOPES. 319between the Coleoptera and Hemiptera; andothers between the Lepidoptera and Diptera.Order 6. — The Diptera^ (Two-winged Fliesand Gnats &c.) as their name indicates, haveonly two membranous wings, usually accompaniedby two ringlets representing the underwings of the Tetrapterous Orders, and twopoisersj which appear connected with a spiracle.Order 7. — The Lepidoptera (Butterflies andMoths) have four membranous wings, coveredwith minute scales, varying in shape.Order 8. — The Homoptera ( Tree LocustsFrog-hoppers, Froth-hoppers) have four deflexedwings, often of a substance between coriaceousand membranous.Order 9. — The Hemiptera (Bugs, &c.^ havefour organs of flight, the upper pair being homyor coriaceous, but tipped, in the generality, withmembrane, the lower pair being membranous.Order 10. — The Hymenoptera, (Saw Flies ,Gall Flies, Ichneumon Flies, Bees, Wasps, Ants,&c.) which are the analogues of the Diptera,have four membranous wings, and the tail of thefemale is usually armed with a sting, or instrumentuseful in laying their eggs.Order 11. — The Neuroptera (Dragon Flies,Lace-winged Flies, Ephemeral Flies, White Ants,&c.) have four membranous wings, usually retiresFUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.related by numerous nervures, but no sting orovipositor. They are analogues, especially of the Lepidoptera.Order 12. — The Orthoptera (CockroachesLocusts Praying-insects y Spectres, Grasshoppers,Crickets, &c.) have mostly two tegmina, or upperwings, of a substance between coriaceous andmembranous, and two under ones, formed ofmembrane, and folded longitudinally when unemployed.These are analogues of the Honwp-tera.Order 13. — The Coleoptera (Beetles) have twoupper organs, of a homy or leathery substance,called elytra, to cover their two membranouswings, which are folded longitudinally and transversely.These are analogues of the Hemiptera,especially those with no apical membrane.In considering the three descriptions of Ordershere enumerated and characterized, it must berecollected that we are not following the usualorder of arrangement in systems, that of descendingfrom the highest to the lowest ; butthat we are ascending in an inverse direction,consequently that, in the above tables, the lowestnumbers indicate the lowest and not the highestOrders.I shall now make some remarks, as to theirfunctions and uses, upon the animals constitutingthese several Orders, enlivening themINSECT CONDYLOPES. 321occasionally with such histories, not before produced,or not well known, as may interest thereader and answer the great end of this treatise,the glory of God, as manifested in the historyand instincts of animals.Before, however, I enter upon the separateconsideration of these Orders, I must premisea few remarks upon the circumstance which distinguishesthem from the preceding Sub-class,their metamorphoses. I have, on a former occasionsmentioned some beneficial effects m-^suiting from this law of the Creator; and itsaction and the results of it have been so ablyexplained and illustrated in another treatisesthat it is quite unnecessary for me to enterlargely into the subject. The striking remarksmade upon the developements of the higheranimals, towards the close of the treatise alludedtoss merit particular attention.It has been observed by an ingenious andlearned writer* on this subject — that every speciesof plant, in the course of the year, exhibits itselfin different states. First are seen the succulentstems adorned with the young foliage, nextemerge the buds of the flowers then the cal3rxopens, and permits the tender and lovely blossomsto expand. The insects destined to feedupon each plant must be simultaneous in theirSee above, p. 26. « Roget. B. T, i. 302—316.5 Ibid. ii. 631. ♦ Dr. They.VOL. n. Y322 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.development. If the butterfly came forth beforethere were any flowers, she would in vainsearch for the nectar that forms her food ; and ifthe caterpillar was hatched after the leaves hadbegun to fade and wither, she could not exerciseher functions In another passage he thus illustratesthis analogy between the metamorphosesof the insect and the successive developements ofthe plant. If we first place an egg, says he,next to it its caterpillar, further on its chrysalis,and lastly the butterfly ; what have we but ananimal stem, an elongation perfectly analogousto that of the plant proceeding from its seed, byits stem and its appendages to the bud, theblossom, and the seed again ?' For the differentkinds and forms of larves and pupes I mustrefer the reader to another work,' merely observingthat, in their forms, the larves seem torepresent all the preceding Classes of Condy-lopes, and also some Annelidans and MoUuscans.The great majority of pupes are not locomotive,and take no food, while the rest are locomotiveand continue to feed. This circumstance sometimesexposes the former to the attacks of theirenemies, the ichneumon, and thus numbers aredestroyed which would otherwise escape; butthough, in this state, they are thus more exposedto the attack of one enemy, they are more ef-> N.

There is so close a connectionbetween theol, the pupiparaus insects y andthe tfoo'wingedfliesj that it will be best to considerthem under one head. The former of these, thefleas the mosquitos, or gnats and the horse-fliesall suck the blood of man, as well as thatof beast or birds The wonderful strength andagility of the flea are well known and it appearsto have been endowed with those facultiesby its Creator, to render its change of stationfrom one animal to another, and means of escape,more easy ; and though the bite of mosquitos,and other blood-suckers, is, at certaintimes of the year and in certain climates, analmost intolerable annoyances yet, doubtless,some good end is answered by it ; with regard tocattle, it is evident that, while they are sufferingfrom the attack of these blood-letters, their feedingis more or less interrupted ; a circumstancewhich may be attended by beneficial effects totheir health ; and probably even to man, thetorment he experiences may be compensated, in» Pulex, * Culex. • Tabanus.

It is remarked of thisgroup, which is parasitic upon beasts and birds,that its internal structure is particularly accommodatedto this circumstance; it is furnishedwith a regular matrix, consisting of a largemuscle-membranous pocket, and with ovariestotally different from those of other insects ; but,by their configuration and position, exhibiting aconsiderable resemblance to those of a woman .^The reason of this singular aberration from thegestation of other Diptera^ which, with few exceptions,are oviparous, seems connected withtheir peculiar habits : in their perfect state theyare usually winged, and attach themselves externallyto horses, oxen, &c.; it may thereforebe the means of preserving the race from extinction,that they are supported in the womb of^ Latr.

Thegrubs, by their action in their several stations,produce a purulent matter, which they imbibe,and which is stated by those who have studiedthem, to be beneficial to the animals theyattacks Another tribe of this Order, Xk^ifiesh-flies \Q,y their eggs on dead bodies, and soonremove those nuisances, and the putrid and^ (Estrus, Sc.The species of gad-flies here alluded to are Gastric Equiand Osseous BovU, (E, Oves and (E, Hominis,Sarcophagi,320 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.pestilential miasmata which they occasion, fromthe face of our globe. This function is of suchimportance to the welfare of our species, thatsome of these ^ie^, in order that no time may belost, are viviparous and bring forth their youngin a state in which they can begin their work assoon as they are born.The aphidivor<ms flies have another function,in conjunction with the lace-winged flieB^^ lady-birdsand some other insects, to reduce andkeep within due limits the infinite myriads ofthe plant-licej^ which, in these climates, are theuniversal pests of the garden, the orchard, andthe field. There are also flies that lay theireggs in the combs of humble-bees which, as itwere, wear their livery, for the hairs that clothetheir body are so disposed and coloured, as toimitate that of the bee, whose nests they frequent; so that, probably, they are often mistakenfor members of the family, and effect their mischiefunmolested .Another tribe of flies, called hornet-flies withsome others related to theme like a hawk orother predaceous bird, seize their prey withtheir legs, or their beaks but it can only be withi Se-vivipara, ^ Surplus, Sfc.^ Hemerobiux, * Cochineal.Aphides. ^ Columella ^c.^ Asiius, * Kempis,• Introdd. to Ent. i. 274.INSECT CONDYLOPES. 327the view of Bucking its juices as they hare noindicating organs.Dipterous insects, however, are not confined toanimal food, whether living or putrescent, manyalso subsist upon a vegetable diet. Mushroomsand other agarics sometimes swarm with thegrubs of certain flies or gnats ;^ others pass theirfirst states in decaying timber; the narcissusand onion flies' feast upon the bulbs from whichthey take their name ; and a little gnat,' when agrub, feeds upon the pollen of the flowers ofthe wheat.To these may be added those flies, that intheir first state, may be regarded as purifiers ofstagnant waters, and other offensive fluids orsemi-fluids. The larves of the gnat or mosquitoare aquatic animals which may be seen eithersuspended at the surface, or sinking in moststagnant waters, compensate in some degree,for the torment of their blood-thirsty attacks,by discharging this function, and assisting tocleanse our stagnant waters from principles thatmight otherwise generate infection. A varietyof others contribute their efforts to bring aboutthe same beneficial purpose. Almost all theDiptera^ in their perfect state, even the bloodsuckers,emulate the bees, in imbibing the nectarMycttephilay jc.Eristalis Narcissi, and Scatopliaga Parum.Cscidamyia Triiici.328 FUNCTIONS AND 1N9TINCT8.from the various flowers with which God hasdecorated the earth, and thus assist in keepingwithin due limits, the, otherwise suffocating,sweets that th exhale.From the statement here given, we see thatthe Creator has provided the m^oibeis of thisOrder with a very diversified bill of fare, andthat their efforts in their several states, andvarious departments, are of the first importance,as scavengers and curators, to remove or mitigatenuisances, that would otherwise deform andtend to depopulate our globe. What they wantin volume, is compensated for by numbers, forperhaps the individuals of no Order are so numerous.It is true, in particular periods, the locustsand aphides seem to outnumber them ; yet, ordinarily,the two-winged race, are those whicheverywhere most force themselves upon ourattention ; during nearly three-fourths of theyear we hear their hum, and see their motions,in our apartments, and even in the depth ofwinter, in sunny weather, by their myriads,dancing up and down under every hedge, theycatch inattention in our walks.Order 10. — If we next turn our attention tothe tnandilfulate Order, which stands most incontrast with the Diptera^ the Hymenopteraimmediately occurs to us, in which we find avariety of forms, which seem made to imitateINSECT CONDYLOPEB. 329thoife of flies, or vice versa. Thus there areflies that resemble saw-flies ; others that simulatethe ichneumouidan parasites ; others againthat resemble wasps, bees, and humble-bees.Though the Insects belonging to this Orderare included in the mandibulate Section; fortheir mouth is furnished with mandibles andmaxillae ; yet they do not generally use them tomasticate their food but for purposes usuallyconnected with their sequence of instincts, asthe bees in building their cells;' the wasps inscraping particles of wood from posts and rails forasimilar purpose, and likewise to seize theirprey ; but the great instrument by which, intheir perfect state, they collect their food istheir tongue this, the bees particularly havethe power of inflating, and can wipe with it bothconcave and convex surfaces ; and with it they,as it were, Itck^ but not suck the honey from theblossoms, for, as Reaumur has proved, this organacts as a tongue and not as a pumps In thenumerous tribes that compose this most interestingof the Orders, the tongue is lambent, andvaries considerably in its structure, but in thegreat majority it is a flattish organ, often dividedinto several lobes.Some entomological writers have bestowedupon the members of the present Order the title1 AMjriHeSf Meg. * See above, p. 188. ' Mem. See. v. 322.330 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.of Principes as if they were the princes of theClass of Insects, and if we consider the conspicuousmanifestation of the Divine attributesof Power, Wisdom, and Goodness, exhibited inthe wonderful instincts of those of them that aregregarious we shall readily concede to them thistitle. If superior wisdom and devotedness tothe general good are the best titles to rank andstation ; the laborious and indefatigable ant andthe hee celebrated from the earliest ages for itswonderful economy, its admirable structures,and its useful products, are surely entitled to it,though they cannot vie with the insects of manyof the other Orders in size, and in the brilliancyand variety of their colours, and the pencil ofthe Creator has not decorated their wings withthe diversified paintings which adorn those ofthe butterfly.The functions which are given in charge tothe several members of this Order are various.Some, like the predaceous and carnivorous tribesof the JDiptera^ appear engaged in perpetualwarfare with other insects ; thus the wasps andharness seize flies of every kind that come intheir way, and will even attack the meat in dieshambles; the caterpillar-wasps walks off withcaterpillars the spider-wasp* with spiders and thefly-wasps mihi flies. But the motive that influx' Pompous, ' Bembe:^*INSECT CONDYLOPES. 331'faces them, will furnish an excuse for theirpredatory habits. They do not commit theseacts of violence to gratify their own thirst forblood, like many of the flies, but to furnish theiryoung with food suited to their natures. Thewasp carries the pieces of flesh she steals fromthe butcher to the young grubs in the cells of herpaper mansion. The other wasps I mentionedeach commit their eggs to the animal they aretaught to select, and then bury it ; so that theyoung grub when hatched may revel in plentySome of the Hymenoptera prefer a vegetablediet, and assist the Lepidoptera in their office.The caterpillars which infest many species ofwillow are hatched from the eggs of the saw-fliesone genus' nearly related to them confinesitself to timber, to which it is sometimesvery destructive.Another tribe affect plants in a very remarkablemanner. Their egg-placer, like a magician'swand, is gifted with the privilege, by aslight puncture in the twig or leaf of any shrubor tree, or the stalk of any plant, to cause theproduction of a wonderful and monstrous excrescence,sometimes resembling moss, as in theBedeguar of the rose, at other times, a kindof apple, or a transparent berry, both of whichSee Introdd. to EnU i. 346.Cimex Tenthredoy Leda, Sfc, See Introdd, to Ent, i.255.• Sire*332 FUNCTIONS AND lNi(TINCTS.seeming fruits, the oak, when touched by two ofthese little gall-flies of different species, producesas well as acorns : various other forms their gallsassume, which need not be here mentioned.It is to be observed that the eggs of these gall-fliesgrow after they are laid, and perhapsthese singular productions are more favourableto their growth, being softer and more spongyand succulent than the twigs themselves wouldbe. Even here Creative Power, Wisdom, andGoodness are conspicuously manifested, in providingsuch wonderful nests for these littlegerme-like eggs ; these excrescences, indeed,instead of deforming the plants they are producedfrom, are often ornamental to them ; andbesides this are also, some of them, of thehighest utility to mankind — witness the Aleppooak-galls to which learning, commerce, the arts,and every individual who has a distant friend,are so deeply indebted.Another tribe is equally useful in a differentdepartment; I allude to those Hymenopterathat are parasitic upon other Insects, parti 'clearly upon the destructive hordes of caterpillarsthat are often so injurious both to thehorticulturist and agriculturist. These insectsare denominated by Latreille Pupivaraus^ not,as some may suppose, because they devourIntrodd, to Ent, i. 446. * Cynics Scriptor.INSECT CONDYLOPES. 333insects in their second, or pope state, but fromthe classical meaning of the word, because theydevour them before they are arrived at theirperfect or adult state. This tribe may be consideredas divided into two great bodies, onerepresented by the proper Ichneumon of Linn,which have, usually, veined wings, and the abdomenconnected with the trunk by a footstalk ;the other forming the Minute Ichneumon of thatgreat reviver of Natural History, distinguished,usually, by having wings with few or no veinson their disk, and by a sessile abdomen. Theseattack eggs and chrysalis, as well as caterpillars.Though the latter are the principal,yet they are not the only object of the greatIchneumonidan host, for they attack insects ofevery order indiscriminately; they seem, however,to annoy beetles, grasshoppers, bugs, andfroghoppers, less than others.

In the montht>f August, 1824, in the nest of a species ofwasps he found more than fifty specimens ofa singular \iti\e beetle which may be called thewasp-beetles long known to frequent wasps' nests.From their being found in cells which wereclosed by a kind of operculum, he conjecturesthat they lay their eggs in the grub of the wasp,upon which they doubtless feed. Subsequent tothis, upon opening some of the cells, he wassurprised to find, instead of the beetles, severalspecimens of an Ichneumon belonging to Jurine sgenus, Anamalan.^ Upon another examination,some days after this, no more of these last insectsappearing, he discovered that they hadbeen pierced, in their chrysalis state, by aminute species belonging to the family of Choirof which he found no less than twentyspecimens flying about in search of their prey.From the above facts," Mr. Hope remarks,we have a convincing proof, if . such werewanted, of a Superintending Power which ordainschecks and counterchecks to remedy thesuper fecundity of the insect world."

Mr.Hope observed, and the fact is curious, that thespecimens of the wasp-beetle obtained from thefemale wasps were about one-third larger thanthe others.But of all the Hymenopterous, or indeed anyother Insects, there are none, as I before observed,that illustrate the primary attributes ofthe Deity more strikingly than those that aregregarious which build for the members of theirsocieties spacious colleges, if I may so call them,capable often of containing many thousand inhabitants,and remarkable for the pains theybestow upon the nurture and education of theiryoung. There are three great tribes in thepresent Order, distinguished by this instinct, —the wasps and hornets the bees and humble-beesand the ants. .The wasps and hornets are remarkable for thecurious papier-mach edifices, in the constructionof which they employ filaments of wood, —scraped from posts and rails with their ownjaws, — mixed with saliva, of which the hexa-336 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.goal cells, in which they rear their young, areformed, and often their combs are separated andsupported by pillars of the same material ; andthe external walls of their nests are formedby foliaceous layers of their ligneous papersLatreille mentions a Brazilian species thatmakes an abundant provision of honey.In the book of Joshua we are informed* thatGod, by means of some animal of this genus,drove out the two kings of the Ammonites frombefore the Children of Israel.

Their great functionseaois to be to remove every thing thatappears to be out of its place, and cannot goabout its own business. I have seen several ofthem dragging a half-dead snake, about the sizeof a goose-quill.

They are usuallyattached near the extremity of a branch, andsome of the twigs pass through the nest. A verticalsection presents a number of irregularcells, formed by the same process as the exterior.Towards the interior the cells are morecapacious than those removed from the centre,and an occasional dried leaf is taken advantageof to assist in their formation. The nurseriesfor the young broods in different stages of developmentare in different parts of the nest. Thecells nearest the centre are filled with veryminute eggs, the youngest members of the community; those more distant, with larger eggs,^mixed with larves; and the most remote, withpupes near disclosure. In fact, in these lastcoils only were found winged insects. Thefemale is in a large or royal cell, near the centreof the nest : she is about half an inch long, ofthe thickness of a crow-quill, white, and theabdomen has five or six brown ligatures round it,like the female of the white ants ; the head isvery small, and the legs mere rudiments : she iskept a close prisoner, and incapable of motion inher cell, a circumstance in which these appearIt should seem from this that the eggs grow.342 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.to approach the white ants, and which indicatedthat they should form a distinct genus.There was no store of provisions in the nests ;they were indebted therefore for their support todaily labour. We may gain some idea of theirperseverance when we consider that the materialof which the nest is formed — cow-dung —must have been sought for on the earth, andprobably carried from a considerable distanceup the trees.Colonel Sykes related to me another anecdotewith regard to an Indian species of ant,which he calls the large black ant instancing,in a wonderful manner, their perseverance inattaining a favourite object, which was witnessedby himself, his lady, and his whole household.When resident at Poona, the dessert,consisting of fruits, cakes, and various preserves,always remained upon a small side-table, in averandah of the dining-room. To guard againstinroads the legs of the table were immersedin four basins filled with water; it was removedan inch from the wall, and, to keep offdust through open windows, was covered with atable-cloth. At first the ants did not attempt tocross the water, but as the strait was very narrow,from an inch to an inch and a half, and thesweets very tempting, they appear at length tohave braved all risks, to have committed tbem-INSECT CONDYLOP^, 343selves to the deep, to have scrambled across thechannel, and to have reached the object of theirdesires, for hundreds we found every morningrevelling in enjoyment: daily vengeance wasexecuted upon them without lessening theirnumbers; at last the legs of the table werepainted, just above the water, with a circle ofturpentine. This at first seemed to prove aneffectual barrier, and for some days the sweetswere unmolested, after which they were againattacked by these resolute plunderers ; but how^^y got at them seemed totally unaccountable,till Col. Sykes, who often passed the table, wassurprised to see an ant drop from the wall,about a foot above the table, upon the cloth thatcovered it ; another and another succeeded. Sothat though the turpentine and the distancefrom the wall appeared effectual barriers, stillthe resources of the animal, when determinedto carry its point, were not exhausted, and byascending the wall to a certain height, with aslight effort against it, in falling it managed tolandin safety upon the table. Col. Sykesasks, — is this instinct? I should answer, no:the animal's appetite is greatly excited, its scentprobably informs it where it must seek the objectof its desire ; it first attempts the nearest road ;when this is barricaded it naturally ascends thewalls near which the table was placed, and so344 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.succeeds by casting itself down, — all the whileunder the guidance of its sensesIt is observed, in the Introduction to Entomology,that though ants, '^ during the coldwinters, in this country, remain in a slate oftorpidity, and have no need of food, yet inwarmer regions, during the rainy seasons, whenthey are probably confined to their nests, a storeof provisions may be necessary for them.* Now,though the rainy season, at least in America, ashas been stated on a former occasions is aseason in which insects are full of life, yet theobservation, that ants may store up provisions inwarm countries, is confirmed by an account sentme by Col. Sykes, with respect to anotherspecies which appears to belong to the samegenus as the celebrated ant of visitations bywhich the houses of the inhabitants of Surinamwere said to be cleared periodically of theircock-roaches, mice, and even rats.^ The presentspecies has been named by Mr. Hope, the presidentants These ants, after long continuedrains during the monsoon, were found to bringup and lay on the surface of the earth, on a fineday, its stores of grass seeds, and grains ofGuinea corn, for the purpose of drying them*Many scores of these hoards were frequently oh*» See above, p. 239, 278, and Introdd, to Ent. il 62.« Ibid. 46. » See above, p. 250. < Acta cephaloUs.De Geer. iii. 607. ^ A. provides.INSECT CONDYLOPES. 345sensible on the extensive Parade at Poona.This account clearly proves that, where theclimate and their circumstances require it, theseindustrious creatures do store up provisions.From these very interesting communicationswe may remark how the functions of animals arevaried, the same function being often given incharge to tribes perfectly different in differentclimates. In temperate regions, the principalagents in disinfecting the air by devouring orremoving excrement, belong to the Order ofbeetles but in India, where probably more handsare wanted to effect this purpose of Providence,the tree-ants are called in to aid the beetles, bybuilding their nests of this fetid mortar, andthus clear the surface of innumerable nuisances,which probably soon dry and become scentless.In Europe, again, no ants are found to verifySolomon's observation, literally interpreted, butinIndia we see, and probably it may also be thecase in Palestine, provision for the future is notstored up solely by the bees, but the ants, whereit is necessary, are gifted with the same admirableinstinct.A circumstance here requires notice, which isalmost peculiar to the gregarious Hymenopteradwelling in a common habitation ; in all theircommunities, besides one or more prolific femalesand males, there is an order of sterilefemales, which have no connexion with the346 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.other Bex, and are solely employed in baboonand pursuits beneficial to the community atlarge to which they belong, especially the careand nurture of the young.The wisdom and beneficial effects of this law,by which the Creator has regulated their communities,and prescribed to all their duties andfunctions, must be evident tp every one. It setsfree the majority of the community to give theirwhole attention to those labours upon which thewelfare and existence of their several associationsdepend. Indeed, if they were all to beprolific, their societies would soon be dissolved,or destroyed by the evils attendant upon ansuperabundant population ; or their increasewould be so rapid, that the whole earth wouldsoon be covered by them, to the great annoyance,if not destruction, of the rest of its inhabitants.Now I am upon this subject, I may add a fewremarks upon the kindred societies of white-mti,which, though they belong to a different Order,are, in many respects, analogous to those of thetrue ants; and the differences observable betweenthem arise from a marked diversity in thenature of their metamorphosis ; namby, that inthe last named insects, both larves and pupesare incapable of locomotion, and all the laboursof the society, as well as its defence and the careand nurture of the young, are devolved upon adescription of its members that . are not giftedINSECT CONDYLOPES. 347with the faculty of reproduction : whereas, ia theformer, the white ants, the larves and pupes, inconformityto the law which, in this respect,regulates the Class to which they belong, arelocomotive and more active in those states thanin the last or reproductive one, and are thereforefully qualified to act in all the working depart-^meats, and to transact the general business ofthe society ; but as this, in their case, required aconformation of the head and oral organs inconsistentwith their use as offensive weaponsanother order was necessary to act as sentinels,and to be entrusted with the defence of the nestorterritory, as it is called, and its inhabitants.That such an order exists, we learn from thestatements of Smeathman and Latreille, who,both of them, had means of personal investigation,and the latter of whom brought to theinvestigation the deepest insight into his subject,and the most extensive knowledge of insects andtheir history possessed by any man in Europe.Upon the accuracy of his statements, therefore,the most entire reliance may be placed. Thespecies he investigated was discovered by himself,in the neighbourhood of Bordeaux, inhabitingthe trunks of firs and oaks, immediatelyunder the bark, where, without attacking thebark itself, they formed a great number of holesand irregular galleries. In these societies he^ Termes lucifuga.348 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.discovered, at all times, two kinds of individuals,which were without wings, elongated, soft, of ayellowish white, with their head, trunk, andabdomen distinct; they were active, furnishedwith six legs, their head large, and the eyes verysmall, or altogether wanting ; but, in one of thesekinds of individuals, which compose the bulk ofthe society, the head is rounded and the mandiblesnot extended ; while in the others, whichform not more than one twenty-fifth of the population,the head is much larger, elongated, andcylindrical, and terminated by mandibles thatextend from it and cross each other ; these La-triflealways found stationed at the entrance ofthe cavities where the others were assembled ingreatest numbers : towards the end of the winterand in the spring, he discovered individuals exactlyresembling those first mentioned, but havingthe rudiments of four wings, and in June,the same individuals had acquired four amplewings, had become of a blackish colour, andconsisted of males and females ; a month laterafew only were found in the territory, whichhad lost their wings, and eggs now begun toappear laid up in certain labyrinths of thewood.*It is clear from this account that those with around head and short mandibles are larves,1 Latreille in N.

N. xxxiii. 90.INSECT CONDYLOPES. 349which go through the usual metamorphosis oftheir tribe, not changing their form, but acquiringwings, first packed up in cases, andafterwards developed. The second description,with the elongated head and crossed mandibles,never acquired wings, and therefore correspondprecisely with the neuters amongst ants, onlyas Providence always economizes means, andwills that nothing be lost or wasted, he hasdecreed that these locomotive larves and pupesshould not live in idleness.Order 7. — ewe now come to an Order, takingtheir food by suction, which appear to have beenformed to deck our fields and groves with variousbeauty; but which in their first state,when they masticate their food, they mar anddestroy, often stripping the trees of their leavesand covering our hedges with their webs full ofcrawling myriads of devastations. It will be seenthat I am speaking of the Lepidopterous Order,consisting of three great phalanxes, the diurnalfliers, or butterflies the crepuscular fliers, orhawkmoths,^ the nocturnal fliers, or moths eachdivided into several genera. Their caterpillarsmost generally feed upon the foliage of vegetablesof every description ; but those of someof the lower tribes of moths devour animal substance,such as wool, fur, leather, grease, and the1 Papilio.

Their office seems tobe to keep in check too luxuriant vegetation,and, in many of the latter instances, the removingof dead animal matter, and every thingputrescent from the surface of the globe.But this is not the whole, they likewise hdpto maintain, as has been before observed,^ halfthe birds of the air, forming a principal portionof their food ; and in some countries, as well asthe locusts and white ants,* they are eagerlydevoured by man himself.

The montisof November, December, and January, are quitea season of festivity amongst these people, wkoassemble from every quarter to collect thesemoths. They are stated also to form the principalsummer food of those who inhabit to thesouth of the snow mountains. To collect thesemoths, or rather butterflies the natives makesmothered fires under the rocks on which theycongregate; and suffocating them with smokeSee above, p. 26. * Introdd. to Ent, I 303, 307.Wanderings, &c. i. 265. * Euplcea hamata, Mel.INSECT CONDYLOPES. 351collect them by bushels, and then bake them byplacing them on heated ground. Thus theyseparate from them the down and the wings,they are then pounded and formed into cakesresembling lumps of fat, and often smoked,which preserves them for some time. Whenaccustomed to this diet they thrive and fattenexceedingly upon it.^ Millions of these animalswere observed also, on the coast of New Holland,both by Captains Cook and King.' Thus has akind Providence provided an abundant supplyof food for a race that, subsisting solely byhunting or fishing, must often be reduced togreat straits.Orders 3 and 1 1 . — The masticating tribe, whichpresent the most striking analogy to the scaly-wingedlepidopterous insects, is one of verydifferent habits; mostly bold, rapacious, andsanguinary, they are perpetually chasing otherinsects, and devouring them, and this they do,not in one, but in all their states. I am speakinghere of the Neuropterous Order, especially thedragon flies, those insects of vigorous wing andindomitable force. Every one who comparesthese with the Heliconian butterflies, the wingsof which are sometimes, more or less, denudedof their scales,' will perceive that they are« Bennett, uH supr. 271. « ibid, 209, note ♦.3 £.

In digging upsome white ants' nests, in his garden at Poona,he once found two queens in one cell, a remarkableanomaly in their history. In the course ofthe present year I received a letter signed P. T.Baddeley, inclosing a drawing and specimens,of a singular species of white ant, with a headprecisely resembling that of an elephant, exceptthat there was no representation of the tusks.The head, which is enormously large comparedwith the size of the animal, terminates in a longproboscis. Mr. Baddeley found it in greatnumbers about two years ago, under some teaktimber; the only circumstance which he mentionsof its habits.Orders 8 and 9. — There are two Orders takingtheir food by suction, the Homoptera and Homoptera,which perhaps should rather be regardedas Sub-orders as Latreille considers them, andwhich were included by Linn in the same Orderwith the Orthoptera of modern entomologists, towhich, in fact, they are contrasted more or less.I shall therefore consider them together.The Homoptera are herbivorous, sucking theVOL.

The use of thearms and processes of the trunk, which arefound chiefly in the male, as well as in manymale Lamellicorn beetles,^ has not been satisfactorilyascertained ; but probably, like the hornsof quadrupeds, and the spurs of male gallinaceousbirds, they use them in their mutualbattles.One of these animals, as producing the mamaof the Pharmacopeia, may be regarded as ofsome use to mankind. And perhaps, in general,the tribe, in their perfect state, in which theyimbibe the juice of plants and trees, if not toonumerous, are probably of use to trees that areover vigorous, and full of sap. In their grubPhytamyza, plant-suckers.DynastcSf OfithophoffuSf Coptic &c.INSECT CONDYLOPES, 355state, in America, they are very injurious totimber, and fruit trees, into which they introducetheir eggs by a remarkable organ or ovipositor.The proper Hemiptera so called because theirwing-covers at the base are of a substanceresembling horn or leather, and are membranousat the tip, form the last victoriousOrder ; they are carnivorous, or more properly,animal'BvLcken ;* for though many of them arefound on particular trees and plants, it is not thejuices of these that they usually imbibe, butthose of the insects that frequent them ; there isone, however, too well known in this country, thebed-bug* which is more ambitious, extendingits attacks, like the flea, to the higher animals,being often found upon pigeons, upon rabbits,and more commonly infesting man himself,during his hours of repose. This Sub-order alsopresents a great variety of forms, and the bite ofsome is very venomous.The Junctions of these are similar to thoseof other Insects, that derive their nutrimentfrom the higher animals by sucking the bloodor juices ; but the bugs, being generally Insect-suckers,with their juices also suck away theirlives, and so are employed to diminish theirnumbers.

Now thecock-roach at this time found in Egypt* is blackwith the anterior margin of the thorax white, andthey never emerge from their hiding places tillthe evening both of which circumstances wouldfurnish a reason to the name given it ; and itmight be called the evening Insect, both from itscolour and the time of its appearance.There appears to be a striking analogicalresemblance between the bulk of the Orthopteraand Homoptera to the Reptiles^ particularly theJBatrachian ; their leaping and song are theprincipal points in which they agree, whence themembers of the latter Sub-order have usuallybeen called /rog'-hoppers, but in some of thegrass-hopper tribe there is also a singular coincidencein their form.*Gr.

In its generalaspect, though evidently belonging to the Arabians,it seems to represent the praying-insects,and the spectres ;' and, from its great flatness,it probably insinuates itself into close places,either for concealment or to he. in wait for itsprey.The splendid tribe of tiger-beetles,* as theyindicate by their fearful jaws, have the sameCarabus. * Mormolyce, Plate XI.

The grubsof these emulate spiders in some respects, lyingin wait for their prey in burrows in which theycuriously suspend themselves In the watersa considerable tribe of Beetles pursue variousaquatic insects, and by means of their mary hindlegs swim very swiftly, often suspending themselvesat the surface by their anal extremity, nearwhich are two large spiracles for respiration, forthey do not respire the water like fishes and thegrubs of Dragon-flies. Their larves are armedwith tremendous sickle-shaped jaws, throughwhich they pump the juices from fishes as wdlas insects.Besides those that are indiscriminate devourers,others confine themselves to particulartribes or species. Thus one of the most splendidof the, so called, ground-beetles named the sycophantsascends the trees and shrubs after thecaterpillars which are its destined food, andprobably other species of the genus have thesame commission. The rove-beetles bury themselvesin excrement in order to devour the grubsthat frequent it. I have before mentioned thewasp-beetle ; there are others which, in the sameway, attack those of the hive and other bees.*• Introdd. to Ent. iii. 152. « Calosama Sycophant.« Staphylinus.

The most destructive beetles in thesecountries are those that attack leather or skins.Two species of the same genus ^ commit dreadfulravages in the magazines of this article: and inspite of the constant pains that are bestowed toget rid of these insects and their grubs, greatlosses are suffered.Another unsightly substance is removed bynumberless beetles, whose office is that of sea*venders ; the celebrated Scarabaeus of the Egypt*tians,^ the symbol, as it is supposed, of the sun,is of this description ; the pill-beetle also,^equal in fame to the burying one, for trundlingits pills, each containing an egg, with the aid ofhis co-species : many of a smaller type are likerwise devoted to the same officesIt is worthy of remark that all these feed onlyon the excrement of herbivorous animals ; nonehaving been recorded, I believe, that feed onthat of cat-nivoraus ones, except a single species1 Dermestes cadaverous et vulpinus.« Scarab(BU$ sacer.^ Ateuchus pilularius, Introdd. to Ent. i. 351.♦ Spharidiuniy &c.^ Hybosorus geminatus.INSECT CONDYLOPES, 363that inhabits human excrement solely, but formsno burrow under it.Others of the order make a transition to thevegetable kingdom, by attacking various kindsof fungi, as agarics, Boleti, puff-balls, and thelike, which in fact seem to exhibit, in theirsubstance, some analogy to flesh. Fabriciushas given the name of Agaric-eater ^ to a genusthat is chiefly found in the Boletus; anotherbeetle, however, devours agarics, and is found, Ibelieve, in no other fungus and the puff-ballaffords a favourite nutriment to othersSome beetles, or tribes of beetles, are bothpredaceous, carnivorous, coprophagous, andfungivorous.

The connection of the first isINSECT CONDYLOPES. 369with the haves of the plant, to them they arecommitted by the mother as soon as they areextruded from her matrix, and they supply themwith their earliest and latest food ; but whenshe is disclosed in all her beauty, dressed asit were in her bridal robes, the connection isbetween her and the flowery her lovely analogue,from them she imbibes the sweet fluidwhich their nectaries Finish, and now, insteadof a devourer, she abstracts merely what isredundant, which, while it contributes to berown enjoyment and support, in the case ofthe bee, enriches man himself.We behold, then, this immense army of devourers,varying so infinitely in their instincts,as well as their forms, supplying many animalswith the whole of their substance, and forminga considerable portion of that of others, and feelconvinced that Providence has not placed themin their position, and given them such a varietyof organs, except with the view to some greatgeneral benefit to those animals amongst whomhe has placed them; and this benefit is notso much perhaps the reducing the numbers oftheir own class within due limits, though that isa most important object, as removing nuisances,which would deform, or in any way infect theearth and its inhabitants.

Fishes.Th£ animals we have hitherto considered havebeen destitute of an internal jointed vertebralcolumn and its bony appendages; and thoughsome, as the Cephalopods and some slugs havea kind of internal bone, and in one Order ofPolypes' the axis is sometimes articulated, yetthese, especially in the latter instance, merelyindicate an analogical relation, but no affinity.In none of these instances is this internal boneperforated for the passage of a spinal marrow,as in a real vertebrated column ; we now, however,enter that superior section of the animalkingdom, the individuals belonging to which,with scarcely any exception, are built uponthe column in question, increasing a spinal marrow,and terminated at its upper extremity by abony casket, calculated to contain and protectthe most precious and wonderful of all materialsubstances, the cerebral pulp, by which theorgans of sense perceive; the will moves themembers ; the mind governs the outward frame ;» Vol. i. p. 305. « Ibid. p. 177.372 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.and, in the king of animals, an immortal spirit,is enabled to seek and secure a higher destiny.This change in the juncture of animals wasrendered necessary by an increase in their fru/ft,for though there are some of the invertebratedSub-kingdom, as the fixed Polypes and severalof the Cephalopods, that are of as large dimensions,and a few of the vertebrate, as thehumming birds and the harvest mouse thatare not so large as some insects; yet the generalityof those distinguished by a vertebralcolumn form a striking contrast, as to magistide, with those that are not. Besides this,as these animals, by the will of their Creator,were to be endowed as they ascended in thscale, with gradually increasing intellectual faculties,it was necessary that the principal seatof those faculties should be differently organized.A different organ of respiration also, as well asof circulation, in the great body of vertebrates,required an internal cavity defended from theeffects of pressure.Having premised these general observations,we are next to consider what animals form thebasis of the vertebrated Sub*kingdom. Mostmodern zoologists appear to he of opinion thatthe Fishes occupy this position, and, taking allcircumstances into consideration, this seems the^ Trochilus. * Mus nestorius.FISHES. 373station assigned to them by their Creator ; stillthere are characters in some of the Reptiles thatseem to connect them more immediately withthe Insects. The metamorphoses, particularlyof the Batrachian Order, are of this description ;as is likewise the carapace, or shell (tf theChelonians, of which the vertebral column andribs form the basis. Those extraordinary animals,the hag and the lampreys half wormsand half fish, by means of the leech, evidentlyconnect the Fishes with the Annelidans.^ Perhapsthose butterflies of the ocean, the flyingfishes with their painted wing-fins withbranching rays, may look towards the Lepidopteraamongst Insects, but there is no directconnection at present discovered between thetwo Classes.The characters of the Class of Fishes are —Body with a vertebral column, covered withscales and moved by Jins. Respiration by permanentgills. Heart with only one auricle andone ventricle ; blood red, cold.Fishes are distinguished from the other vertebratedanimals, especially birds and beasts, bytheir mode of respiration ; the latter breathingthe atmospheric air, are furnished with lungs1 Gastrobranchus. {Myxine.

In the gillof a cod-fish, which I have just examinedunder a microscope, a vein and artery traverseeach plate longitudinally at the margin, whichappear to be pectinated, at right angles on eachside, with innumerable minute branches, and resemble,in this respect, the gills of Crustaceans.*Thus the blood is oxygenated by the airmixed with the water, and carried to the heart,whence it is distributed to the whole body.So that the aerated water produces the sameeffect upon the blood in the branchial vessels,as the air does upon that in our lungs.We know, by experience, how soon an animalthat breathes by lungs, if it remains only a fewminutes under water, and is cut off from allcommunication with the atmosphere, is suffocatedand dies; and that all aquatic animalsN.

Whence we may learn what anadmirable contrivance of Divine Wisdom is herepresented to us, to enable the infinite host offishes to breathe as easily in the water as wedo in the air.When we sum up all the diagnostics of theClass we are considering, we can trace, at everystep, so that, almost, he that runs may read. InfinitePower in the construction. Infinite Wisdomin the contrivance and adaptations, and InfiniteGoodness in the end and object of all the variousphysical laws, and in all the structures and organizationsby which they are severally executed,which strike the reflecting mind in this globe ofours. What else could have peopled the waters,and the air, with a set of beings so perfectly andbeautifully in contrast with each other, as thefishes and the birds. Sprung originally fromthe same element, they each move, as it were,in an ocean of their own, and by the aid ofsimilar, though not the same, means. Thegrosser element they inhabit required a differentset of organs to defend, to propel and guide, and tosink and elevate the fishy from what were requisiteto effect the same purposes for the hard,which moves in a rarer and purer medium ; yetas both were fluid mediums, consisting of the376 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.same elements, though differently combined;analogous organs, though differing in substance,structure, and number, were required. For whatdifference is there between swimming and flying,except the element in which these motionstake place ? The fish may be said to fiy in thewater y and the bird to swim in the air; butperhaps the movements of the aquatic animal,from its greater flexibility and the number of itsmotive organs, is more graceful and elegant thanthose of the aerial. The feathers of the one areanalogous to the scales of the other ; the wingsto the pector^l^it^; and the tail of both acts thepart of a rudder by which each steers itselfthrough the waves of its own element.One distinctive character of fishes is takenfrom the scales that cover and protect their softand flexile forms from injury. Scales, however,are not peculiar to fishes since many reptiles asthe Saurians, and some quadrupeds, as thePangolin,^ are armed by them. Scarcely anyspecies of fish is really without them* In some,upon which when living they are not discoverableunder a microscope, when they are dead,and the skin is dry, scales are readily detectedand detached. These organs vary greatly iaform : sometimes they resemble spines, at othersthey are tuberculated ; but most commonly theyMans,FISHES. 377aie plates, often carinated, and varying in shape,some being round, others royal, others againangular ; sometimes also they are finely denticulated.In some fish they are separated, inothers they touch, often so as to form togetherthe resemblance of a beautiful piece of mosaic,and in many they are imbricated.^ In thosethat rarely approach the shore, and are exposedonly to slight friction, they are fastened by asmaller portion of their circumference ; but inin-shore fishes they are more firmly fixed, andcovered partly by the epidermis, which, inthose that live and burrow in the mud, almostentirety envelopes them. Some fishes set upth spines like a hedgehog ; and most, whenalarmed, seem to have the power of erectingitem more or less. Had we the means of ascertainingthe situation and circumstances of everyindividual, we should find that, in every case,the figure and connexion, and substance of thescales, was ruled by them. A proof of this maybeseen in those fishes whose integument con-»sits of bard scales, united together so as to formatesselated coat of mail. I allude to theOstraeionsy whose organs of locomotion seem notcalculated to effect their escape when pursued ;the want of speed, however, is compensated bya covering that the teeth of few of their enemies» Roget, B. T, i. 116.378 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.can penetrate : the same remark applies to thosefishes that can inflate themselves into a globein some of which the fins are so minute, as tobe scarcely discoverable. In these the scalyspines, when erected, assist in preventing theattack of enemies.I have given a detailed account of the fins offishes on a former occasions I shall thereforehere only consider the motions of which they arethe organs, and their theatre.Though the hii^s-'\i we consider the wholeatmosphere of the globe, whether expanded overearth or sea, as their domain — may perhapshave a wider range than Xh^ fishes yet when wefurther consider that, besides the whole extentof the ocean, and the seas in connection with jL,with all its unfathomable depths and abysses,and all the rivers that flow into it — all the innumerablelakes also, and other stagnant waters onmountains, and at every other elevation, that theearth's surface contains, belong to the fishes,and compare at the same time the greatestdepth to which they descend with the greatestheight to which birds ascend, we may concludethat, with regard to its extent their habitableworld may be nearly commensurate with that oftheir rivals or analogues.As to their motions in their element, birds ofRoget, B. T. i. 433. « See above, p. 135.FISHES. 379the most rapid and unwearied wing must yieldthe palm to them ; the eagle to the shark, andthe swallow to the herring and salmon. Theform of fishes, generally speaking, is particularlycalculated for swift and easy motion ; andthe resistance of the fluid in which they moveseems never to impede their progress. Whilebirds that undertake long flights are oftenobliged to alight upon vessels for some rest andrenovation of strength, fishes never seem exhaustedby fatigue, and to require no respite orrepose. Sharks have been known to keep pacewith ships during long voyages ; and, like dogs,they will sport round vessels going at severalknots an hour, as if they had plenty of spareforce.* The tunny darts with the rapidity ofan arrow, and the herring goes at the rate ofsixteen miles per hour. But though manyfishes thus pursue an unwearied course withoutany intervals of repose, yet there are some thatoften appear to sleep. Inflating its natatory vesicle,our fresh-water shark, the pike, in the heatof the day, rises nearly to the surface, and thereremains perfectly motionless and apparentlyasleep: at this time he is easily snared, bypassing a running noose of wire over his tail, andby a sudden jerk bringing him on shore.The eye of fishes is like that of the higher> N.

One genus, however,removed from the gobiesy^ has theories ; and aspecies of bodian,^ from the equatorial seas, hada moveable membranous valve above each eye,with which, at will, it can cover it, that seemsanalogous to the latter. The eye of the eel, andother serpentiform fishes, which are usuallyburied and move about in the mud, is covered,through the provident care of their Creator, byan immoveable membrane ; and in several speciesthe organ can be withdrawn to the bottom ofthe socket, and even concealed, in part, under itsmargin. But the most singular kind of eye inthe Class, and that in which the forethought ofthe Deity is most conspicuous, is that of theAnablepsj a viviparous fish, inhabiting the riversof Surinam, and called by the natives the four-eyedfish. If the cornea of this eye be examinedattentively it will be found that it is divided intotwo equal portions, each forming part of an individualsphere, placed one above and the otherbelow, and united by a little narrow membranous,but not diaphanous, band, which is nearly horizontalwhen the fish is in its natural position ; ifPeriophthalmus^ ^ B, palpebratus.Wishes. 381the lower portion be examined, a rather largeiris and pupil will be seen, with a crystallinehumour under it, and a similar one with a stilllarger pupil in the upper portion. The object ofDivine Wisdom in this unparallelled structure, ifwe may conjecture from the circumstances of theanimal, is to enable it to see near and distantobjects at the same time — the little worms belowit that form its food, with one pupil and iris, andthe great fishes above it or at a distance, whichit may find it expedient to guard against, withthe other.The senses of smell and hearing have no externalavenue in fishes. The former is the mostacute of all their senses. Lacepede says it maybecalled their real eye, since by it they candiscover their prey or their enemies at an immensedistance ; they are directed by it in thethickest darkness, and the most agitated waves.The organs of this sense are between the eyes.The extent of the membranes on which the olfactorynerves expand, in a shark twenty-fivefeet long, is calculated to be twelve or thirteensquare feet.The teeth of fishes may be divided into thesame kinds as those of quadrupeds ; they havetheir january, incisive, and molars teeth ; theyare differently distributed, according to the speciesand mode of life ; some are almost immoveablefixed in bony sockets, others in membrane.FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.nous capsules, by which means tttey can be elevatedor depressed at the will of the animal*They not only have often many rows of teeth intheir mouth, but even their palate, their throat,and their tongue are sometimes thus armedAnd this accumulation of teeth is not confined tothe fiercest monsters of the deep, but even someherbivorous fishes have several rows of molarsteeth. An instance of this is afforded by a jawof some unknown fish, perhaps a Silurian, inmy possession, in which there are six rows ofsuch teeth, the anterior ones being somewhatconical. This specimen was found on the shoreof one of the lakes in Canada, and belonged to afish, which the friend who gave it to me statedwas much relished by the Indians.Many of the organs of the members of thisClass are more independent of each other thanthose of warm-blooded animals ; they seem lessconnected with common centres, in this respectresembling vegetables, for they may be morematerially altered, more desperately wounded,and more completely destroyed, without anymortal effect. Many of their parts, as the fins,if mutilated, can be reproduced. Indeed a fish,as well as a reptile, can be cut, torn, or dismemberedwithout appearing to suffer materially.The shark, from which a harpoon has taken a1 Plate XIII. Fio. 3.FISHES. 383portion of its flesh, pursues his prey with theusual avidity, if his blood has not been too muchexhausted. We see in this a merciful provision,that animals so much exposed to injury shouldsuffer less from it than those which are betterprotected, either by their situation or structure.Fishes are amongst the most long-lived animals.A pike was taken, in 1754, at Kaisersi-autem, which had a ring fastened to the gill-covers,from which it appeared to have been putinto the pond of that castle by the order ofFrederick the Second, in 1487, a period of twohundred and sixty-seven years. It is describedas being nineteen feet long, and weighing threehundred and fifty pounds 1 !Though the animals of the Class under considerationare not generally remarkable for theirsagacity, yet they are capable of instruction.Lacepede relates that some, which for more thanacentury had been kept in the basin of theTuileries, would come when they were called bytheir* names ; and that in many parts of Germanytrout, carp, and tench are summoned totheir food by the sound of a bellesAt the first blush it seems as if fishes tooklittle care or thought for their offspring; butwhen we inquire into the subject, we find themassiduous to deposit their eggs in such situations> Hist, des Poise, Introdd. xxx.384 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.as are best calculated to ensure their hatching,and to supply the wants of their young whenhatched; but sometimes they go further, andprepare regular fists for their young. Twospecies, called by the Indians, though of differentgenerals by the name of the flat-head andround-head hussars have this instinct, and constructa nest, the former of leaves and the latterof grass, in which they deposit their eggs, andthen cover them very carefully ; and both sexes,for they are monogamous, watch and defendthem till the young come forth. General Hard-wickedmentions a parallel instance in the ffo-ramyty^ of the Isle of France, a fish of the size ofthe turbot, and superior to it in flavour, cultivatedin the ponds of that island.It has been observed that some fishes, whesidead, emit a phosphoric light, I have particularlynoticed this in the mackarel, but others do thiswhen living. The sun-fish which sometimes hasbeen found of an enormous bulks when swimmingyields a light, which looks like the reflectionof the moon in the water, whence it has alsobeen called the moon-fish — and the spectator invain searches for that planet in the heavens.Sometimes many individuals swim together, and^ Dorass and Callicthys,Osphromenus olfax. ^ Mole.^ One is said to have been caught in the Irish sea twenty-fivefeet long! ! — Lacepp. Hist* 51 UFIHH£». 385by their multiplied luminous disks, generally atsome distance* compose a singular and startlingspectacle ; and if we take into considerationthe magnitude p{ these animals we may conceivethe wonder and amazement that wouldagitate the mind of any one when he first beheldsuch an army of great lights moving through thewaters. For what purpose Providence has giftedthe sua-fish with this property, and how it isproduced, has not been ascertained. It mayeither be for defence, or illumination.Few animals, with regard to magnitude, presentto the eye such enormous masses as somefishes ; leaving the whales out of the question,]irhich though aquatic, belong to another Class,what quadruped can compete with the sharkswhich is also a phosphoric fish. That tribecalled by the French Reqnins^ which is thoughtto be synonymous with the Zacharias of theGreeks, and one of which was probably the sea-monster,mistranslated the whahy which swallowedthe disobedient prophet — are stated toexceed thirty feet in length; another' of a differenttribe is still larger, sometimes extendingto the enormous length of more than/orty feet 1 !^Next to the sharks, the rcofs^ nearly akin tothem, exceed in their magnitude ; they are someHist, of Waterford, 271.

An individualof a species of this tribe, called by the sailors thesea-devil, taken at Barbadoes, was so large, as torequire seven pairs of oxen to draw it on shore ! ! *If we consider the vast tendency to increase ofthe oceanic tribes, that where a terrestrial animalgives birth to a single individual, a marine oneperhaps produces a million, we may conceivethat if no check was provided to keep theirnumbers within due limits, they would so fill thewaters as to interfere with each other's and thegeneral welfare. The Cod-fish alone, which,according to Leeuwenhoek and Lacepede,^ producesmore than nine millions of eggs in oneyear, if neither man, nor shark nor other predaceousfish, made it their food, would so fill theocean in congenial climates, in the course of nolong period of time, that there would scarcely bespace for the motions or life of any other marineanimal : the same may be said of almost allthe migratory fishes. In these circumstanceswe see the reason why such enormous monsterswere created that could swallow them by hundreds,why their yawning mouth and throat were^ Rata Banksiana,« Lacepp. Hist, des Poise. ii. 1 16.Leeuwenh. £past. iii. 188.

Cold-blooded animals, as I latelyobserved, do not suffer from the various dismembermentto which their situation exposesthem, like those of a higher and warmer temperature,whence we may conclude, that great painand anguish are not felt by them .Another function of these tremendous animalsis to devour all carcasses ^ which, from whatevercause, are floating in the water, thus they actthe same part in disinfecting and purifying theocean, that the hyenas and vultures, their terrestrialanalogues, and other animals, do upon earth.Another lesson may be learned from the existenceof these terrible monsters ; for if God fittedthem to devour, he fitted them also to instruct.The existence of creatures so evil, and suchrelentless destroyers of his works in the materialworld, teach us that there are probably analogousbeings in the spiritual world ; and whatoccasion we have for watchfulness, to escapetheir destructive fury.There is nothing more remarkable in the Class388 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.we are considering than the infinite variety andsingularity of the figures and shapes of fishes.It has been thought that the ocean containsrepresentatives of every terrestrial and aerialform. However this be, it may be asserted thatthe forms of fishes are more singular and extraordinary,more grotesque, and monstrous, tianthose of any other department of the animalkingdom ; but on this subject I need not enlarge.Having made these general remarks uponfishes, I shall next say something on their Classification.Of all the Classes of animals, that ofFishes, as Baron Cuvier observes, is the most difficultto divide, into Orders. Linn consideredwhat have been usually denominated Carthage'nam Fishes as forming a section of his but the. former illustrious naturedly hasvery judiciously arranged them with the fishes.Mythologists in general agree with Cuvier individing this Class into two Sub-classes—viz.Osseansj in which the skeleton is hcm^ and formedof holy fibres ; and Cartilagineans, in which it iscartilaginous and formed of calcareous grt^nS'Lacepede, the most eminent of modern Mythologists,has observed that there is a strikingresemblance or analogy between certain points ofthese two Sub-classes, of which he has given atable drawn up in a double series, which I shallhere subjoin.Nantes.FISHES. 389CARTILA0INEAN8.

Silures,Cuvier also remarks, with respect to the animalsof the present Clads, that they form twodistinct series which in another place he says,cannot be considered as either superior orinferior to each other.Many genera of the Cartilagineans, he thinks,approach the Reptiles by some parts of theirorganization, whilst it is almost doubtful whetherothers do not belong to the Invertebrates.^ Hehas made no remark with respect to the connectionof the Osseans with the above Class : thoughhis thirteenth Family consists of fishes thathave always gone by the name oi Jishing-frogSy*from the resemblance which they exhibit to thatanimal, and from their pectoral fins assumingthe appearance of legs.* The species of onegenus resemble a fish with a lizard on its back,the head being overshadowed by a conicalhorizontal horn, in the sides of which theeyes are fixed, so that the lower lobe simulates> Rkgne Anim. ii. 128. < Ibid. 376.« Lophius.

Agassiz, who is reported to have undertakenit, and in the mean time, give a popular summaryof Baron Cuvier's Orders, as I find them in thelast edition of the Rhgne Animal.Sub'Class 1. — The Cartilaginous which, asallied to the Annelidans, I shall place first, aredivided by Cuvier into three Orders,* viz. theCyclostameSy or suckers ; the Selacians ; and theSturionians.Order 1. — The CychstomeSy or suckers, withregard to their skeletons, are the most imperfectof all the Vertebrates, They have neitherpectoral nor ventral fins.

Bymeans of their mouth, which, as well as thetongue, is armed with teeth, they fix themselvesto fishes, and derive their nutriment from them.The lamprey lampeme^ and hags &c. belong tothis Order.Orde* 2. — ^^The Selacians have gills, fixed bytheir outer margin, and not disengaged as in theOsseans, and they expel the water by lateralopenings. To this Order the sharks and therays belong.Order 3. — ^^The Sturianians agree with ^^TheOssian Fishes in their gills, but their skeletonis cartilaginous. They have only a single orifice,covered with an operculum. The solegenera included in this Order are the Sturgeonand the Sea-ape.*Sfd^'Class 2. — The Osseans Cuvier divides intofour Orders, viz Acanthopterygians^ Malacop-terygians, LophobranchianSy and Plectognathians.These Orders, for reasons before assigned Ishall reverse.Order 1.

We cannot dip beneaththe waves, to visit the depths of the ocean, thatwe may investigate their manners and history;but, doubtless, we may conclude, that the sameWisdom, Power, and Goodness, which we findso visibly manifested in the structure and operationsof all the animals that are under oureyes and inspection, have equal place and areequally conspicuous, when brought into view, inthe marine and other aquatic animals. Weknow by experience that a large portion of themare of the greatest benefit to mankind, and therest, from the gigantic shark to the pigmy minnow,each in their place, and engaged in thefulfilment of their several functions, are, we mayconclude, equally beneficial, though in a waythat we cannot fully appreciate.I have had more than one occasion to enlai^upon some of those parts of the history of fishesScomber Scombrus. ^ Trigla Oumardus,^ Nullus, ♦ Perca.FISHES. 395with which we are acquainted I shall thereforeonly add here some particulars with respectto the habits of a few individuals which maythrow some light upon their history.Amongst the Cyclostomous Cartilagineans thehag is distinguished by a singular means ofescape from its enemies. This animal adheresto fishes by creating a vacuum by means ofits lips; this effected, it lacerates them withits teeth, without their being able to shake it off,and then, like the leech, it sucks their blood andjuices; but since, when thus fixed and enjoyed,it might easily become the prey ofother fishes, Providence has enabled it to concealitself fipom them, by means of the excrementwhich, when in danger, it emits, andwhich remains for a time near it, detained bythe slime which exudes from its pores. Thisis so abundant that Kali, having put one inalaisse tub of sea water, it became like a cleartransparent glue, from which he could drawthreads, even moving the animal with them.A second water, upon its being again immersed,in a quarter of an hour, became the same. Sir£. Home was of opinion that these animals arehermaphrodites.Amongst all the diversified faculties, powers,« Vol. I. 106—124.396 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.and organs, with which Supreme Wisdom hasgifted the members of the animal kingdom todefied themselves from their enemies, or to securefor themselves a due supply of food, noneare more remarkable than those by which theycan gives them an electric shock, and arrestthem in their course, whether they are assailantsor fugitives. That God should arm certainties,in some sense, with the lightning of the cloudsand enable them thus to employ an elementso potent and irresistible, as we do gunpowder,to astound, and smite, and stupid, and kittleinhabitants of the waters, is one of thosewonders of an Almighty arm which ao terrestrialanimal is gifted to exhibit. For though somequadrupeds, as the cat, are known, at certaintimes, to accumulate the electric fluid in theirfur, so as to give a slight shock to the hand thatstrokes them, it has never been clearly ascertainedthat they can employ it to arrest orbewilder their prey, so as to prevent their escape.Even man himself, though he can chargehis batteries with this element, and again dischargethem, has not yet so subjected it tohis dominion, as to use it independently of othtfsubstances, offensively and defensively, as theelectric fishes do.The fishes hitherto ascertained to possess thispower belong to the genera Terrorem, Triehi-Fishes. 307vmSf Malapterurus, Gymnotus^^ and Raia.^ Themost remarkable are the three last.The faculty of the Torpedo to benumb itsprey was known to Aristotle,' and Pliny furtherstates:* that conscious of its power, it hidesitself in the mud, and benumbs the unsuspectingfishes that swim over it. The Arabians, whenthey cultivated the sciences so successfully,had observed this faculty both in the Torpedotad the Malapterurus, and perceiving an affinitybetween the electric fluid of the heavens andthat of these fishes, called them Raash,^ a nameSignifying thunder.The electric organ in the Malapterurus^ extendsall round the animal, immediately underthe skin, and is formed of a mass of cellulartissue, so condensed and thick as, at first, tohook like bacon ; closely examined, it is found toconsist of tendinous fibres, which are interlacedtogether, so as to form a net work, the cellsof which are filled with a gelatine-albuminoussubstance, the whole accompanied by a nervousSystem, differing from that of the Torpedo andElectric-eel, and similar to that of other fishes J> The trivial name of the first four of these species iselectricus,R, Torpedo. 3 Hist.

Ann. du Mat. i. 402.398 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.This organ is divided into two portions by alongitudinal septum.The Torpedo is the most celebrated of theelectric fishes. In this the organ of its powerextends, on each side, from the head and gills tothe abdomen, in which space it fills all theinterior of the body. Each organ is attached tothe parts that surround it, by a cellular membraneand by tendinous fibres. Under the skinwhich covers the upper part of these organs, aretwo bands, one above the other, the upper oneconsisting of longitudinal fibres, and the lower oftransverse ones. The latter continues itself inthe organ by means of a great number of membranouselongations, which form many-sidedvertical bodies, or hollow polygonal tubes, somehexagonal, others pentagonal, and others quadrangular; each of these tubes is divided, internally,by a fine membrane into several dissepi-ments, connected by blood-vessels. In each ofthe organs, from two hundred to twelve hundredof these tubes have been counted in individualsof different age and size, some regularbut others irregular, which may form electricbatteries. Each organ is also traversed by arteries,veins, and nerves, in every direction,which last are remarkable for their size. Thetubes, like those above mentioned, are alsofound in the non-electric Rays, but these terminatein pores without the skin, which are soFISHES. 399many excretory organs of the matter containedin their interior ; in the Torpedo, on the contrary,the tubes are completely closed, not onlyby the skin which is no where perforated, butfurther by the aponeuroses, or tendinous expansionsof the muscles, which extend all overthe electric organ; the gelatinous matter notbeing able to expand itself externally, is forcedto accumulate in these tubes, from whencedoubtless arises their size and their progressivenumerical increase. The two surfaces of theelectric organ are supposed to be one positiveand the other negative. Reaumur observed thatthe back of the animal is rather convex, butwhen about to strike its convexity diminishes,and it becomes concave, but after the strokeit resumes its convexity. These organs not onlyaffect the animals upon which they act, byan agency imperceptible to the eye, but they arealso stated to emit sparks ; and they can strikeat some distance, as well as by immediate contact.The author last named put a torpedo anda duck into a vessel filled with sea water, andcovered it to prevent the escape of the latter,which, after about three hours, was found dead.These wonderful and complex organs, and theirmany-haled batteries, the effect of which hasattracted the notice of scientific men for so longa period, were doubtless given to these animalsby their Creator, in lieu of the offensive and400 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.defensive arms which enable the rest of tktirtribe to act the part assigned to them, that theirmight procure the means of subsistence, and todefend themselves when in danger. Almostalways concealed in the mud, like most ofthe rays they can by this weapon kill the smallfishes that come within the sphere of theiraction, or benumb the large ones ; if they arein danger of attack £rom any voracious fish,they can disable him by invisible blows, more tobe dreaded than the teeth of .the shark itsdf.The Gymnotus, or electric ed, is a still mitretremendous assailant, both of the inhabitants ofits own element, and even of large quadrupeds,and of man himself if he puts himsdf in tiway. Its force is said to be ten times greaterthan that of the torpedo. This animal is anative of South America. In the imm^ifleplains of the Llanos, in the province of Caracas,is a city called Calabozo, in the vicinityof which these eels abound in small streams,insomuch that a road formerly much frequentedwas abandoned on account of them, it beingnecessary to cross a rivulet in which many makewere annually lost in consequence of their ait*tack. They are also extremely oonunofi inevery pond from the equator to the 9th degreeof north latitude.Contrary to what takes place in the torpedo,the electric organs of the Gymnotu$ are placedWishes. 401wider the tot, in a place removed from the vitaleyes. It has/oter of these organs, two large andtiro small, which occupy a third of the wholefish : each of the larger organs extends from theabdomen to the tail ; they are separated fromeach other above by the dorsal muscles, in themiddle of the body by the natatory vesicle, andbelow by a particular septum. The smalloigans lie over the great ones, finishing almostat the same point; they are pyramidal, andseparated from the others by membrane. Theinterior of all these organs presents a greatnumber of horizontal septa, cut at right anglesby others nearly vertical. John Hunter countedthirty-four in one of the great organs, and fourteenin one of the small ones, in the same individual.The vertical septa are membranous,and so close to each other that they appear totouch. It is by this vast quadruple apparatus,which sometimes in these animals is calculatedto equal one hundred and twenty-three squarefeet of surface, that they can give such violentshocks. Mr. Nicholson thought that the Gym-artuscould act as a battery of 1,125 square feet.Humboldt says that its galvanic electricityproduces a sensation which might be calledspedficaUy different from that which the conductorof an electric machine, or the Leydenphial, or the pile of Volta, cause. Fromplacing his two feet on one of these fishes justVOL. II. D I)402 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.taken out of the water, he received a shockmore violent and alarming than he ever experiencedfrom the discharge of a large Ladenjar ; and for the rest of the day he felt an acutepain in his knees, and almost all his joints.Such a shack, he thinks, if the animal passedover the breast and the abdomen, might bemortal. It is stated that when the animal istouched with only one hand the shock is gaslight; but when two hands are applied at asufficient distance, a shock is sometimes given sopowerful as to affect the arms with a pantyaisfor many years. It is said that females, underthe influence of a nervous fever, are not affected.Humboldt gives a very spirited account of themanner of taking this animal, which is done bycompelling twenty or thirty wild horses andmules to take the water. The Indians soirouwlthe basin into which they are driven, armedwith long canes, or harpoons ; some mount thetrees whose branches hang over the water, aUendeavouring by their cries and > instruments tokeep the horses from escaping : for a long timethe victory seems doubtful, or to incline to ib»fishes. The mules, disabled by the frequencyand force of the shocks, disappear under diewater ; and some horses, in site of the aclifevigilance of the Indians, gain the banks, mdovercome by fatigue, and benumbed by theshocks they have encountered, stretch tfaMi-FISHES. 4038ely€s at their length on the ground. Therecould not says Humboldt, be a finer subject forapainter: groups of Indians surrounding thebison ; the horses, with their hair on end, andtertio and agony in their eyes, endeavouring toexcise the tempest that has overtaken them ;the eels, yellowish and livid, looking like greataquatic spent, swimming on the surface ofthe water in pursuit of their enemy.In a few minutes two horses were alreadydrowned: the eel, more than five feet long,gliding under the belly of the horse or mule,made a discharge of its electric battery on thewhole extent, attacking at the same instant theheart and the viscera. The animals stupefiedby these repeated shocks, feel into a pcolbuwllethargy, and, deprived of all sense, sink underthe water, when the other horses and mulespassing over their bodies, they are soon drowned.The Gh/nmoti having thus discharged theiraccumulation of the electric fluid, now becomeharmless, and are no longer dreaded: swimminghalf out of the water, they flee from thehorses instead of attacking them ; and if theyenter it the day after the battle, they are notmolested, for these fishes require repose andplenty of food to enable them to accumulatea sufficient supply of their galvanic electricity.It is probable that they can act at a distance,and that their electric shock can be communisFUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.crosses the paddy Fields from one creek to another,often a quarter of a mile asunder.

I have bore alluded to their connectionwith the Reptiles f in some points also theylook to the rays and the sharks.

There are predaceous fishes to keepthe aquatic population of every description withindue limits ; there are others whose office it is toremove nuisances arising from putrescent substances,whether animal or vegetable ; and lastly,there are others which, like our herds and flocks,are peaceful and gregarious, and graze theherbage of sea weeds that cover the ocean's bed.All these, in their several stations, and by theirseveral operations, glorify their Almighty Authorby fulfilling his will.Chapter XXII.Functions and Instincts. Reptiles.In the whole sphere of animals, there are none,that, from the earliest ages, have been moreabhorred and abominated, and more repudiatedaft maclean and hateful creatures, than the majorityof the Class we are next to enter upon, —that of Reptiles. One Order * of them, indeed,consisting of the turtles and tortoises, and someindividuals belonging to another's are exemptedfrom this sentence, and are regarded with morefavourable eyes ; but the rest either disgust usby their aspect, or terrify us by their supposedor real power of injury.In Scripture, the serpent ; the larger Saurians^under the names of the dragon and leviathan ;and frogs are employed as symbols of the evilspirit, of tyrants and persecutors, and of thefalse prophets that incite them.'The Caledonians.< The Geckoy Monitor, Chameleon, &c. amongst the Syrians.» Joy xli. 34 ; Psl. xxvii. 1 ; Ezek. xxv. 3 ; Rev. xx. 2,xvi. 13.410 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.Yet these animals exhibit several extraordinarycharacters and qualities. They areendued with a degree of vivaciousness thatno others possess: they can endure dismembermentand privations which would expel thevital principle from any creature in existenceexcept themselves. Their life is not so concentratedin the brain, which with them is extremelyminute, but seems more expanded overthe wh<de of their nervous system : take outtheir brain or their heart, and cut off their head,yet they can still move, and the heart will evenbeat many hours after extraction ; it is also statedthat they can live without food £eNr months, andeven yearsBut though gifted by their Creator with sucha tenacity o£ life yet is that life often raised avery few degrees above death. Many of themselect for their retreats damp and gloomy cargems and vaults, shut out from the access of thelight and air. In allusion to this circumstance,Babylon, the imperial city, she, who in ancienttimes subjected the eastern world to her damnation,was forewarned that she should heeomheaps, and a dawdling-place for dragons.'Whether the many instances that have beenrecorded in different countries, of toads found1 Cuv.

Though so given to withdraw themselvesinto dark and dismal retreats, yet many ofthem are fond also of basking in the sun-beam,particularly the serpents and the lizards.Zoologists seem not even yet fully to havemade up their minds with regard to the classificationof Reptiles. linn placed them in the sameClass ^ with the Cartilaginous Fishes, of whichthey form his first and second Orders ; but subsequentzoologists, with great propriety, havegenerally considered them as forming a Class bythemselves, under their primeval name of Reptiles.This Class M. Brongniart divided into fourOrders, viz. Cbehnians^ Saurians^ OpiidianSf andBatrachians: and Baron Cuvier has followed^ Amphibia,412 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.this arrangement in his Rhgne Animal. La-trifle,adopting the Group, has divided it intotwo Classes, Reptiles and Amphibians. TheReptiles he considers as forming two Sub-classes,viz* Cataphracta^ containing the ChelonianSj andCrocodiles and Squamosa containing the remainingSaurians and the Ophidians. His secondClass, the Amphibians consisting of theBatrachians of Brongniart, with the addition ofthe Proteus Siren, &c. he divides into twoTribes, viz. Caducibranchiaj or the proper and Perennibranchia, or the ProteusSiren, Axolot, &c. This classification is adoptedby Dr. Grant,* except that he does not subdividethe Reptiles into two Sub-classes ; andLatreille's two Tribes of Amphibians he properlydenominates Orders.That Reptiles, in the larger sense of the term,form a natural Group, will be generally admitted,when it is considered that the salamanders, ornaked efts, evidently connect the Batrachianswith the Saurians, and were formerly consideredas a kind of lizard; it seems to me thereforemore consistent with nature to consider theReptiles as forming a single Class.This opinion has received strong confirmationfrom a circumstance communicated to me bymy kind friend Mr. Owen, well known as one ofOutlines of a Course of Lectures, &c. 14 — 16.REPTILES. 413our most eminent comparative anatomists. Inaletter received from him, since I wrote thepreceding paragraph, in reply to some queriesI had addressed to him, he says, — '^ I lose notime in replying to your very welcome letter,because I have a statement to make whichjustifies your disinclination to regard the Reptiliaof Cuvier as including two distinct Classes.Not any of the Brachia have a single auricle ;for though the venous division of the heart hasasimple exterior, it is in reality divided internallyinto two separate auricles, receiving respectively,the one, the carbonized blood of thegeneral system, the other and smaller, theaerated, or vital, blood from the lungs. This Ihave found to be the case successively in thefrog and toad, the salamander and newt, andlastly, in the lowest of the true Amphibia, theSiren lacerta, which in its persistent externalbranchiae comes nearest, I apprehend, to theFishes."By this statement it appears that those characters,which have been deemed sufficient towarrant the division of the Reptiles into twodistinct Classes, exist only in appearance. Ishall consider them therefore as forming onlyanCj of which the following seem to constitute theprincipal diagnostics.414 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.Reptilia.

The Cecilia or blindserpent, too, is almost inarticulate, and hasonly some transverse rows of scales between thewrinkles of its skinsFrom this statement, it seems that 1)ie Classof Reptiles is connected with the Fishes, not bythose at the top of the latter Class, but by those.* R^gne Anim. ii. 99.REPTILES. 4]7at its base ; with the Osseans by the Pods, andwith the Cartilagineans by the Cyclostomes ; sothat they may be almost regarded as forming aparallel line with them, instead of succeedingthem in the same series. Even the properBatrachians seem to tend to the Chelonians,while the Salamanders look to the Saurians.The great body of the Class are predaceous,subsisting upon various small animals, especiallyinsects, and some Ophidians upon largeones; but the Chelaniatts seem principally toderive their nutriment from marine and othervegetables, though some of these will devourMolluscans, worms, and small reptiles: theTrianon ferox will attack and master evenaquatic birds.

The animal I allude to is the Proteusbelonging to the present Order, which wasfirst found thrown up by subterranean watersin Camilla, as we are informed by the late SirH. Davy,* by Baron Lois. Sir Humphrey himselfappears to have found them in the Grottoof the Maddalena, at Adelsburg, several hundredfeet below the surface of the earth; he alsostates that they have been found at Sitting,thirty miles distant, and he supposes that thosefound in both places might be thrown up bythe same subterranean lakes In the year 1833there were two living specimens in the museumof the Zoological Society, where I had the pleasureof seeing them ; and from one of them theaccurate figure at the end of this vcdume,* by» Vol. I. p. 35. « Console in Tray. 187.» Ibid. 188-^188. * PiATB XIV. Flo. 1.REPTILES. 419the kind permission of the Society, was takenby Mr. C. M. Curtis.Wh^i we look at these animals, there is somethingso different in their general aspect from thetribes to which they are most nearly related thatthe idea strikes one that we are viewing beings&r removed from those that inhabit the surfcu^eof our globe, and its waters; which, thoughaccidentally visiting these upper regions, maybethe outsiders of a population still furtherremoved from our notice, and dipping deeperinto its interior.The Proteus is about a foot in length, orsomething more, and about an inch in thickness;the body is cylindrical, tapering to thetfdl ; its colour is a pale red ; its skin is transparentand slimy, so as easily to elude the grasp.It has four short slender legs, the anterior pairplaced just behind the head, having three, andthe posterior pair, which are shorter, and placedjust before the vent, having only two toes withoutclaws. The head terminates in a fiat, veryobtuse muzzle, somewhat resembling the beak ofa duck ; its maxillse are armed with teeth ; theeyes are extremely minute, and scarcely discernible;they are concealed, and apparentlyrendered useless by an opaque skin ; but as thisanimal is said to avoid the light, it is evidentthat it produces some effect upon them ; behindthe head, on each side, is an opening like those420 Functions AND Instincts.of fishes, over which are the gills, divided intoseveral branches It has, besides, an internalpneumatic apparatus, consisting of two vesicles,below the heart. The tail is compressed, furnishedabove and below with a caudal fin, extendingto the posterior legs. Its l^s, fromtheir having no claws, are, it is probable, principallyuseful in walking upon the mud, and bymeans of its caudal fin it can move like an eelor fish in the water. From a small shell-fishbeing found in the stomach of one, it seems iofollow that its food, at least in part, consists ofMoUuscans inhabiting the same subterraneaneaves and waters with itself, and probablydistinct from any of those to which the atmospherehas free access. Sometimes, elevating itshead above the water, it makes a hissing noiselouder than could be expected from so small ananimal.Before quitting this subject, I may observethat Baron Humboldt has given an account of awonderful eruption of subterranean fishes whichsometimes takes place from the volcanos of thekingdom of Quito. These fishes are ejected inthe intervals of the igneous eruptions, in suchquantities as to occasion putrid fevers by themiasmata they produce : they sometimes issuedfrom the crater of the volcano, and sometimes« Plate XIV. Fio. 1, a.Reptile. 421from lateral clefts, but constantly at the elevationof between two and three thousand toises abovethe level of the sea. In a few hours, millionsare see) to descend from Cotopaxi, with greatmasses of cold and fresh water. As they do notappear to be disfigured or mutilated, they cannotbe exposed to the action of great heat.Humboldt thought they were identical withfishes that were found in the rivulets at the footof the volcanos. These fishes belong to a genusseparated from Silutms.^Order 2. — This Order begins with two genera,the species of which have been supposed to breatheby lungs only, no traces of gills having yet beendiscovered in any individual belonging to them.Cuvier thinks that they cast them sooner thanthe salamanders. One of these is a large. animal,^being more than a yard in length ; it undiscoveredby Dr. Garden, in South Carolina:like the Proteus, its eyes are covered with athick tunic, and its toes have no claws. Theothers found in New York, comes near thesalamanders, and has been called by Americanwriters the giant salamander. Both are foundin fred-water lakes, and similar places.I have mentioned, on a former occasion, asalamander that lays her eggs singly on the1 Pimelodus, Humboldt names the species id question P,Cyclops, ZooL 22.^ Amphibia means. ' Menopoma.422 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.leaves of Persicaria which she doubles downover theirs and which are kept folded hymeans of the glue that envelopes the egg. Dr.Rusconi, to whom we are indebted for thishistory, observed the whole progress and developmentof this animal, from its embryostate in the egg. It is at first opaque, formed ofa soft homogeneous substance. Almost as soonas it has escaped from Its envelope, it becomesgradually transparent, so that the successivedevelopements, both of its internal and externalorgans, may be discerned — the heart, and itssystole and diastole ; the stomach, its form andposition; the intestinal canal, which at firstextends in a straight line, from one end of theabdomen to the other, and then begins to undulate,and ends by forming many convolutions:next may be seen the liver, the development ofwhich keeps pace with that of the stomach andintestines ; and lastly appear the lungs, takingtheir place and form, always filled with air, andso transparent that one might believe the animalhas on each side of the trunk a bubble of airgradually dilating and lengthening. When allthese organs have acquired the necessary development,the spectator beholds in the littlecreature the beginning, as it were, of its animalSec above, p. 265,REPTILES. 423life. ItB former life being merely organic, resemblingthat of a vegetable, but now its motionsare become the result of its sensations andWe see in this instance how exactly the rudiments,as it were, of the organs of the futureanimal, are fitted to respond to the action of theelements upon them, how the germe of everyorgan begins, if I may so speak, to vegetate, andgrows till it is fully developed, so as to becomeeither a fit instrument of the will or of the vitalpowers, and adapted to carry the creaturethrough all its destined operations, and to enableand incline it to fulfil all its prescribedfunctions. These observations, and this interestinglittle history, will apply to man himself,who, in his embryo state, is the subject ofsimilar developements ; and the words of thedivine Psalmist are a beautiful comment uponthis our embryo life : For thou hast possessed myreins : thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.My substance was not hid from thee when I wasmade in secret ^ and curiously wrought in thelowest parts of the earth. Thine eyes did see mysubstance yet being imperfect ; and in thy book allmy members were written which in continuance1 Rnsconi, in Edith, Philos, Joum. ix. 110 — 113, on Salamandraplatycauda.424 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.wei^e fashioned tvJien as yet that was nous ^themThe salamander as is reported, says Aristotle;,if it goes through fire extinguishes it :' this isrepeated by Pliny, who adds, that it extinguishesit like ice. It never appears, he further observes,except in showery weather, and likewise thatit emits a milky saliva, which is depilatory.^Salamanders, says Boscc, emit from their skin alubricating white fluid when they are annoyed,and if they are put into the fire, it sometimeshappens that this fluid extinguishes it sufficientlyto permit their escape; and again — when onetouches the terrestrial salamander, it causes totransmute from its skin a white fluid, which itsecretes more copiously than its congeners.This kind of milk is extremely acrid, and producesa very painful sensation upon the tongue.According to Gesner, it is an excellent depilatory.It is sometimes spirted out to the distanceof several inches, as Latreille has observed,and diffuses a particularly nauseous scent; itpoisons small animals, but does not appear toproduce serious effects upon large onesI have introduced these ancient and modernstatements to show how little they differ, and i)confirmation of the truth of them I have a re» P5. xxxix. 13—16. a Hx&t, An. lib. v. chap. 19.3 Hut.

Upon examineing the pail they found one of these efts, as theycalled them, running round very quickly amongstthe frogs, each of which, when touched by it,died instantaneously, in the manner abovestated. They afterwards regarded these efts,as may be supposed, with nearly as muchhorror as they would a rattlesnake ; and a fewnights afterwards, finding one in the kitchen,it was seized with the tongs, and thrown into agood fire which was burning in the grate. Thereptile, instead of perishing, slipped like lightningthrough the coals, and ran away under thefireplace apparently unhurt. The house, inwhich these animals were found, was in a re*maikably damp situation.If our northern salamanders are gifted withsuch powerful means of offence or defence, weknow not how far those powers may be sublimed426 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.in the species of wanner climates ; and the frequentingand death-doing properties of theGrecian or Roman salamanders may approachnearer to the, supposed, fabulous descriptions ofAristotle and Pliny, than modem Herpetologistsseem willing to believe.There appears no small analogy between theseproperties considered as weapons, and means bywhich these animals eith^ secure their prey,consisting of earth-worms, insects, and odersmall game, or disarm and destroy their enemies,and those, related in the last chapter, whichdistinguish the electric fishes.Spallanzani, by numerous experiments, hasdiscovered in this tribe of animals, the powerof reproducing lost or mutilated organs ; Bennetand others have confirmed his observations. Sothat it seems proved, if their legs and tail arecut off, and even their eyes plucked out, that inafew months they will be reproduced ; and evena limb thus renewed, if again cut off, will bereproduced again.In going upwards from the salamanders, atfirst sight, we feel disposed to proceed next tothe other animals of a similar form, the lizardsand other Saurians, for this way their externalform leads us, but their internal organization isnearer that of the frogs and toads. Upon theselast I shall not dwell : all know that they benlife in the water like fishes ; that they are at.Reptiles. 4274irBt without legs, or any instrument of motionbut a tail, which by its undulations from side toside steers the apparently disproportioned bodyto which it is appended, and makes its way withrapidity through its native element Few areignorant that they first acquire a single pair oflegs; and lastly, that, another pair being alsoacquired, they leave the water by myriads, andappear, without a tail, as four-footed, and, atcertain times, noisy reptiles.■«Order 3. — ^^The general function of ^^The Phidiasseems connected with almost the wholeanimal kingdom. The insects, frogs, and otherreptiles, several birds and beasts, up as highas the rumitumt and even the camerarius tribes,become the prey of various species. They actthe same part with land animals, that their analogues,the eels and other apud and cyclostomousfishes do with respect to those of the water.Scmie are analogues of the lion and the tiger,as the Oriental Python and the Occidental Boawhich sometimes exceed thirty feet in length,and are as thick as a man's body ; while otherscompete with the minor predaceous beasts inthe destruction they occasion amongst the lesserquadrupeds. But while the predaceous quadrupeds,with the exception of the Hyena, leaveuntouched the skeleton of the animals theydevour, the Ophidians swallow the entire FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.mal, flesh and bone and skin, and thus completelyremove it from the face of natoie;whereas the others, where they abound and areunmolested, make their domain like a charthouse, and deform the earth with the ghastlyrelics of their cruelty and voracity.The mechanism of the mouth of these animalsis so contrived by Divine Wisdom, and thepieces that form it so put together, as to enablethem to twist and distort and dilate it so enormouslythat they can swallow animals biggerthan their own bodies The vertebrae of thegreat Boa are more numerous than those ofother serpents, which gives them a greaterpower of surrounding and strangling their preywith their dreadful voluminous folds, of crushingit, and, with the help of their saliva, renderingit fit for deglutition. With their tail, likewise,they can lay strong hold of a tree, so as touse it as a fulcrum, by which their powers otcompression are increased and rendered mweavailable where they have to contend with thestruggles of powerful animals.Order 4. — The connection of the Sauria$iSf orthe animals forming the next Order with theOphidians, is very intimate. Cuvier says thatmany serpents under the skin have the vestige ofa posterior limb, which in some shows its extras1 Cuv. Anat, Camp. Hi. 90.REPTILES. 429city externally, in the form of a little clawsAfliongst the lizards is one that has only twofore legB^ and another that has only two hindones;' and a third in which the legs are soshort and so distant, and the body so slenderand serpentine, that they resemble a snakewith four legs rather than a lizard.This Order is divided into numerous generaand sub-genera. One of the most celebrated isthe Chameleon. I have already noticed someof its peculiarities, aUd its mode of catching theinsects that form its foods The ancients wereof opinion that it lived upon air, led by thepower it has of swelling itself to twice its naturalsize, by inflating its vast lungs, when its bodybecomes transparent. Cuvier is of opinion thatit is the size of the lungs of these animals thatenables them to change their colour, not in orderto assume that of the bodies on which theyhappen to be, but to express their wants andpassions. He supposes that the blood, beingconstrained to approach the skin, more or less,assumes different shades, according to the degreeof transparency The Rev. L. Guilding, however,mentions another genus,^ the species ofwhich, when in search of prey, adapt theircolour to the green tree or dark brown rock on1 R^gn. An, ii. 71. ^ Chirotes, ^ Bipes,♦ Seps.

The object of this maybeto conceal themselves from their enemies, aswell as from their prey.The Guanas^^ also, are said to change theircolour; they are remarkable, as well as theAnoliSf for the kind of goitre in their throat,which when irritated or excited they can inflateto a large size. These animals, though theirflesh is said to be unwholesome, in the countriesthey frequent are highly prized for the table, andare often hunted with dogs. Their eggs also arein request.The Monitors or safeguards as the Frenchcall some of them, deserve notice, because onespecies ' is said to assist in the diminution of thecrocodile, since, like the ichneumon, it devoursits eggs, and even the young ones, on whichaccount it is supposed to be sculptured on themonuments of the ancient Egyptians* Thisname was green them because they w^^ believedto warn people, by hissing, of the approachof the crocodile, or venomous reptiles.> Zool. Joum. iv. 165. * Iguana vulgar$,3 M, niloticus.Reptiles. 431But the most celebrated of the Saurians, fromthe earliest ages, is the Crocodile: its history,however, is so well known that I shall only mentiona few circumstances, of less notoriety, connectedwith it. There has been some differenceof opinion as to whether the crocodile can movethe upper or lower jaw. Aristotle observes, allanimals move the lower jaw, except the crocodileof the river, for this animal only moves theupper Demon says the same.^ Lacepede, on thecontrary, affirms that the lower jaw is the onlymoveable ones I was assured by Mr. Cross,when looking at two alligators in his menagerie,then at Charing-cross, that they moved boththeir jaws ; and my friend Mr. Martin has observedthe same thing in India. M. GeoffreySt. Hilaire and Baron Cuvier nearly reconcilethe two opinions. The heod^ says the former,moves on the lower jaw like the lid of a snuffbox,that opens by a hinge.

Theteeth of the predaceous tribes are fitted to retainor lacerate their prey, but not to masticateit; so that the function of the great majorityappears to be the same with that of the Ophirbefore mentioned, the complete deglutitionof the animals their instinct compos themto devour. Insects, which, of all minor animalare the most numerous, and require most to bekept in check, form the principal part of thefood oi a large proportion of them.

Birds. ■>We are now arrived at the highest departmentof the animal kingdom, the members of whichare not only distinguished by a vertebral column,but also by warm red blood, and a moreample brain. This department consists of twogreat Classes, viz. those that are oviparous anddo not suckle their young; and those that areviviparous which suckle their young till theyare able to provide for themselves. The first ofthese Classes consists of the Birds and the lastof the Quadrupeds Whales j and Seals, called fromthe above circumstance Mammalians. Man,though physically belonging to the latter Class,metaphysically considered, is placed far above thewhole animal kingdom, by being made in theimage and after the likeness of his Creator, receivingfrom him immediately a reasonable and436 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.immortal soul ; and entrusted by him with ^khminion over the fish of the sea and over the findofi the airy and over every living thing that movethupon the earth.Having, in a former chapter, given someaccount of those animals, to which the waters ofthis globe are assigned as their habitation andscene of action, I am now to consider thosewhich their Creator has endowed with a powerdenied to man, and most of the Mammalians —that of moving to and fro in the air as the fishesdo in the water, which, on that account, thoughthey move also on the earth, are denominated,m the passage just quoted, the fowl of the air.The animals of this great Class are renderedparticularly interesting to man, not only becausemany of them form a portion of his domesticwealth, look to him as their master, and varymost agreeably his food ; but because numbers,also, strike his senses by the eminent beauty andgrace of their forms, the brilliancy or variety ofthe colours of their plumage, and the infinitediversity, according to their kinds, of their motionsand modes of flight. But of all their endowments,none is more striking, and ministersmore to his pleasure and delight, than theirvaried song. When the time 6f the singing birdsis come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in ourland, who can be dead to the goodness which hasprovided forrr/Zsuchanunbought orchestra, tuningBIRDS. 437th 90ul not only to joy but to mutual goodwill ;retiring all the best and kindliest feelings of ournature, and calming, at least for a time, thosethat harmonize less with the scene before us.^ I may here offer a few observations upon thevoice of animals, especially birds. A distinctionis made by physiologists between a voice and asounds and none but those that breathe by meansof lungs are reckoned to utter a voice; others,whatever their respiratory organs, only emit asound. The voice also is from the mouth alone,the sound from other parts of the body.^ Thevocal animals, therefore, are confined to thethree last classes of vertebrates— the Reptiles^the JSirdsy and the Mammalians. In most ofthese, also, the voice partakes, in some degree, ofthe character of speech ; it is intended to indicateto another the wishes, emotions, or sufferings ofthe utterer. The great organ of the voice is thewind-pipCy or tracheal artery, as it is often called,and its parts, which by its bronchial ramificationsis so intimately connected with the lungsas to form part of their substance.Birds, of all animals, are best organizedwith regard to their voice. Besides the upperlarynx, or throat, which they haye in commonwith Mammalians, at the base of their windpipe,where it divides into two branches, rendersSee Introdd, to Ent. Lett. xxiv.438 FUNCTIONS* AND INSTINCTS,ing to each lobe of the lungs, it has also anotherlarynx, forming a second local apparatus. Thisis produced by a contraction of the organ furnishedwith muscular fibres, or vocal strings,which by their various tensions and relaxations,modify greatly the tones of the voice ; ascendingalso in the tube of the wind-pipe to undei^another modification at the upper larynx, which,as it were, adds the tube of the horn to that ofthe reed. Thus, if the head of a duck is cut off,it can produce sounds by means of its lowerthroat, if I may so call it, which no quadrupedcould do. Besides this, birds can, more or less,shorten or lengthen the tube of their wind-pipe,so as to modify the sounds they emit.Though the upper larynx, in birds, has novibratory vocal strings, as in the Mammalians, tomodify the sounds, these modifications takingplace at the lower larynx, still they can enlargeor contract it, which may affect the air in itsexit, and so produce some diversity.Besides all this, whoever casts an eye overDr. Latham's and Mr. Barrels figures of thewind-pipes of various birds,* especially wild-fowl,will see that they vary greatly in their relativelength and volume ; that some are partially dilated,and others contracted, with other peculiaritiesthat distinguish individual species, spelling.Trans, iv. U ix. — xv. ; xr. /. ix.— xv. ; and xvi. /.xvii. — xxi.BIRDS. 430dally in male birds. All these, no doubt, modifytb voice, and, by the will of Him who fannedthem, cause them to utter such sounds, and speaksuch a language, as are required by the circumstancesin which they are placed. The cawingof the rook, the croaking of the raven, the cooingof the dove, the warbling of the nightingale andthe other singing birds, are all the result of theirorganization according to the plan and will ofthat Supreme Intelligence, infinite Love, Wisdom,and Power, which fabricated and fashionedthem with this view as well as others, to giveutterance to sounds that, mixed or contrasted,would produce a kind of universal concert derlighting the ear by its very discords.It is said by a late writer, that the song of thesame individual species of birds, in different districts,is differently modified. This, I shouldthink, must be occasioned by a difference in thetemperature, and other circumstances connectedwith the atmosphere.Of all animals, birds are most penetratedby the element in which they move. Theirwhole organization is filled with air, as thesponge with water. Their lungs, their bones,their cellular tissue, their feathers — in a word,almost every individual part, admit it into theirinterstices Thus giving them a degree of spesN. D. Desist.

Enveloped in softand warm plumage, they can face the cd ofthe highest regions of the air ; and the denserclad aquatic birds can also sail over the bosomof the waters, or plunge into them, without beingwetted by them. All birds, especially those lastmentioned, have a gland secreting an oily fluid,with which they anoint their feathers and rqielthe moisture.There is no part of the history of these animals,in which the care of a fatherly Providenceis more signally conspicuous than their love ofBIRDS. 44 LTheir young, and their tender care of them tillthey can drift for themselves. But as I havealready adverted to this subject and shall here-^after have occasion to resume it, I shall now saysomething on the classification of the featheredrace. It is singular that two Classes should beplaced in apposition to each other, seemingly soopposite in their character and most of their qualities,as the Reptiles and the Birds — the one themost torpid and doleful and hateful of animals,symbols of evil demons ; the other the most livelyand active, and beloved of all the creatures thatGod has made, symbols of the angelic host, andcalling upon us to look upwards, and seek thosejoys that are above us. But in spite of thisapparently striking contrast, still there is a realaffinity between the Birds and the Reptiles ; andwhen we recollect that demons are fallen angels,we may apprehend why God has placed theirsymbols in the same series.Zoologist are not altogether agreed as towhich of the Reptiles come the nearest to theBirds : the beak, and some other characters ofthe Chelonians, have been thought to indicate thatthey are entitled to that distinction f and, by hisplacing the latter immediately after the Birds,this appears to be Baron Cuvier's opinion. Anyone,indeed, that looks either at the commons or» See above, p. 261—264.Mac Leay. Har. Ent<mol. 263. ^ T.

Amongst therest is a remarkable fossil genus, regarded asextinct, which Cuvier has arranged with thedragon of modem Herpetologists, under thename oi Pterodactyle.^ The carpal and m^-carpal bones, and the phalanges of the foofthtoe of the anterior leg are excessively elongated,to which it is conjectured a membrane was attached,forming a wing for flight. M.

The serrated beak of themergansers is not very unlike that of the commonpterodactyle,^ though that of the species describedby Professor Goldfish has a few verylong dispersed teeth, of different lengths, likethose of the crocodiles The animals of the lastnamed genus, in the structure of their heart,approximate most nearly to birds, and in theirgeneral organization are at the head of the Classof ReptilesFrom these statements, it seems as if theClass just mentioned sent forth several branchestowards the Birds ; but, all circumstances considered,the pterodactyle, especially if it has feathers,or rather uniform scales, appears tocome the nearest to them, and to prove that thefeathers of the Bird are a transition from thescales, of the Reptile.^ Pt. crassirostris.

Auserines.In this last Order he includes the Bustardswhich surely ought to form a separate Sub-order.On the present occasion I shall follow thesystem of Linn, as improved by Baron Cuvier,in the last edition of his Rhgne Animal adoptingfrom linger his Order of Cursory or runners,which appears to be osculant between the gallinaceaus Order and that of the waders.That the series ought to begin with the webfootedBirds, as approaching nearest to theReptiles, there is no doubt; but which shouldterminate it, seems not satisfactorily determined.1 Otis.446 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.The birds of prey appear naturally to connect withtthe beasts of prey, rather than with the Cetaceans,next before which Cuvier has placedthem ; Cams ends the series with the Gallinaceous,which Linn contrasts with the Ruminants,and Mr. W. S. Mac Leay connects with theGnawers,^ and Illiger and Lacepede sid withthe Psittaceans, which are analogues of theQuadrumanes, but these are probably mostlyanalogous forms; there seems a more strictaffinity between the web-footed birds and theMonotremeSf the OmitharhynchuSy Eckidnti^ &c.which, in some respects, appear to form an osculantOrder, between the birds and the beasts.In fact the Birds, though united into one groupwith the Beasts by common characters, may beregarded as forming a parallel series with thelatter rather than a continuous one, several of themembers of which, respectively, represent eachother, both as to many of their external features,and their functions. Branches, like those of a tree,seem indeed to issue from every natural series,whether vegetable or animal, on all sides, and torun in all directions towards those of other series,so as to form together a perplexing labyrinth tothread which, although in many places thereappears an evident clue, in others it becomesevanescent, and the investigator of nature seemslost. But when we reflect that the Author of1 Rodeniia,BIRDS. 447Nature is infinite in his essence and attributes, wemust expect there will be something that indicatestheir or^in from such a Being; thoughnot a real, there will be in them a seeminginfinity to finite minds. He who made them seestbsm all at once, and in their several places, andtraces simultaneously every series through allits numberless divarications or convolutions;whmeas man sees only a part of the ways of hisCreator. He can have no simultaneous view ofthings, and must be contented with adding, herea little and there a little, to his stores of knowledge.To investigate the works of his Creatoris a laudable exercise of his powers, and to aimas much as possible to discover the system ofthings that the God of Nature has establishedby his Wisdom, and upholds by his Power, isto aim at the discovery of Truth ; who will moreand more reveal herself to those that, using theproper means, seek her in sincerity.Orders1.

Cuvier remarks,VOL. II. G G450 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.that these are the only birds in which the neckexceeds, and sometimes considerably, the lengthof the legs. Swimming on the surface, they canthusdip deeper to seize their prey.

This structure is probably as usefulto them as to the web-footed birds, in enablingthem to secure articles of fiK>d that would otherwisebe out of their reach.The birds at the foot of this Order, and indeedof the whole Class, are the short-winged summers,particularly the auk and the penguinsthe one having its station in the northern, andthe other in the southern seas, reaching tothe antarctic circle. The narihem one, theauktseems to rank above the penguin, for its wingshave those feathers which, from their officebeing to propel birds when they fly, are denominateddrawing feathers and they can flutterand flap their wings, while the penguins havePlesiosauruB doHchodeirtis. « A lea.Aptenodytes. ♦ Remiges,BIRDS. 451none of these feathers, and cannot use their,so called, wings as such. The legs of the auk,also, are not placed quite so near the tail as inthe southern bird, in which they are close to it,though both stand nearly in a vertical position.But though of no apparent use as wings theirshort anterior appendages that go by that name,are not given them by their Creator merely forshow, for when under water they use them asens; and when it is recollected that CaptainBeechy found them between three and fourhundred miles from any lands they seem tohave occasion for additional rowing organs.One traveller, D. Pages, says that they alsosometimes use their wings as fore-legs, walkingon all fours Some of them burrow like rabbits,but how they effect this has not been ascertained.In general they are reckoned as themost stupid and foolish animals in the wholeClass: in fact most of the web-footed birdsexhibit less of the life and spirit and gaiety thatdistinguish so conspicuously those whose principaltb^tre of motion is the air : belonging asthey do to two elements, they may be regarded,in some sense, as half fowl and half fish ; andwhen we call a man, not remarkable for sense,a gwsej we admit some such degradation inaquatic birds.1 Voyage, i. 16. s n.

Of all the oceanic birds, the frigate-birdcomes nearest to the eagle. Its keen sight, itscrooked beak, its short, robust, and plumy legs,its sharp claws, the vast extent of its wings, andits rapid flight, all show that it is the oceanicrepresentative of the king of birds. If thepeaceful flying-fish seeks a refuge from thedorado and bonitos,^ its aquatic enemies, byelevating itself from the water into the air, thefrigate-bird darts upon it like a thunder-boltand devours it. If the booby ^ has caught a fish,like the bald eagle the frigate-bird often compelsit to let go its prey, and seizes it before itreaches the water. Its extent of flight is wonderful,and exceeds that of any other marinebird ; for it possesses between the tropics adomain of more than four hundred leagues, overwhich it directs its course by day and by night;for, as the plumage of the under side of its bodyis not impervious to the water, it cannot continuelong upon it, but prefers to brave the wind and1 Tachypetes Auld. * Diameter explains,Caryph€Bna hippunu. ♦ Scomber Peiamis.^ Sala BoBsana.^ Richardson, Fw.

Mr. Bennet has given a veryinteresting account of the mode of flight of thisbird, to which I must refer the reader.*I observed, in the last chapter, that one of theshort winged family of this Order, the merganser jappears to be connected with the Saurians byits serrated beak ; but the penguins which areat the foot of the same Family and of the Order,seem connected with the CheUmians, their rudimentalwings and their legs approaching thepaddles and webbed feet of the turtles andsome of the tortoises. Their plumage, whennot analyzed, resembles very much the fur ofa seal, or some quadruped.Order 2. — I have already noticed several circumstancesrelative to the birds of this Order;*I shall not, therefore, in this place, enlargemuch upon them.

The body of these birds, generallyspeaking, in shape, seems to approach that ofthe Scratches but is rather longer, and not soplump.

As far as. can be judged from the onlyknown specimen, which was brought from NewZealand in 1812, one would think this birdosculant between the Waders and the presentOrder. Its legs, indeed, seem those of a gallinaceousbird, with a tendency, as Mr. Barrelremarks, to the spurs of that tribes but its beakis related to that of the Ibis and the lateral skinof the toes is notched as in the PhalerapesnThe wings are shorter than in any other knownbird, quite concealed by the feathers, and terminatein a claw ; a circumstance which seems toindicate an approximation to some quadrupedform. These wings, though useless for flight,were doubtless given by its Creator to thisanimal to answer some purpose in its economy,either as a weapon or a prehensile organ.

Of all the gifts of Providence,there is none that more promotes our comfortand pleasure than the majority of the animalsthat compose this Order, for it includes almostall our barn-door fowls, and the great majorityof the game pursued so eagerly by the sportsman: birds not only valuable for the varietyand delicacy of the food, both flesh and eggs,with which they supply our tables, but delightingus by the beauty, the elegance, and statelinessof their forms ; the diversity of their plumage,especially the elongated or expansile tail feathersof the males; and the rich variety and splendorof their colours. The gorgeous peacock and thegraceful pheasant have scarcely a parallel inthe other Orders, except perhaps, as to splendor,in those brilliant little gems, the humming birds.I have mentioned, on a former occasion,* thenumerous varieties of the common fowl, which1 Vol. I. p. %6.BIRDS. 461have probably been produced by climate andcultivation.

Like them, it can protrudeits tongue to a very great length, which is notowing to the structure of this oi^an itself, but toa peculiar ligamentous sheath in which it usuallyis contained. Its salivary glands are abovean inch long, and shaped somewhat like a teaspoon.The saliva they secrete is so very viscidas to be capable of being drawn into threadsfiner than a hair, and several feet in length ; sothat when the tongue is besmeared with it, noinsect that touches . it can escape. like itsanalogues, it darts its tongue into an ant-hill,or lays it on an ant-track,, and draws it backinto its mouth laden with preys It is singularthat the functions, in warm climates, given incharge by Providence to quadrupeds in tern*^ Yunx torquilla.^ I owe these observations on the wryneck principally to amedical friend, George Pelham, Esq. of Woodbine, in Suffolk,a practical ornithologist, not only systematically and anatomically,but knowing birds also in their haunts, and conversantwith their habits and instincts.Rifts. 465operate ones, in this instance, devolves uponbirds. The rapid increase of ants, in tropicalcountries, probably rendered it necessary thattheir devourers should be more numerous, andact with a greater momentum.The general functions of this Order, as theyare in most of those of the present Class, arevarious. The food of some are roots, fruits,and other vegetable substances ; ^ of others thegrubs of insects ;' of others, again, principallyinsects in general under every form;' andlastly, some to fruits or insects will add theeggs and the nestlings of other birds. ^Order 6. — The birds of this Order, theTeachers, are distinguished from the last, notonly by the characters lately noticed, but likewiseby a considerable difference in their habitsand manners. Amongst them we find all thosethat delight us by their varied song ; they aretruly birds of the atr, for they seem to have thestill command of that element ; many of themmoving gaily in every direction that their willsuggests, rising and falling, flying backwardsand forwards, or performing endless evolutions,pro re nata in their flight. These Perchers alsoare the best nest-builders, not usually selecting,like the Climbers, the interior of a hollow tree1 The Psittaceans. * The Pies.» The Cuckoos. ♦ The Toucan.VOL. II.

These birds, indeed, may becalled the inventors of the several arts of theweaver, the sempstress, and the tailor, whencesoaie of them have been denominated weaver andtaihr-hirds.The nest of the little Indian weaver-hird,^though it has neither warp nor woof, beingformed by various convolutions of the slenderleaves of some grass, so intertwined and entangledas to produce a web sufficiently substantialfor the protection of the inhabitants ofthe nest, is, nevertheless, a very wonderfulstructure, but as it is well known ^ I shall notfurther enlarge upon it, but proceed to thetailor-hirdsy whose nests are still more remain*able.India produces several species that are instructedby their Creator to sew together leavesfor the protection of their eggs and nestlingsfrom the voracity of serpents and apes ; they^ Places Textor.There are several of these nests in the museum of the ZoologicalSociety.BIRDS. 467generally select those at the end of a branchor twig, and sew them with cotton, thread, andfibres.

T^a->mince in 1820, but its singular instincts, as to itsmode of nidification, were afterwards giv^d indetail by Professor P. Save.

From this and other circumstancesthe vernal nests of these birds differ so widelyfrom those made in the autumn, that it seemsnext to impossible that both should be the workof the same artisan.The latter are constructed in a thick bunchof sedge or reed, they are shaped like a pear,being dictated below and narrowed above so asto leave an aperture sufficient for the ingressand egress of the bird. The greatest horizontaldiameter of the nest is about two inches anda half, and the vertical is five inches or a littlemoreThe most wonderful thing in the constructionof these nests is the method to which the littlebird has recourse to keep the living leavesunited, of which it is composed. The soleinterweaving, more or less delicate, of homogeneousor heterogeneous substances forms theprincipal adopted by other birds to bind togetherthe parietes of their nests ; but this Sylvia is noweaver, for the leaves of the sedges or reedsare united by real stitches. In the edge of eachi Plate XV. Fio. 2.BlRt>S. 4Wleaf she makes, probably with her beak, minuteapertures, through which she contrives to pass,perhaps by means of the same organ, one ormore cords formed of spiders' web, particularlyof that of their egg-pouches. These threads arenot very long, and are sufficient only to passtwo or three times from one leaf to another;they are of unequal thickness, and have knotsscattered here and there, which in some placesdivide into two or three branches.This is the manner in which the exterior ofthe nest is formed ; the interior consists solelyof down, chiefly from plants, a little spiders'web being intermixed, which helps to keep theother substances together. In the upper partand sides of the nest, the two walls, that is theexternal and internal, are in immediate contact ;but in the lower part a greater space intervenes,filled with the slender foliage of grasses, theflorets of Syngenesious plants, and other materialswhich render soft and warm the bed inwhich the eggs are to repose.This little bird feeds upon insects. Its flightis not rectilinear, but consists of many curves,with their concavity upwards. These curvesequal in number the strokes of the wing, and atevery stroke its whistle is heard, the intervalsof which correspond with the rapidity of itsflight.Perhaps of all the instincts of Birds, those470 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.connected with their nidification are most remarkable; and of all these, none are so wonderfulas those of the tribe to which the little birdwhose proceedings in constructing its nest Ihave just described, belongs. In the Indiantailor-birds, the object of their sutorial art isstated above ; and doubtless, in the case of theItalian, the attack of some enemy is preventedby her mode of fabricating her nest. Situated*so near the ground, her eggs, but for thisdefence, might otherwise become the prey,perhaps, of some small quadruped or reptile.He who created the birds of the air taught everyoneits own lesson, and how to place and constructits nest as to be most secure from inimicalintrusion. I may observe here, that ProfessorNitzch's three Orders, or rather Sub-classes,mentioned above, receive some confirmationfrom the places selected by the individuals composingthem, to form their nests and deposittheir eggs in. The aquatic birds generally selectplaces in the vicinity of water; the terrestrialmake them on the ground ; and the great bodyof the aerial construct their nests in' trees shrubsand plants.The birds of this Order as to their food leaveno vegetable or animal substance untouched, andthe humming-birds, with their butterfly-tongue,imbibe the nectar of flowers. Of a vast number,insects form the principal part of their food, andBIRDS. 471they are the chief check to their too great multiplication;and sometimes, as in the case of# •the locust-eating thrushes they devote themselvesto a. particular tribe of insects, but most of theinsectivorous birds vriU also eat grain.Order 7. — The last Order of Birds, theHaveners^ includes those that are most perfectin their form, and all are remarkable for theirpredatory habits. Their power of wing, andtalon, and beak, distinguish them from all otherbirds of theotr; and though some of the terrestrialbirds vie with them in magnitude, andsome of the aquatic ones, as we have seen,*exceed them in extent of wing and untiredflight, yet none can come near them in theunion of all those qualities which constitute theirclaim to the first, rank amongst the birds ; andthe eagle has, as it were, been consecrated kingover them all, by being placed in the Holy ofHolies of the Jewish temple as one of thesymbols of those powers that rule under God innature.'This* Order is usually divided into two sections,which might be denominated Sub-orders,the nocturnal birds of prey and the diurnal.The first of the birds of these sections are distinguishedby their large eyes, the enormous pupilTurdus gryllivorui. ^ See Introdd.

Mammalians..We are now arrived at the last and highest Classof the Animal Kingdom, to which man himselfbelongs, and of which he forms the summit : butthough he may be said to belong to it in somerespects, in others he stands aloof from it, as aninsulated animal, and one. exalted far above it,being created rather to govern its members, thanto be the associate of the highest of them.This Class includes many animals which areof the greatest utility to man, and without whichhe could scarcely exist, at least not in comfort ;and others again that attack him and his property; and though the fear of him, in some degree,still remains upon them, also often excitethat passion in his breast. But he of all animalsis the only one, that by the exercise of his reasoningpowers and faculties, can arm himselfwith fictitious weapons enabling him to copewith the superior strength, the fierceness, claws,and teeth of the tiger or the lion, and to lay themdead at his feet when in the very act of springingupon him.476 FUNCTIONS aHd instincts.The animals of this Class, that are terrestrialare all qtuxdrupedsy^ and are mostly covered withfur or hair, longer or shorter, though in some,these hairs become quills, as in the porcupine, orspines, as in the hedgehog ; others, like the serpentsand lizards, are protected by scales, as theManis ; and some are incased in a hard coat ofarmour, often consisting of pieces so united as toform a kind of mosaic, as the armadillo, the CMa-mypharus^^ and probably the ilf^^a^Amiciii.In the aquatic Mammalians the legs are, moreor less, converted into^^i^, or means of notation.'The whole body constituting the Class, thoughsometimes varying in the manner, are all distinguishedby giving such to their young, aa whichaccount they were denominated by the Swedishnaturalist, MammalianThe situation and number of the, usually protuberant,organs that yield the milk, vary in differenttribes and genera.

This situation is evidentlybest suited for suckling their limited numberof young ones. Amongst the Marsupians,whose young, immediately upon their birth, passinto a second matrix as it were, almost the entireskin of the abdomen forms a pocket, imposingthe lactescent organs ; those of the opossum arearranged, in Cuvier's table, in the inguinal column; but in the Kangaroos which has four, theyappear rather to be abdominal . These y ariati onsin the position and number of the organs furnishingthe sole food of the animals of the presentClass in their state of infancy, were evidentlyplanned and formed by the hand of a Being supremein Wisdom, Power, and Goodness, whoadapted every organ to the circumstances inwhich it was his will to place the diversified animalsthat compose it, and to their general structure.To those which produce not more thantwo at a birth, only two organs for suction weeusually given, placed, according to the wants ofthe animal, either between the anterior or posteriorextremities, in which latter case the posturewas never erect ^ but where he decreed an animalshould produce a more numerous progeny,he planted them in greater numbers, and so distributedthem that all belonging to the samelitter could suck at the same time.

Mr. Owen observes to me, in a letter,'' Dissections of most of the genera of Marsurplans have tended to confirm in my mind thepropriety of establishing them as a distinct andparallel group, beginning with the Mmatrhnes^which I believe to lead from Reptiles^ not birds.A general simplicity in the structure of the brain;a less perfect condition of the vocal organs ; somepeculiar dispositions of the great veins and arteries,as the presence of two superior ven^B cavesand the absence of an inferior mesenteric artery yare among the circumstances in which they, the■ R^gn, An, i. 174.MAMMALIANS. 481Mansions and Monolxemes differ from the trueviviparous Mammalians, and agree with the oviparousVertebrates. Recent opportunities of examiningthe impregnated uterus of the KoHgu*TOO and Omitharhynchus have almost determinedthat they are both OTOviviparous/'Under these impressions, confirmed and illustratedby the observations of so able a comparativeanatomist, I shall consider the Class of Mammalianssas divisible into two Subclasses^ viz. Ovo-'viviparous Mammalianss, and Viviparous Mammaliansss.It may be here observed, with regard to thestate of forwardness in which the different tribesof Mammalians leave the matrix, a considerablevariation takes place, some requiring a longer timethan others, before they can be considered as atall independent of maternal care and protection.The young ei the Ruminants, Pachyderms, andSolipeds, come into the world with the organs ofdie senses, and of locomotion, in a state to beused immediately ; they can see with their eyesand bear with their ears and walkyniikL their legsas soon as they are born; whereas the Prefacesand several others, when first born arehUnd^ and unable to waik^ and do not attainto the full use of their eyes and legs till aconsiderable time after birth. In man, thoughthe infant is born seeing yet a much longer pegII.

She haslittle to do besides suckling, and watching itin order to protect it if danger fiifeatens. Butinthe second case, she must prepare .a kind ofnest, not exposed to the lights and removed fromobservation, in which she can attend to heryoung unmolested tiU they can see and moveabout upon their legs. Every one knows how attentivefeline animals sure to these circumstances,and the Moments often excavate burrMra inwhich they bring forth and. suckle their young.The Marsnpian Mammalians probably are exposedto external circumstances, which rewkrit necessary that they should have a kind ofnidus formed of the skin of their own body, toreceive their young wb^i they leave the matrix,at which period they seem to be in a more helplessstate than any of the animals last idlnded to.^From this statement we see that the granivorousand omnivorous animals, whose food isalways at hand, come into the world the bestprepared for action ; while the carnivorous tees,and those that must, if I may so speak, procuretheir daily bread by the sweat of their brows,» Owen in Philos, Tr. 1834. 344.MAMMALIANS* 483require %o hb in some degree educated for theirfunctions before they can duly exercise it.

Cetaceans, 5. Rodents,2. Pachyderms, 6, Prefaces,3. Rumihanfs, 7. Ckeirqpterans,4. Edentates, 8. Quadrumanes.Several of these Orders may be further dividedinto Sub-orders as will appear when I come totreat of them. I have not adhered to BaronCuvier's arrangement, in placing the Ruminantsnext to the Cetaceans for. it always appeared tomeincongruous to place at the foot of the scale,animals on every account entitled to rank higher:and I am happy to find my opinion backed byMr. Owen's judgment, which be informs me isgrounded on anatomical considerations. TheHippopotamus appears to us both the pn4>ersuccessor of the Cetaceans.Order 1 . — Cetaceans. This Order may be dividedinto two Suh^ordersy the Jirst consistingof those that form the great body of the Order,which are predaceous in their habits; and thesecond of those that are herbivorous. (To thefirst belong the Whales; the Cachalots; theMAMMALIANS. 48^Nanvhab ; the Porpoises ; and the Dolphins&c. : and to the second, the Manatee; theDugong ; and Retina.)This Order is principally distinguished fromthe terrestrial Mammalians by having the kindlegs converted into a horizontal (so called) finmoving up and down. They have little or haneck, and their anterior extremities are coveredwith a tendinous membrane, which enables theanimal to use them as fins.The Precarious Cetaceans are distinguishedfrom the Herbivorous by having their mammaryorgans inguinal and by their Jins not beingprehensory.In the Herbivorous Sub-order, the mammaryorgans are pectoral, and they can use their anteriorextremities, in some degree, as hands, tocarry their young, and in locomotion.* Theyare also armed with tusks, a circumstance whichappears to connect them with the Morse orWalrus which is said, by Cuvier, to be bothherbivorous and carnivorous, and to differ considerablyfrom the rest of the Amphibians.Orders. — Pachyderms. The external characterswhich distinguish the Solipeds from thetypical Pachyderms are so striking, that theyseem almost entitled to be placed in a separateOrder. I shall, however, consider them as forminga Sub-order. (To this Order belong the• Sec above, p. 13(). ' Trichecus romanus.486 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.Hippopotamus ; the Tapir ; the Swineixihe ; theRhinoceros ; the Elephant ; the House ; and theAss; &c.) The principal character of thisOrder, are Feet armed \i^itfa hoofs incapableof prehension. In the typical Pachyderms thehoof is divided more or less, but in the SoUpedsit is not.Order 3*-^RumifUints. The Came tribe seemsto form another Sub-order in the present Subclass,distinguished by the remarkable circumstance,mentioned upon a former occasion, thatits hoof, though superficially divided, has anentire doles and the males have no horns.(This Order includes the Camel; Dromedary;Lama ; Giraffe ; the Ox and Sheep tribes ; theGoats ; the Antelopes ; the Deers ; and the Elk.)The principal character of the Order is thatwhich its name indicates, that the animalsbelonging to it, chew the cud that is,' masticatea second time the food that they swallow which,owing to the structure of their stomachs, they canreturn to the mouth after the first deglutition.Order 4. — Edentates. (This Order contains thePangolin; the Ant-eaters ; the Armadillo ; andthe Sloths ; &c.) Their distinctive cbaract^ isto have no fore teetheOrder 6-^Rodents. (guinea-pigs; Hare ndRabbit; Porcupine; Beaver; Mouse; Rat;. DoreSee above, p. 203.MAMMALIANS. 487mouse; Jerboa; Marmot; Squirrels; &c.) Theprincipal character of this order are its front orcutting teeth; of these there are two in eachjaw, separated from the grinders by an interval,so that they can neither seize any living preyor lacerate its flesh; they cannot even cut thealiments which form their subsistence, but theycan, as it were, file them, and by constant labour,nibbling and gnawing, reduce them to fragmentsproper for deglutition. They are connectedwith the hanguroOy the wombat, andother MarsupianSi and the beaver exhibits oneof the distinctive characters of the Monitress,it has only one passage by which the excrementsare ejected.Order G* — Predaceans or Zoopfiagans. Cuvier'ssubdivisions of this Order may be regarded, forthe most part, as Sub-orders, but there is onetribe included in it by this great man, the Chei^ropteransy which seems rather to form an EsculentOrder, between it and the Quadrumanes.(Walrus; Seals; Cat; Leopard; Panther; Tiger';Lion; Hyaena; Ichneumon, Civet-cat; Fox; Wolf;Dog; Otter; Martin; Weasel; Glutton; Bear;Mole; Hedgehog; Shrew; &c.) The animals ofthis Order have three kinds of teeth, viz. cutting-teeth,cayenne teeth, and grinders; their ;»a«^ arearmed with claws; their muzzle is often setwith whiskers, usually called sellers ; theirmammary organs are dispersed ; their intestines488 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.are less voluminous than those of h6rbiv<m>u8animals, a provision the object of which is toprevent the flesh which forms their food fromputrefying, by remaining too long in the body.Order 7. — Cheiroptera?^ (Bats; Vamp3fre8;sndFlying-cats). The animals of this Order aredistinguished by real organs for flight, formedof the skin extended between the l^s» asdescribed on a former occasion ;^ their mattmary organs, as in the Quadrumanes, are pectoral; they are, in some points, connected withthe flying opossum, flying squirrels, &c.0$*der 8. — Quadrumanes. (Monks; Apes;Baboons ; Oran-outans.) The great characterthat distinguishes this order is, a moveable thumbon their lower extremities opposed to thefingersyso that they can use the carbury metacafjms, andphalanges of both extremities as hands. I havemore than once had occasion to observe thatcertain tribes in the animal kingdom seem occasionallyto form centres from which rays divergetowards different parts. The quadrantsafibrd another example of this disposition innature : the lory, for instance, looks towardsthe sloths ; the baboon, the Cynoeephalus of theancients, towards the dogs and bears ; the ayeaye amongst the Rodents, also might be takenSee above, p. 156.Sec Vol. I. p.

Order; 1. — ^^The animals of thisOrder have puzzled Zoologists to ascertain theirplace and character. At first they were regardedas oviparous instead of mammiferous quadrupeds,and the Ornytharhynchus in particular, wasthought to be something between bird and beast.The researches of Mr. Owen have almost provedthat the animal just named does not leave thwomb of its mother as an egg, requiring herincubation, to complete its birth; but in theform it is afterwards to maintain, in which caseit must necessarily drive its support from herbysome lactescent organ, traces of which havebeen discovered* Its beak resembling , thatof a duck, and its webbed feet seem to cournext it, in some degree, with the first Order ofthe Birds; but the entire scapular apparatusthe development of the oviduct and uterusin both sides, the absence of the ligamentumteres, its four legs, and reptant motions, shewthat it is most nearly connected with the Reptiles.The £<!hidna, by its extensile tongue, itsfood, and mode of taking it, approaches the ant-eaters: it also rolls itself up like an armadillo.The functions of the Order seem to be to keepin check the numbers of small animals; theSee Vol. II. p. 210.490 FUNCTIONS AND Instinct.Echidna the ants; and the Ormthoryncfaua,which frequents the waters, some that aweaquatic. But we know very little of their habitsand history.Orilef' 2. — The animals of this Order are partlyherbivorous, and partly carnivorous. The combatsthe koala,' the kanguroo,' and other NewHolland species, are herbivorous ; thephalaagist^of the Moluccas, lives upon, the trees, and devoursinsects as well as fruits. The New Hollandopossums are very voracious, and devour carcassesas well as insects: they enter into thehouses, where their voracity is very troublesome.That most common in Americans like the fox,attacks poultry in the night, and sucks theireggs. It is said to produce often sixteen youngones in one litter, which, when Erst bora, do notweigh more than a grain each! though blindand s^most shapeless, when placed in the pouchthey instinctively find the nipple, and adhere toittill they attain the size of a mouse, which doesnot take place till they are fifty days old, at whichperiod they begin to see ; after this they do not^ wholly leave the pouch sill they are as big as arat ! I This statement is so extraordinary, that,though apparently believed by Cuvier, on theauthority of Barton's it seems almost incredible.1 Phascolomys, « Laurus. ^ Macrqpus.♦ Phalanges orientalis, * Dasyurus,^ Didelphis virginian. ' Rkgn, An. I. 176.Mammalian. 491It IS strange, as the animal seems common inAmerica, that Say, or some other Zoologist ofthat country, has not turned his attention to it.I have mentioned, on another occasion severalparticulars of the history of the kanguroo andkoala, \i^hich I need not repeat here. Indeedour knowledge of the history and instincts ofthe Marsupian animals is very limited. Europeproduces none. New Holland, some of theAsiatic islands, and North and South America,are their principal habitations. As the youngof these animals leave the matrix of their motherat so early a period, and when, if they wereexposed to the atmosphere, they must inevitablyperish, it is evident that some such protection,as that with which Providence has furnishedthem, was necessary for the preservation of therace. Doubtless some wise and beneficial endis answered by the seeming premature nativityof these little creatures.The opossums are peculiar to America, andare remarkable for having a greater number ofteeth than any other animal, amounting in all tofifty ; they approach the Quadrumanes, by havingthe thumb of their hind foot opposed to thefingers, whence they have been called Pedi-manes,but it is not armed with a nail. They areusually stationed on the trees, where they pursue#^ See above, p. 175, 211.49a FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.birds and insects, tho!]^h, like the monkeys, theyoften eat fruity and by this structure of the hindfoot they can probably better support themselveson the branches. Many of the animals of thisOrder tend also to the Rodents, and others to thePredaceana.Sub-class 2. Order 1 . — At the foot of the presentClass are found the most gigantic animalswith which it has pleased God to people theglobe that we inhabit.The destruction, however, at least in the Arcticseas, of these animals, is so great, that it hasbeen supposed, they are not suffered to live longenough to attain their full dimensions ; but thishas been doubted. Mr. Scoresbyby sftw none inthose seas that exceeded sixty-eight feet inlength ; but some are said to reach one hundredand twenty feet. I saw one, which was exhibitedtwo years ago, in the King's Mews, thelength of the skeleton of which wad-more thanninety feet. In the Antarctic seas, where thecupidity of mercantile enterprise does not occasionany great destruction of them, some aresaid even to reach the enormous length of onehundred and sixty feet God has placed theseLeviathans where their enormous bulk can havefull play, and their enormous appetite be fullysatiated, in the vast and teeming depths of theSee above, p. 432.MAMMALIANS. 49l8oceans where, wisher they move horizontally,or, by the aid of that powerful organ, their forkedtail, seek the deep waters, there is space, and tospare, even for them.The oamiyorous, or cretaceous Cetaceans mayTery conveniently be divided into sections bycharacters which distinguish their maxillaryorgans ; the common whales and the fin-whaleshave their jaws armed with no real teeth, butonly furnished with transverse plates, formed ofwhat is called whalebone, consisting of a fibroushomy substance, sufficient for the masticationof their, for the most part, gelatinous food, whichswans in such infinite myriads in the Arcticand icy seas, that Scoresbyby calculates it wouldrequire eighty thousand persons, constantly employedfrom the Creation to count the numberof those existing simultaneously.Animals of this section are further subdividedinto those .that have, and those that have not adorsal fin. To the latter subdivision belongsthe animal commonly distinguished as the tvhakby way of eminences and which is the principalofc^ct of the whale fishy . The senses of seeingand hearing in these animals, in the water, areextremely acute ; and their eyes are so placedlliat they can see behind as well as before andabove them, and for a great distance ; but whenBal(Bna, ^ Balmnoptera, ' Banana Mysitcetus,494 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.the head emerges born the water, this activity ofsight and hearing teases.Their motions in the water are extremely rapid.They will sometimes assume a perpendicularposition, with their head downwards, and relatingaloft their tremendous tail, lash the waler withterrific violence, like the Indian god churningthe sea into foam, and filling the air with vapour.Sometimes by the motion of this orgaj^^ theyproduce a thundering noise. They will dive tothe bottom of the ocean; and when Confinedin the shallows, these unwieldy monsters wiHsometimes leap out of the water. Their braincompared with that of man, is very smalLThe weight of the brain of an adult man isoften four pounds; that of a whale, nineteenfeet long, only three pounds and a half; yetthis is large compared with that of some otheranimals.The second section of Cetaceans ciHKdsts ofthose which have teeth only in their Upper jaw.To this tribe belongs the sea-uniav^ or narywhales distinguished by its long tusk, or tusksfor there are sometimes two, extended in a horizontaldirection.To the third section belong those that haveteeth only in their lower jaw : of this descriptionare the spermaceti whales, or cachalots,^ Monoceros, * Physeier,Mammalian 495able for their enormous head, sometimes occurslying half the length of the body. Their tertiiare long and number oa&» and all point outwards ;opposite to them, in the upper jaw, is an equalnumber of cavities, in which the ends of theteeth are lodged, when the mouth is closed.These animals are said to grow sometimes to anenormous length; and to be very criiel anddangerous*The fourth and last section of carnivorousCetaceans consists of those that have teeth inboth upper and lower jaws. To this the porpoisesthe grampus,' and the long celebrateddolphin belong. These animals are more activethan the preceding Cetaceans and have a brainof greater volume. The common dolphin is gregarious,and remarkable for its frolicsome gambols,often foretelling a storm, during which ih&ywill leap entirely out oS the water. They pursueand devour the gregarious migratory fishes, andwill even eat offal and garbage.

Only three genera have been hithertodiscovered to which this function is assigned,*and all of them consisting of animals now inexistence.The Manatees,^ belonging to this Supporter,on account of their carrying their young withtheir flappers or fiendlike legs and their breasts,probably gave rise to the fable of the siren ^or mermaid.One of the most remarkable of the herbivorousCetaceans, is the Dugong^^ which is the only animalyet known that grazes at the bottom of the seausually in shallow inlets, which it is enabled to1 See Vol. 1. p. 199—202. « Senatus Americans.^ Halicare Dxigong.MAMMALIANS. 497•ccompUrii by its power of suspending itselfsteadily in the water, and by having its jawsbent down at an angle, in such a manner as tobring the mouth into nearly a vertical direction,so that it can feed upon the sea-weeds much iathe same manner as a cow does upon the herbage,Ruppel, a traveller in Africa, discovered asecond species of Dugong in the Red Sea ; andhe is of opinion, that it was the skin of thisanimal with which the Jews were commanded tocover the tabernaclesOrder 2. Whoever compares the genuine Pachydermswith the Cetaceans, will find manypoints in which they resemble each other. Asthe latter Order contains the largest urine animals,so does the former the giants that inhabitthe earth. With respect to their integument,the skin of both is nearly naked, except in thecase of the swine, the daman,' the mammoth,and some others ; a very small eye characterizesall, and a short tail; the blubber of the whaleseems to have its analogue in the fat that coversthe muscles of the swine. One of the mostremarkable animals of this Sub-order, is thefossil one, which, on account of its enormoustusks, is named Deinotherium^ It is found in1 H. Tabemaculum. See Exod. xxn, 14.

K K498 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS-thenorth of Europe, and specimen of itepowerful jaws and tusks may be seen in dieBritish Museum. From its lower jaw twopowerful tusks rise as in the Hippopotamus, towhich Mr. Owen regards it as approaching verynear, and as forming the link that unites theCetaceans to the Pachyderms The herbivorousCetaceans, in common with the generality ofthe Pachyderms, are likewise armed with tusks;so that the interval that separates the Hippopotamusand Deinotherium from the Dugongis not very wide.The grand function of the, for the most part,mighty animals which constitute the tribe I amspeaking of, seems to be that of inhabiting andfinding their subsistence, in the tropical forestsof the old world ; both Africa and Asia haveeach their own rhinoceros, and elephant, which,by their giant bulk, and irresistible strength, canmake their way through the thickest forests orjungles. Even the swine, from the thickness ofits skin, suffers nothing from pushing throughbushes and underwood in search of acorns ; andmost of these animals, by means of their tadcs,muzzle, or horns, can dig up the roots that formtheir food. The hippopotamus seeks his provenderin the African rivers, and by means ofthe tusks with which the under-jaw is armed, —in this differing from the dugong, in which thetusks are in the upper jaw, — sis enabled to rootMammalian 49^up plate growing under the water* The tapiracto the wme part nearly in the New Worldthat the hippopotamus does in the old.By the efforts of the Pachyderms, in generalin pursuit of their own means of subsistence, away is often made for man more readily to traverseand turn to his purpose forests and woodydistricts, that would otherwise mock his efforts topenetrate into them. When we consider thevast bulk and armour of the rhinoceros, forinstance, and the violence with which he endearyours to remove obstacles out of his path, we mayin some dree calculate the momentum bywhich he is enabled to win his resistless waythrough the thickest and most entangled underwood.I need not enlarge on the second Sub-order ofthe Pachyderms, the Solipeds, the well-knownequine and asinine tribes; every one. must bestruck by the contrast .that their structure andcharacters exhibit to those of theirs Sub-order,0£ typical ones* A fiery and intelligent eye ; aneck clothed with thunder to use the words ofinspiration ; a graceful form ; speed that oftenoutstrips the wind ; are the distinctive characterswhich the highest tribe of them exhibits; whilethe other, though less beautiful, still has theorgan of sight and hearing singularly conspicuousa long tail; and ita integument clothedwith a shaggy Coarse fur : besides these clara*600 JUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.tears, the undivided hoof of both these tribeforms also a most striking distinction. No «ai*male, indeed, externally present chariK^eFB morediverse from each other than the soliped andtypical Pachyderms. God has given us theseanimals, evidently, that we may employ them asour servants, and their great function is, to carryourselves and our burthens; they also ministerin no small degree to our innocent pleasure andamusements, as well as to our defence andsecurity*Order 3. — Of all the different Orders of thepresent Class, or indeed of all the Classes of animals,none are of so much importance to theirLord as the Ruminants, which we are next toconsider; without them, hunger, cold, andnakedness would beset him, or, at least, a laisseportion of his comforts, with respect to articlesof food and clothing, must be cut off.Cuvier divides this great Order into those thathave horns, and those that have none and wemay here adopt his division, considering thesetwo sections as forming two Sub-orders. Thefirst of them, being the beasts of burden of morsthan one nation may be regarded as succeedingthe solids ; these are the camels ai dromedaries,the lamas ; and perhaps what is calledthe musk-deer, also wanting horns, may beplaced amongst them. So that we have thusbefore us animals that may be regarded asMAMMALIANS. 501looking towards the Solipeds, in the camel genus-towardsthe sheep by its fleece, in the lama; andtowards the antelope tribes in the musk.All the other Ruminants, the males at least,are armed with two horns, either simple orbranching ; either hollow, or solid ; either per*sister or deciduous. 1 feel disposed to considerthe giraffe, or camelopard, as an intermediateform between the animals that are horned, andthose without horns, for its short, persistent;scud horns, clothed with a velvet skin, seemalmost rudimentary. It may be regarded asconnecting, in some degree, the long neckedanimals, the camel and rama, &c. with the deertribe.These last, the most elegant and airy, both informand limb and motions, of the whole class,placed in contrast with the clumsiness and bulkof the Pachyderms, seem intended as one ofthe principal ornaments of the globe we inhabit,and originally to be amongst the peculiarfavourites of its king and master man. Now,instead of the innocuous animals, he takes intohis alliance, as his most intimate associates,those that are best fitted to pursue and destroy,as the dog, and the cheetah ; and thus with thehelp of the horse, he overtakes these beautifulcreatures, and, instead of caresses, they receivedeath at his hands.The head of these animals,, in some, as the602 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS,rein-deer* in both sexes, but generally only inthe males, is ornamented, as it were, with abranching forests formed by its antlers, or horns,which are solid, covered, as in the camelopard,with a velvet skin, but only during the periodof growth, and annually deciduous; these areused by the males in their mutual combats.Amongst these light and airy animals, however,some of a larger and more robust stature arethus fitted for the use of man, as the rein-deer*The elk, or moose,' the wapiti* and red deers,emulate the horse in size, and are of greatstrength, though not yet employed by manesLastly, come the Ruminants, whose horns arehollow and naked, but persistent. To thesebelong the Antelopes, one species of which hasfour horns the goats, the sheep, and the bovinetribes. The species of the two last of these greatfamilies are particularly important to man, andare generally so well known as not to requireto be treated of in detail.

The hareis only noticed for its extreme timidity andwatchfulness, and the rabbit for the burrowswhich it excavates for its own habitation, andas a nest for its young : but there is an animalrelated to them, the rat-Jiare,^ which is gifted byby its Creator with a very singular instinct, onaccount of which it ought rather to be called thehay-makei\ since man may or might have learnedthat part of the business of the agriculturist,which consists in providing a store of winterprovender for his cattle, from this industriousanimal. Professor Pallas was the first whodescribed the quadruped exercising this remarkablefunction and gave an account of it. TheHungarians, who inhabit the country beyond thelake of Baikal, call it Pika, which has beenadopted as its Trivial name.These animals make their abode between therocks, and during the summer employ themselvesin making hay for a winter store.

InSeptember, they form heaps or stacks of thefodder they have collected under the rocks or inother places shattered from the rain or snow.Where many of them have laboured togethertheir stacks are sometimes as high as a man,and more than eight feet in diameter. A subterraneangallery leads from the burrow, belowthe mass of hay, so that neither frost nor snowcan intercept their communication with it.

They set about building some time inthe month of August.

They construe thesedikes or dams of the same materials as they dstheir lodges, namely, of pieces of wood of anykind, of stones, mud, and sand. These ranksways oppose a sufficient hairier to the force, bothof water and ice; and as the willows, poplars, &c.employed in constructing them, often strike rootMAMMALIANS. 511in it, it becomes in time a green hedge, inwhich the birds build their nests* Cartwrightsays that he occasionally used them as bridges,but as they are level with the water, not withoutwetting his feet. By means of these erectionsthe water is kept at a sufficient height, forit is absolutely necessary that there should be atleast three feet of water above the extremityof the entry into their lodges, without which,in the hard frosts, it would be entirely closed.This entry is not on the land side, because suchan opening might let in the wolverene, and otherfierce beasts, but towards the water.Cuvier, in his table above alluded to,* assignsonly four pectoral teats to the female beaver ;but Dr. Richardson states that she has eighty andthe maximum of her young ones at eight ornine.* The number inhabiting one lodge seldomexceeds four old and six or eight young ones ; thesize of their houses, therefore, is regulated by thenumber of the family. Though built of thesame materials, they are of much ruder structurethan their causeways, and the only object oftheir erection appears to be a dry apartment toImpose in, abc where they can eat the food theyoccasionally get out of the water. It frequentlyhappens, says Heame, that some of the largebouses have one or more partitions, but these are1 866 above, p; 476. - * Fn. Boreal.

He had seen one beaver lodge that hadpearly a dozen apartments under the same roof,and, two or three excepted, none had any communicationbut by water. Cartwright says, thatwhen they build, their first step is to make choiceof a natural basin, of a certain depth, near thebank where there is no rock ; they thai beginto excavate under water, at the base of the bank,which they enlarge upwards gradually, and soM to form a declivity, till they reach the surface;and of the earth which comes out of this cavitythey form a hillock, with which they mix smallpieces of wood, and even stones : they give thishillock the form of a dome, from four to seemfeet high, from ten to twelve long, and from eightto nine wide. As they proceed in heightening,they hollow it out below, so as to form the lodgewhich is to receive the family. At the anteriorpart of this dwelling, they form a gentle declivityterminating at the water ; so that they literand go out under water. The hunters name thisentrance the angle. The interior forms only asingle chamber resembling an oven. At a littledistance is the magazine for provisions.

These form their subsistence.T%^ir magazines sometimes contain a cart-load ofthese articles, and the beavers are so industrious,that they are always adding to their store.There is a species of beaver found in the greatrivers in Europe — the Danube, the Rhine, theRhone, and the Weser, which has been regardedas synonymous with the beaver of Canada, butwhich, though it forms burrows or holes in thebanks of those rivers which it frequents, does not,like them, erect any lodges, as above described.Does this instinct sleep in them, and require acertain degree of cold to awaken it, or are they adistinct species? Linn mentions one in Laplandwhere the cold is sufficiently intense. Cuvierseems uncertain whether they ought to be consideredas distinct. Beavers seem formerly to haveexisted in England ; the town of Beverley {Bea-ver'field)^ in Yorkshire, seems to have taken itsname from them, and its arms are three beaversSuch are the principal operations that thesewonderful animals, probably by the mixture ofintellect with instinct, are instructed and adaptedby their Creator to execute, that man, by studyingthem and their ways, may acknowledge thePower, Wisdom, and Goodness that formed andguides them.The functions of the numerous tribes of thisOrder are various. The great majority may beVOL. 11. L L514 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.said to be granivorous, or nucivorous, or evengranivorous ; but many live upon dried vegetablesubstances, and wood. The aye eye,which approaches the Quadrumanes, appears tobe insectivorous. Though many of them aregreat plagues to man, yet, by exciting his vigilance,they are useful to him, and they fond thefood of many of the lesser predaceous animals.Order 6. The connection between the animalof which this Order consists, and the Rodents,seems not easily made out. The lowest tribesthe Amphibians, which Cuvier has placed immediatelybefore the Marsupians, appears bo haveno connection with that Order, or any of theRodents; and the morse, which forms his lastgenus of the tribe in question, appears evidentlyto look more towards the herbivorous cetaceans,the manatee &c. than to any other animals ;the seals, indeed, may be regarded as tendingtowards the feline tribe. Amongst the otherPredaceans, the hedgehog and tenrec present,I apprehend, something more than an analogyto the porcupines and some of the rets. Thebear seems to look towards the sloth; and thefeline race, in their whiskers and feet, look tothe hares and rats.The general functions of this Order are tocheck the tendency to increase not only in therChetratnys,MAMMALIANS. 515own Class, the Mammalians, but in most of theother Classes of animals, more particularly thosewhich man has taken into alliance with him, ascattle, and poultry, and game of every description.But where his action is greatest, theirs isusually least ; and the most powerful devastationsof the animal kingdom the lions and the tigers,are found in the warmest climates, where natureis most prolific, and where man has not fullyestablished his dominion, in the trackless andburning deserts of Libya, and in the impenetrableforests and jungles of India.In more northern regions, the bears, the foxes,and other Mammalians, are employed in thisdepartment, though the former also eat roots andother vegetable substances and thus in the wildcountries of the north supply the place of man,and keep the animal population under, and ata certain level, so that one may not encroachupon another. If the matter is closely investigated,we shall find that God has distributedand divided these predaceous animals to everycountry, in measure and momentum, as everyonehad need.The necrophagous Mammalians' also, orthose that devour dead carcases, such as thehyaenas, dogs, and similar animals, are equallyus^l in removing infectious substances, whichF7i.

The animals of this Order, thoughevidently leading towards the Quadrumanes,seems less nearly connected with the insectivorousPredaceans of Cuvier, the hedgehog, mole,&c., and to approach nearer to some Marsupians,as the flying squirrel and the flying opossum.I therefore consider them as forming an EsculentOrder, distinguished by their powers and organsof flight before sufficiently noticed.'

When Isay that Man stands at the head of the creation,I do not mean to affirm that he combines inhimself every physical attribute in perfectionthat is found in all the animals below him ; forit is manifest to every one, that many of themfar exceed him in the perfection of many oftheir organs, and in their qualities of variouskinds. For sights he cannot compete with theeagle; for scent , with the hounds or the shark;for swiftness with the roe-imck ; for strength andbulk, with the elephant: but it is in his mindthat his superiority lies. There is in him aSPIRIT, an immaterial substance which constituteshim the sole representative here on earth,of the spirit OF SPIRITS. He is the only memberof the Animal Kingdom that partakes both ofa heavenly and of an earthly nature, — thatbelongs both to a material and an immaterialworld: and on this account it was that God,when he had created man, constituted him kingover the whole sphere of animals with which hehad peopled this globe that we inhabit. Whenhis unhappy /a/^ took place, the Divine Imagewas impaired, and consequently the dominionover those creatures, which formed a part of it,was proportionably weakened, and reduced to520 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.ltd present standard. But still, though weakened,it is not abrogated ; his subjects have notuniversally broken the yoke and burst the bondsof his dominion — a large portion of them stillacknowledge him as their king and master ; andthose that he has not subdued so as to makethem do his bidding, still fear him and flee him :and even of these, there is none so fierce andintractable, that he has not found means to tameand subdue. And this is the position in whichhe now stands with respect to the animal kingdom; he has that within him that enables himto master them, and apply such of them as areof a convertible nature, if I may so speak, towork his will and answer his purpose.The functions of man, with r^ard to theworld in which he is now placed, are all includedin his action upon the sphere of animalsand vegetables, and in then* reaction upon hill.If we survey all nature, wherever we turn oureyes, or wherever we direct our thoughts, wesee the action of antagonist powers, a flux andreflux, by which the Great Builder of theuniverse supports the vast machine, and maintainsall the motions that he has generated in it.The same principle is at work in every descriptionof beings in our own planet ; every actionof man upon any object of the world, withouthim, produces a reaction from that object, at*fended often by important results.MAN. 5*11The action of man upon the world withouthim, is threefold. His Jirst action upon themis;that of the mind to contemplate them, so asto sin a knowledge of their forms and structurestheir habits and instincts — of theirmeaning and uses. His second action uponthem, having studied their natures, and discoveredhow they • may be made profitable tohim, is to .collect and multiply such species ashefinds will, in any way, answer his purpose.His third action upon them is to diminish andkeep within due limits those species that experienceteaches him are noxious and prejudicialeither to himself, or those animals that he hastaken into alliance with him, which are principalsources of wealth to him, and minister tohis daily use, comfort, and enjoyment.If we consider the predaceous animals, weshall find in them a greater tendency to multiplythan in those that content themselves with grazingthe herbage ; they generally produce moreyoiitig at a birth ; and their period of gestation isoften shorter, so as to admit of more than onelitter in the year ; so that, unless some means wereused to reduce their numbers within a certainlimit, the whole race of herbivorous animalsmust perish. Hence arose the first kind of war.Man armed himself to destroy such of his subjectsas had rejected his dominion, and evencontended with him for the possession of the earth.522 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.and to have license to devour at will its nitrepeaceful inhabitants. A similar cause generatedthe other and more fearful kind of war, of manwith man. Whence came wars and fightingsamongst you, saith the Apostle ;' come they nothence even of your lusts that war in your members ?The highest view that we can take of man isthat which looks upon him as belonging to aspiritual as well as a material world. The endof the creation of the earth, says the father andfounder of Natural History, is the glory of God,from the works of nature, by man only.' And,as the same pious author observes, *' How contemptibleis man," if he does not aim at this endof his creation, if he does not strive to raisehimself above the low pursuits that usuallyoccupy his mind !' The heavens indeed declarethe glory of God, and the firmament sheweththe work of his hands. Day unto day utteredspeech, and night unto n^ht sheweth knowledge"*The beasts of the field honour him, andall creatures that he hath made glorify him.But man must study the book open before him ;and the more he studies it, the more audible tohim will be the general voice to his spiritual ear,James, it. 1.Finis creations tellers est gloria Dei expire nature perhominem solum.

Thus wehave minerals that, under certain circumstances,as it were, vegetate, and shoot into various forms,representing trees and plants : there are plantsthat represent insects, and, vice versa, insectsthat simulate plants ; and the Zoophytes havereceived their name from this resemblancesAnd as we ascend the scale, every where a seriesof references of one thing to another may betraced, so as to render it very probable that everycreated thing has its representative somewherein nature. Nor is this resemblance confined toforms ; it extends also to character. If we beginat the bottom of the scale, and ascend up toman,we shall find two descriptions in almostevery class, and even tribe of animals : one,Vol. I. p. 149, 156, 169.324 FUNCTIONS XSD INSTINCTS.ferocious in their aspect, ofl^n rapid in theirmotions, predaceous in their habits, preying upontheir fellows, and living by rapine and bloodshed ;while the other is quiet and harmless, makingno attacks, shedding no blood, and subsistingmostly on a vegetable diet.Since God created nothing in vain, we mayrest assured that this system of representationwas established with a particular view. - Themost common mode of instruction is placing certainsigns or symbols before the eye of thelearner, which represent sounds or ideas ; and sothe great Instructor of man placed this worldbefore him as an open though mystical book, inwhich the different objects were the letters and>f words of a language, from the study of which besmight gain wisdom of various kinds, and beinstructed in such truths relating t6 thai spiritualworld, to which his soul belonged, as God sawfit thus to reveal to him. In the ;first place, byobserving that one object in nature representedanother, he would be taught that all things aresignificant, as well as intended to act a certainpart in the general drama ; and further, as heproceeded to trace the analogies of character, inits two great branches just alluded to upwards,he would be led to the knowledge of the doctrinethus symbolically revealed — that in the invisibleworld there are two classes of spirits— one benevolentand beneficent, and the other malevolentMAN. 525^nd< mischievous ; characters which, after hisfall, ha would find even exemplified in individualsof his own species.Bat after the unhappy fall of man, this modeof instruction by natural and other objects usedsymbolically, though it pervades the whole lawof Moses, and the writings of the prophets, aswell as several parts of the New Testament,gradually gave place to the clearer light of aRevelation, not by symbols, but by the words andlanguage of man, which he that f^mis may ofi:enread; yet still it is a vei'y useful and interestingstudy, and belongs to man as the principal inhabitantof a world stored with symbols, to ascertainwhat God intended to signify by the objectsthat he has created and placed before him, aswell as to know their natures and uses. Whenwe recollect what the Apostle tells us, that theinvisible things of God from the creation of theworld are clearly seen being understood by thethings that are made,' and that spiritual truthsare reflected as by a mirror, and shewn, as itwere, enigmatically,^ we shall be convinced that,in this view, the study of nature, if properly conducted,may be made of the first importance.In this enumeration and history of the prin1 Rom, i. 20. « 1 Cor. xiii. 12.526 FUNCTIONS AND INSTINCTS.cipal tribes of the Animi Kingdom, we havetraced in every page the footsteps of infiniteWisdom, Power, and Goodness. In our ascentfrom the most minute and least animated partsof that Kingdom to man himself, we have seenin every department that nothing was left tochance, or the rule of circumstances, but everythingwas adapted by its structure and organizationfor the situation in which it was to beplaced, and the functions it was to discharge;that though every being, or group of beings, hadseparate interests, and wants, all were made tosubserve to a common purpose, and to promote acommon object; and that though there was ageneral and unceasing conflict between the membersof this sphere of beings, introducing apparentlydeath and destruction into every part ofit, yet that by this great mass of seeming evilpervading the whole circuit of the animal creation,the renewed health and vigour of the entiresystem was maintained. A part suffers for thebenefit and salvation of the whole ; so that thedoctrine of the sufferings of one creature, by thewill of God, being necessary to promote the wd-fare of another, is irrefragably established byevery thing we see in nature ; and further, thatthe is an unseen hand directing all to accomplishthis great object, and taking care that thedestruction shall in no case exceed the necessity.MAN. 527Well, then, may all finally exclaim, in the wordsof the Divine Psalmist : —O iMrdy haw manifold are thy works inWISDOM hast thou made them all; the earthis full of thy riches ;So is the great and wide sea also wherein arethings creeping innumerable both small and greatbeasts.These wait all upon thee : that thou may est givethem meat in due season.When thou gives them they gather it: andwhen thou openest thy hand they are filled withgood.When thou hides thy face they are troubled :when thou takes away their breath they dice andare turned again to their dust.When thou hottest thy breath go forth they shallbe made : and thou shalt renew the face of theearth.INDEX.Abyss, L 24, 374Acalepha, i. 195, 402Accipenser, i. 107Acephala, i. 237Achatina, i. 291Acorn barnacle, ii. 3Acrita, i. 149Atrocious, ii. 179Adheres, ii. 25, 31, 118, 124Actinia, i. 244Adamson, i. 147AddisoTiy ii. 241Lilian, ii. 85Aeroscepsy, ii. 112Anarchy i. 146AgcLSsizj ii. 390Austria, i. 150Aggregate animals, i, 220Air, Introdd. xciiAlbatross, ii. 453Alma, ii. 450Alcyonium, i. 157Alcyon, i. 160Alitrunk, ii. 147Alligator, i. 32 ; ii. 431Simulacra, i. 203American animals, i. 390Ametabolians, ii. 314Ammonites, i. 20, 315Ammophila, ii. 330Amorous, i. 182Amorpba, i. 147Ampbitrite, i. 345; ii. 103Amphibious, ii. 137, 143Ampbiuma, ii. 421Anemone, ii. 25Enables, ii. 380VOL.
