M. ROGET.-fori £PREFACE.I probably never should have ventured toengage in the composition and publication ofa work like the present, had not that taskbeen assigned me by my nomination as one ofthe writers of the series of Bridgewater Treatises,and had I not deeply felt the honourdone me by that appointment, as well as theimportance of the duty which it imposed.The hope, in which I have indulged, that mylabours might eventually be useful, has beenmy chief support in this arduous undertaking ;the progress of which has throughout beenseriously impeded by the various interruptionsincident to my profession, by long protractedanxieties and afflictions, and by the almostoverwhelming pressure of domestic calamity.The object of this treatise is to enforce theVlll PREFACE.great truths of Natural Theology, by adducingthose evidences of the power, wisdom, andgoodness of God, which are manifested in theliving creation. The scientific knowledge ofthe phenomena of life, as they are exhibitedunder the infinitely varied forms of organization,constitutes what is usually termed Physiology,a science of vast and almost boundlessextent, since it comprehends within itsrange all the animal and vegetable beings onthe globe. This ample field of inquiry has, oflate years, been cultivated with extraordinarydiligence and success by the naturalists ofevery country ; and from their collective laboursthere has now been amassed an immensestore of facts, and a rich harvest of valuablediscoveries. But in the execution of my taskthis exuberance of materials was rather asource of difficulty ; for it created the necessityof more careful selection and of a more extendedplan.In conformity with the original purpose ofthe work, which I have all along endeavouredto keep steadfastly in view, I have excludedPREFACE. IXfrom it all those particulars of the naturalhistory both of animals and of plants, and alldescription of those structures, of which therelation to final causes cannot be distinctlytraced ; and have admitted only such facts asafford manifest evidences of design. Thesefacts I have studied to arrange in that methodizedorder, and to unite in those comprehensivegeneralizations, which not only conduceto their more ready acquisition and retentionin the memory, but tend also to enlargeour views of their mutual connexions, and oftheir subordination to the general plan of creation.My endeavours have been directed togive to the subject that unity of design, andthat scientific form, which are generallywanting in books professedly treating ofNatural Theology, published prior to thepresent series ; not excepting even the unrivalledand immortal work of Paley. Byfurnishing those general principles, on whichall accurate and extensive knowledge mustsubstantially be founded, I am not without ahope that this compendium may prove aX PREFACE.useful introduction to the study of NaturalHistory ; the pursuit of which will be foundnot only to supply inexhaustible sources ofintellectual gratification, but also to furnish, tocontemplative minds, a rich fountain of religiousinstruction. To render these benefitsgenerally accessible, I have confined myself tosuch subjects as are adapted to every class ofreaders ; and, avoiding all unnecessary extensionof the field of inquiry, have whollyabstained from entering into historical accountsof the progress of discovery ; contentingmyself with an exposition of the presentstate of the science. I have also scrupulouslyrefrained from treading in the paths, whichhave been prescribed to the other authors ofthese treatises ; and have accordingly omittedall consideration of the hand, the voice, thechemical theory of digestion, the habits andinstincts of animals, and the structures ofantediluvian races ; the extent of the fieldwhich remained, and which, with these fewexceptions, embraces nearly the whole of thephysiology of the two kingdoms of nature,PREFACE. XIalready affording ample occupation for a singlelabourer.The catalogue of authors whose works havefurnished me with the principal facts detailedin these volumes, is too long for insertion inthis place. I have not encumbered the pagesof the work by continual citations of authorities; but have given references to them onlywhen they appeared to be particularly requisite,either as bearing testimony to factsnot generally known, or as pointing outsources of more copious information. It mayhowever be proper to mention, that I havemore especially availed myself of the amplematerials on Comparative Anatomy andPhysiology contained in the works of Cuvier,Blumenbach, Carus, Home, Meckel, DeBlainville, Latreille, and St. Hilaire, and in thevolumes of the Philosophical Transactions, ofthe Memoires and Annales du Museum, andof the Annales des Sciences Naturelles. Ishould be ungrateful were I not also to acknowledgethe instruction I have derived frommy attendance on the lectures at the RoyalXll PREFACE.College of Surgeons, delivered successively,during many years, by the late Sir EverardHome, Sir Ashley Cooper, Mr. Lawrence,Mr. Brodie, Mr. Green, and Sir CharlesBell ; and also from those of Professor Grant,at the University of London.I have likewise to return my thanks for theliberal manner in which the Board of Curatorsof the Hungarian Museum gave me permissionto take such drawings of the preparations itcontains, as I might want for the illustrationof this work ; and to Mr. Cleft, the conservator,and Mr. Owen, the assistant conservatorof the museum, for their obliging assistanceon this occasion. Mere verbal description cannever convey distinct ideas of the form andstructure of parts, unless aided by figures ;and these I have accordingly introduced veryextensively in the course of the work.*Being compelled, from the nature of myAll the wood engravings have been executed by Mr.Field, and the drawings for them were, for the most part, madeby Miss Carlow, whose assistance on this occasion has beenmost valuable to me.PREFACE. Xlllsubject, and in order to avoid tedious andfatiguing circumlocution, to employ manyterms of science, I have been careful to explainthe meaning of each when first introduced: but as it might frequently happen that,on a subsequent occurrence, their significationmay have been forgotten, the reader willgenerally find in the index, which I have,with this view, made very copious, a referenceto the passage where the term is explained.I beg, in this place, to express my deepsense of the obligation conferred on me byMr. Davies Gilbert, the late president of theRoyal Society, to whose kindness I owe mybeing appointed to write this treatise.I also take this opportunity of conveyingmy best thanks to my friend and colleague,Mr. Children, of the British Museum, for hiskind assistance in revising the sheets whilethe work was printing, and for his many valuablesuggestions during its progress throughthe press.A catalogue of the wood engravings hasbeen subjoined ; and also a tabular view of theXIV PREFACE.classification of animals adopted by Cuvierin his " Regni Animal' with familiar examplesof animals included under each division; both of which I conceived might proveuseful for purposes of reference. The lattertable is reprinted from that which I havegiven in my " Introductory Lecture on Humanand Comparative Physiology," published in1826, with only such alterations as were requiredto make it correspond with the secondand improved edition of Cuvier's work.NOTICE.The series of Treatises, of which the present is one, ispublished under the following circumstances :The Right Honourable and Reverend FrancisHenry, Earl of Bridgewater, died in the month ofFebruary, 1829 ; and by his last Will and Testament, bearingdate the 25th of February, 1825, he directed certainTrustees therein named to invest in the public funds thesum of Eight thousand pounds sterling; this sum, withthe accruing dividends thereon, to be held at the disposalof the President, for the time being, of the Royal Societyof London, to be paid to the person or persons nominatedby him. The Testator further directed, that the person orpersons selected by the said President should be appointedto write, print, and publish one thousand copies of a workOn the Power, Wisdom, and Goodness of God, as manifestedin the Creation ; illustrating such work by all reasonablearguments, as for instance the variety and formation ofGod's creatures in the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms; the effect of digestion, and thereby of conversion ;the construction of the hand of man, and an infinite varietyof other arguments ; as also by discoveries ancient andmodern, in arts, sciences, and the whole extent of literature.He desired, moreover, that the profits arising from the saleof the works so published should be paid to the authors ofthe works.XVIThe late President of the Royal Society, Davies Gilbert,Esq. requested the assistance of his Grace the Archbishopof Canterbury and of the Bishop of London, in determiningupon the best mode of carrying into effect the intentions ofthe Testator. Acting with their advice, and with the concurrenceof a nobleman immediately connected with thedeceased, Mr. Davies Gilbert appointed the following eightgentlemen to write separate Treatises on the differentbranches of the subject as here stated :THE REV. THOMAS CHALMERS, Dad.PROFESSOR OF DIVINITY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH.ON THE POWER, WISDOM, AND GOODNESS OF GODAS MANIFESTED IN THE ADAPTATIONOF EXTERNAL NATURE TO THE MORAL ANDINTELLECTUAL CONSTITUTION OF MAN.JOHN KIDD, M.D. Fer.

The Being who bestowed on him thisfaculty cannot but have intended that he shouldso exercise it, and that he should acquire,through its means, some insight, however limited,into the order and arrangements ofcreation ; some knowledge, however imperfect,of the divine attributes ; and a distinct, thoughfaint, perception of the transcendent glory withwhich those attributes are encompassed. ToMan have been revealed the power, the wisdom,and the goodness of God, through the mediumVOL. I. BFINAL CAUSES.of the Book of Nature, in the varied pages ofwhich they are inscribed in indelible characters.On Man has been conferred the high privilegeof interpreting these characters, and of derivingfrom their contemplation those ideas of grandeurand sublimity, and those emotions of admirationand of gratitude, which elevate and refine thesoul, and transport it into regions of a purer andmore exalted being.A study which embraces so extensive a rangeof objects, and which involves questions of suchmomentous interest to mankind, must necessarilybe arduous, and requires for its successful prosecutionthe strenuous exertions of the humanintellect, and the combined labours of differentclasses of philosophers, during many ages. Themagnitude of the task is increased by the verysuccess of those previous efforts : for the difficultiesaugment as the objects multiply, and theeminence on which the accumulated knowledgeof centuries has placed us only discloses a widerhorizon, and the prospect of more fertile regionsof inquiry ; till at length the mind, conscious ofthe inadequacy of its own powers to the comprehensionof even a small part of the system of theuniverse, is appalled by the overwhelming considerationof the infinity that surrounds us. Thereflection continually presents itself that theportion of creation we are here permitted tobehold is as nothing when compared with theFINAL CAUSES.immensity of space, which, on every side, spreadsfar beyond the sphere of our vision, and indeedfar beyond the powers of human imagination.Of the planetary system, which includes thisearth, our knowledge is almost entirely limitedto the mathematical laws that regulate the motionsof the bodies which compose it, and to thecelestial mechanism which patient investigationhas at length discovered to be that most admirablycalculated to preserve their harmony andmaintain their stability. Still less have we themeans of penetrating into the remoter regions ofthe heavens, where the result of our investigationsrespecting the myriads of luminous bodiesthey contain amounts to little more than theknowledge of their existence, of their countlessnumbers, and of the immeasurable distances atwhich they are dispersed throughout the boundlessrealms of space.Measured on the vast scale of the universe,the globe we inhabit appears but as an atom ;and yet, within the compass of this atom, whatan inexhaustible variety of objects is contained :what an endless diversity of phenomena is presented; what wonderful changes are occurringin rapid and perpetual succession ! Throughoutthe whole series of terrestrial beings, what studiedarrangements, what preconceived adaptations,what multiplied evidences of intention,what signal proofs of beneficent design exist to4 FINAL CAUSES.attract our notice, to excite our curiosity, and toanimate our inquiries. Splendid as are the monumentsof divine power and wisdom displayedthroughout the firmament, in objects fitted bytheir stupendous magnitude to impress the imaginationand overpower us by their awful grandeur,not less impressive, nor less replete withwonder, are the manifestations of those attributesin the minuter portions of nature, which aremore on a level with our senses, and more withinthe reach of our comprehension. The modernimprovements of optical science, which haveexpanded our prospects into the more distantregions of the universe, have likewise broughtwithin our range of vision the more diminutiveobjects of creation, and have revealed to usmany of the secrets of their structure and arrangement.But, farther, our reason tells usthat, from the infinite divisibility of space, therestill exist worlds far removed from the cognizanceof every human sense, however assistedby the utmost refinements of art ; worlds occupiedby the elementary corpuscles of matter,composing, by their various configurations, systemsupon systems, and comprising endlessdiversities of motions, of complicated changes,and of widely extended series of causes andeffects, destined for ever to remain invisible tohuman eyes, and inscrutable to human science.Thus, in whatever field we pursue our in-finalCAUSES. 5queries, we are sure to arrive at boundarieswithin which our powers are circumscribed. Infinitymeets us in every direction, whether in theascending or descending scale of magnitude ;and we feel the impotence of our utmostefforts to fathom the depths of creation, or toform any adequate conception of that supremeand Dominant Intelligence, which comprehendsthe whole chain of being extending from thatwhich is infinitely small to that which is infinitelygreat.It is incumbent on us, before engaging in astudy of such vast importance, and extendingover so wide a field as that which lies before us,to examine with attention the nature of thoseprocesses of reasoning, by which we are conductedto the knowledge of the peculiar class oftruths we are seeking. Such a preliminaryinquiry is the more necessary, inasmuch as theinvestigation of these truths is beset with manyformidable difficulties and liable to varioussources of fallacy, which are not met with in thestudy of other departments of philosophy.The proper objects of all human knowledgeare the relations that exist among the phenomenaof which the mind has cognizance. The phenomenaof the universe may be viewed as connectedwith one another either by the relation ofcause and effect, or by that of means and end ; andaccordingly these two classes of relations giveFINAL CAUSES.rise to different kinds of knowledge, each ofwhich requires to be investigated in a peculiarmode and by a different process of reasoning.The foundation of both these kinds of knowledgeis, indeed, the same ; namely, the constantuniformity which takes place in the successionof events, and which, when traced in particularclasses of phenomena, constitutes what we metaphoricallycall the Laws of Nature. It is theprovince of philosophy, strictly so called, todiscover the circumstances or laws which regulatethis uniformity, and to arrange the observedchanges according to their invariable antecedents,or causes : the unknown links by whichthese causes are connected with their respectiveconsequents, or effects, being denominated thepowers of Nature. With reference to phenomenawhich are purely mechanical, that is, to changeswhich consist in the sensible motions of materialbodies, these powers are denominated forces ;and the intensities, the operations, and the charactersof these forces admit of exact definition,according to the qualities of the corresponding-effectsthey produce. It is by pursuing themethod of philosophical induction, so well explainedby Bacon, that the physical sciences,which the misdirected efforts of former ages hadfailed to advance, have, within the last twocenturies, been carried to a height of perfectionFINAL CAUSES. 7which affords just grounds for exultation in theachievements of the human intellect.In the investigation of the powers which areconcerned in the phenomena of living beingswe meet with difficulties incomparably greaterthan those that attend the discovery of thephysical forces by which the parts of inanimatematter are actuated. The elements of the inorganicworld are few and simple ; the combinationsthey present are in most cases easily unravelled; and the powers which actuate theirmotions, or effect their union and their changes,are reducible to a small number of general laws,of which the results may, for the most part, be anticipated,and exactly determined by calculation.What law, for instance, can be more simple thanthat of gravitation, to which all material bodies,whatever be their size, figure, or other properties,and whatever be their relative positions, areequally subjected ; and of which the observationsof modern astronomers have rendered itprobable that the influence extends to theremotest regions of space ? The most undeviatingregularity is exhibited in the motions ofthose stupendous planetary masses, which continuallyroll onwards in the orbits prescribedby this all-pervading force. Even the slighterperturbations occasioned by their mutual influenceare but direct results of the same general8 FINAL CAUSES.law, and are necessarily restrained within certainlimits, which they never can exceed, and bywhich the permanence of the system is effectuallysecured. All the terrestrial changes dependenton these motions partake of the sameconstancy. The same periodic order governsthe succession of day and night, the rise andfall of the tides, and the return of the seasons :which order, as far as we can perceive, is incapableof being disturbed by any existing cause.Equally definite are the operations of theforces of cohesion, of elasticity, or of whateverother mechanical powers of attraction or repulsionthere may be, which actuate, at insensible distances,the particles of matter. We see liquids,in obedience to these forces, collecting in spheroidalmasses, or assuming, at their contact withsolids, certain curvilinear forms, which are susceptibleof precise mathematical determination.In different circumstances, again, we beholdthese particles suddenly changing their places,marshalling themselves in symmetric order, andconstructing by their union solid crystals of determinatefigure, having all their angles andfacets shaped with mathematical exactness.The forces by which dissimilar particles areunited into a chemical compound have beentermed Chemical Affinities ; and the operation ofthese peculiar forces is as definite and determinableas the former. They are now known to beFINAL CAUSES. 9regulated by the law of definite proportions ;a law, the discovery of which has conferred onChemistry the same character of precision whichappertains to the exact sciences, and which ithad never before attained. The phenomenaof Light, of Heat, of Electricity, and of Magnetismhave been, in like manner, reduced to lawsof sufficient simplicity to admit of the applicationof mathematical reasoning, and to furnishthe accurate results derived from such application.Thus to whatever department of physicalscience our researches have extended, we everywheremeet with the same regularity in the phenomena,the same simplicity in the laws, andthe same uniformity in the results. All isstrictly defined, and subjected to rigid rule : allissubordinate to one pervading principle oforder. The great Creator of the universe hasexercised in its construction the severest andmost refined geometry, has traced with unerringprecision the boundaries of all its parts, andhas prescribed to each element and each powerits respective sphere and limit.Far different is the aspect of living Nature.The spectacle here offered to our view is everywherecharacterised by boundless variety, byinscrutable complexity, by perpetual mutation.Our attention is solicited to a vast multiplicity ofobjects, curious and intricate in their mechanism,10 FINAL CAUSES.exhibiting peculiar movements, actuated bynew and unknown powers, and gifted with highand refined endowments. In place of the simplecombinations of elements, and the simple propertiesof mineral bodies, all organic structures,even the most minute, present exceedingly complicatedarrangements, and a prolonged successionof phenomena, so varied and so anomalous,as to be utterly irreducible to the known lawswhich govern inanimate matter. Let us hasten,with fresh ardour, to explore this new worldthat here opens to our view.Turning, then, from the examination of thepassive objects of the material world, we now directour attention to the busy theatre of animatedexistence, where scenes of wonder and enchantmentare displayed in endless variety around us ;where life in its ever-changing forms meets theeye in every region to which our researches canextend ; and where every element and everyclime is peopled by multitudinous races of sensitivebeings, who have received from the bounteoushand of their Creator the gift of existenceand the means of enjoyment. Our curiosity ispowerfully excited by phenomena in which ourown welfare is so intimately concerned, as areall those that relate to animal life ; and wecannot but take a lively and sympathetic interestin the history of beings in many respects soanalogous to ourselves like us possessing powersFINAL CAUSES. 11of spontaneous action, impelled by passions anddesires, and endowed with capacities of enjoymentand of suffering. Can there be a moregratifying spectacle than to see an animal in thefull vigour of health, and the free exercise of itspowers, disporting in its native element, revellingin the bliss of existence, and testifying by itsincessant gambols the exuberance of its joy ?We cannot take even a cursory survey of thehost of living beings profusely spread over everyportion of the globe without a feeling of profoundastonishment at the inconceivable varietyof forms and constructions to which animationhas been imparted by creative power. Whatcan be more calculated to excite our wonderthan the diversity exhibited among insects, allof which, amidst endless modifications of shape,still preserve their conformity to one generalplan of construction? The number of distinctspecies of insects already known and describedcannot be estimated at less than 100,000 ; andevery day is adding to the catalogue.* Of thecomparatively large animals which live on land,how splendid is the field of observation that liesopen to the naturalist ! What variety is conspicuousin the tribes of Quadrupeds and of Reptiles ;Four-fifths of the insects at present known have been discoveredwithin the last ninety years: for in 1743, Ray estimatedthe total number of species at 20,000 only. See his work onThe wisdom of God as manifested in the Creation," p. 24.12 FINAL CAUSES.and what endless diversity exists in their habits,pursuits, and characters ! How extensive is thestudy of Birds alone ; and how ingeniously, ifwe may so express it, has nature interwoven intheir construction every possible variation compatiblewith an adherence to the same generalmodel of design, and the same ultimate referenceto the capacity for motion through the lightelement of air. What profusion of being isdisplayed in the wide expanse of the ocean,through which are scattered such various andsuch unknown multitudes of animals ! Of Fishesalone the varieties, as to conformation and endowments,are endless. Still more curious andanomalous, both in their external form, andtheir internal economy, are the numerous ordersof living beings that occupy the lower divisionsof the animal scale ; some swimming in countlessmyriads near the surface ; some dwelling in theinaccessible depths of the ocean : some attachedto shells, or other solid structures, the productionsof their own bodies, and which, in processof time, form, by their accumulation, enormoussubmarine mountains, rising often from unfathomabledepths to the surface. What sublimeviews of the magnificence of creation have beendisclosed by the microscope, in the world ofinfinite minuteness, peopled by countless multitudesof atomic beings which animate almostevery fluid in nature ? Of these, a vast varietyFINAL CAUSES. 13of species has been discovered, each animalculebeing provided with appropriate organs, endowedwith spontaneous powers of motion, and givingunequivocal signs of individual vitality. Therecent observations of Professor Ehrenberg havebrought to light the existence of Monads, whichare not larger than the 24,000th of an inch, andwhich are so thickly crowded in the fluid as toleave intervals not greater than their own diameter.Hence he has made the computationthat each cubic line, which is nearly the bulk ofa single drop, contains 500,000,000 of thesemonads, a number which equals that of all thehuman beings existing on the surface of theglobe.Thus, if we review every region of the globe,from the scorching sands of the equator to theicy realms of the poles, or from the lofty mountainsummits to the dark abysses of the deep ; ifwe penetrate into the shades of the forest, or intothe caverns and secret recesses of the earth ;nay, if we take up the minutest portion of stagnantwater, we still meet with life in some newand unexpected form, yet ever adapted to thecircumstances of its situation. Wherever lifecan be sustained, we find life produced. Itwould almost seem as if Nature* had been thusIn order to avoid the too frequent, and consequently irreverent,introduction of the Great Name of the Supreme Beinginto familiar discourse on the operations of his power, I have,14 FINAL CAUSES.lavish and sportive in her productions with theintent to demonstrate to Man the fertility of herresources, and the inexhaustible fund fromwhich she has so prodigally drawn forth themeans requisite for the maintenance of all thesediversified combinations, for their repetition inendless perpetuity, and for their subordinationto one harmonious scheme of general good.The vegetable world is no less prolific inwonders than the animal. In this, as in allother parts of creation, ample scope is foundfor the exercise of the reasoning faculties, andat the same time abundant sources are suppliedof intellectual enjoyment. To discriminate thedifferent characters of plants, amidst the infinitediversity of shape, of colour, and of structure,which they offer to our observation, is the laborious,yet fascinating, occupation of the Botanist.Here, also, we are lost in admiration at the never-endingvariety of forms successively displayed toview in the innumerable species which composethis kingdom of nature, and at the energy ofthat vegetative power, which, amidst such greatdifferences of situation, sustains the modified lifeof each individual plant, and which continues itsspecies in endless perpetuity.

It is well knownthat, in all places where vegetation has beenestablished, the germs are so intermingled withthe soil, that whenever the earth is turned up,even from considerable depths, and exposed tothe air, plants are soon observed to spring, as ifthey had been recently sown, in consequence ofthe germination of seeds which had remainedlatent and inactive during the lapse of perhapsmany centuries. Islands formed by coral reefs,which have risen above the level of the sea,become, in a short time, covered with verdure.From the materials of the most sterile rock, andeven from the yet recent cinders and lava of thevolcano, Nature prepares the way for vegetableexistence. The slightest crevice or inequality issufficient to arrest the invisible germs that arealways floating in the air, and affords the meansof sustenance to diminutive races of lichens andmosses. These soon overspread the surface, andare followed, in the course of a few years, bysuccessive tribes of plants of gradually increasing-sizeand strength ; till at length the island, orother favoured spot, is converted into a naturaland luxuriant garden, of which the productions,rising from grasses to shrubs and trees, presentall the varieties of the fertile meadow, the tangledthicket, and the widely spreading forest. Evenin the desert plains of the torrid zone, the eye of10 FINAL CAUSES.the traveller is often refreshed by the appearanceof a few hardy plants, which find sufficient materialsfor their growth in these arid regions :and in the realms of perpetual snow which surroundthe poles, the navigator is occasionallystartled at the prospect of fields of a scarlet hue,the result of a wide expanse of microscopic vegetation.*But whatever charms the naturalist may findin the occupations in which he is engaged, andhowever wide may be the field of his exertions,they still are insufficient to satisfy the moreenlarged curiosity of a philosophic mind. Thepassive emotion of astonishment, in which inferiorintellects are content to rest, serves but toawaken, in him who has learned to think, adesire of further knowledge. Filled with anardent spirit of inquiry, he cannot but be impatientunder the feeling that, while Nature hasplaced before his eyes this splendid spectacle ofanimation, she has thrown a dense veil over theinterior machinery of life, and has concealedfrom his view the springs by which she setsit in motion. With the hope of discovering herThe red snow, discovered in Baffin's Bay on the 17th ofAugust, 1818, during the Northern Expedition, under the commandof Captain Ross, was found to owe its colour to minutefungi, or microscopic mushrooms, which vegetate on the surfaceof snow, as their natural abode.

Trans, for 1820,p. 165.FINAL CAUSES. 17proceedings, he hastens to explore the severalparts which compose the organized fabric, toexamine in minute detail the anatomy of its structure,and to ascertain the nature of the severalactions that take place within it. But, overwhelmedby the multiplicity of objects, and lostamidst the complication of phenomena, he soonbecomes dismayed by the magnitude and arduousnature of the investigation. He findsthat his labours will be of no avail, unless,previously to any attempt at theory, he takes acareful and accurate account of all the circumstancesattending the history and conditions oflife, from the dawn of its existence to its appointedclose. On tracing living beings to theirorigin, he learns that every individual vegetableand animal takes its rise from an atom of imperceptibleminuteness, and gradually increases inbulk by successive accretions of new matter,derived from foreign sources, and, by some refined,but unknown process, transmuted into itsown substance. Then, following the progressivedevelopment of the organs, he observes themundergoing various modifications'* as they areassuming new forms, which characterise certaindefinite epochs in the general growth of thesystem. In a great number of instances, especiallyamong the lower orders of animals, hewitnesses the same individual being acting, inits time, a variety of different parts ; often .i. c18 FINAL CAUSES.pearing on the stage of life with new organs, newfaculties, and new conditions of existence, andundergoing metamorphoses as complete as anythat have been depicted in the fables of antiquity.The period at length arrives when the animal,having completed its growth, attains the maturityof its being, and acquires the full possessionof its powers. Every organ in succession hasreceived its entire development, and has unitedits energies with those which had been beforeperfected. Yet, however complete the arrangementsthat have thus been established, it is stillnecessary, in order to preserve the whole systemin a state in which it may be capable of exercisingthe functions of life, that the materialswhich compose its fabric should undergo a certainslow, but constant renovation ; and thesame circle of actions and reactions, which havebrought it to its state of perfection, must continueto be repeated, in order that a due proportionmay be maintained between the consumptionand the supply of these materials. In thecourse of a certain time, however, even underthe most favourable circumstances, this equilibriumbegins to fail : the energies of the systemdecline : and the processes of nutrition are insufficientto repair the waste in the substance ofthe body. The fluids are dissipated faster thanthey can be renewed ; the channels throughwhich they circulate are more and more ob-finalCAUSES. 10strutted, and at length cease to be pervious:and the solids gradually become hard and rigid.As in a machine of which the wheels are worn,and the springs have lost their elastic force, sointhe animal body, at an advanced age, theslightest additional impediment that occurs willstop the movements of the whole system : and,when once stopped, their renewal is impossible.Nature has thus assigned to every living being acertain period as the utmost extent of its duration.Even when exempt from external interference,all are doomed to perish, sooner orlater, by the slow but unerring operation of thesame internal causes which originally effectedtheir development and growth, and which areinseparably interwoven with the conditions oftheir existence.Numerous, however, are the extraneous andaccidental causes that may hasten or precipitatetheir destruction, long before the period of naturaldecay. How striking is the contrast, on thoseoccasions, between the scene we have just beheldof an animal in the full vigour of its powers,either rapidly bounding across the plain, or glidingbeneath the wave, or soaring in the elevatedregions of air, and the spectacle of the sameanimal lying, the next moment, extended at ourfeet, bereft at once of activity and of sense —of all the faculties and powers that constitutelife. Can we contemplate without amazement20 FINAL CAUSES.so complete and instantaneous a change ; sosudden and awful a catastrophe ? Must we notbe animated by an eager desire to penetrate sogreat a mystery, and resolve the many questionswhich so striking a phenomenon must naturallyitsuggest ? What, we are led to ask, is the natureof this extraordinary revolution, extending overthe whole of that frame which had so long delightedthe eye by its beauty, and producingthis sudden and irretrievable extinction of thepowers of life? How comes it that all thosemighty energies which the animal had so latelydisplayed, and which had called forth ouradmiration, perhaps even excited our envy, areat once and for ever annihilated ? What wasthe bond, thus suddenly dissevered, which heldtogether the various parts of that compoundframe? What potent spell has been dissolved,which could retain in combination for so long aperiod the multifarious elements of that exquisiteorganization ; and from the control of whichbeing now released, these elements hasten toresume their wonted attractions, and enteringinto new forms of combination, are scattered intodust, or dissipated in air, leaving no trace oftheir former union ? What mechanism has beenemployed in its construction? What refinedchemistry has been exerted in assimilating newparticles of matter to those previously organized,and in appropriating them to the nourishment ofFINAL CAUSES. 21the parts with which they became identified?By what transcendent power, above all, did thisassemblage of material particles first becomeanimated by the breath of life ; and from whatelevated source did they derive those higherenergies, apparently so foreign to their inherentproperties, and investing these once lifeless andinert materials with the exalted attributes ofactivity, of sensation, of perception, of intelligence?Shall we ever comprehend the natureof this subtle and pervading principle, by theagency of which all these wonderful phenomenaof life are produced, and which, combining intoone harmonious system so many heterogeneousand jarring elements, has led to the formationof this exquisite frame, this elaborate machine,this miraculous assemblage of faculties ?The discovery of a clue, if any such can befound, to the mazes of this perplexing labyrinthcan be hoped for only from the successful cultivationof the science of physiology. But beforeengaging in this arduous study, we oughtpreviously to inquire into the methods of reasoningby which it is to be conducted.The object of physiology is, by the diligentexamination of the phenomena of life, to ascertainthe laws which regulate those phenomena,both as they apply to the individual beings endowedwith life, and also as they relate to thevarious assemblages that constitute the species,22 FINAL CAUSES.the genera, the families, the orders, and the classesof those beings ; and, lastly, as they concern thewhole collective union of the organized world.These peculiar laws, which it is the provinceof physiology to investigate, are, as I havebefore observed, of two kinds, each foundedupon relations of a different class. The first,which depend upon the simple relation of causeand effect, are concerned merely with the naturalpowers of matter. They are the laws thatregulate the succession of phenomena purelyphysical in all their stages. These phenomenaconsist in changes among material particles,which are either of a mechanical or chemicalnature ; or in the affections of imponderablephysical agents, such as heat, light, electricity,and magnetism ; and they include also thephenomena that take place in organized bodies,and which are referable to the operation of certainphysical powers, appertaining to particularstructures, such as muscular contraction andnervous irritation ; phenomena which, as weshall afterwards find, are not reducible to anyof the former laws, but are peculiar to the livingstate. The second class of laws comprise thosewhich are founded on the relation of means to anend ; and which are usually denominated Finalcauses. They involve the operations of mind, inconjunction with those of matter. They presupposeintention or design ; a supposition whichFINAL CAUSES. 23implies intelligence, thought, motives, volition, —particular purposes to be answered, requiring theagency of powers and of instruments adapted tothe production of the intended effects: — theknowledge of the properties of matter, the selectionand choice of particular means, and thepower of employing them in an effective manner.These purposes may themselves be subservientto more general objects, and these objects againsubordinate to remoter ends ; so that the wholeshall comprehend a systematic plan of operations,conducive, on the most enlarged views, to ultimateand general utility.The study of these final causes is, in somemeasure, forced upon our attention by even themost superficial survey of nature. It is impossiblenot to recognise the character of intention,which is so indelibly impressed upon everypart of the structure both of vegetable and animalbeings, and which marks the whole series ofphenomena connected with their history. Microscopicobservations teach us that the embryoof an organic being contains within itself therudiments of the future vegetable or animalstructure, into which it is gradually transformedby the slow and successive expansion and developmentof all its parts. The processes ofnutrition do nothing more than fill up the outlinesalready sketched on the living canvass.Every organ, nay every fibre, resulting from24 FINAL CAUSES.this development, contributes its share in theproduction of certain definite effects, which weconstantly witness taking place around us, aswell as experience in our own persons. Butthese effects, though so familiar to us, are not onthat account the less involved in mystery, or theless replete with wonder. To say that they arethe results of chance conveys no information ;and is equivalent to the assertion that they arewholly without a cause. Every one who is accustomedto reflect upon the operations of hisown mind must feel that such a conclusion iscontrary to the constitution of human thought ;for if we are to reason at all, we can reason onlyupon the principle that for every effect theremust exist a corresponding cause ; or, in otherwords, that there is an established and invariableorder of sequence among the changes which takeplace in the universe.But though it be granted that all the phenomenawe behold are the effects of certain causes,it might still be alleged, as a bar to all furtherreasoning, that these causes are not only utterlyunknown to us, but that their discovery is whollybeyond the reach of our faculties. The argumentis specious only because it is true in oneparticular sense, and that a very limited one.Those who urge it, do not seem to be aware thatits general application, in that very same sense,FINAL CAUSES. 25would shake the foundation of every kind ofknowledge* even that which we regard as builtupon the most solid basis. Of causation, it isagreed that we know nothing ; all that we doknow is, that one event succeeds another withundeviating constancy. Now, if we were toprobe this subject to the bottom, we should findthat, in rigid strictness, we have no certainknowledge of the existence of any thing, savethat of the sensations and ideas which areactually passing in our minds, and of which wearenecessarily conscious. Our belief in theexistence of external objects, in their undergoingcertain changes, and in their possessing certainphysical properties, rests on a different foundation,namely, the evidence of our senses ; for itis the result of inferences which the mind is, bythe constitution of its frame, necessarily led toform. We may trace to a similar origin thepersuasion, irresistibly forced upon us, that thereexist not only other material objects beside ourown bodies, but also other intellectual beingsbeside ourselves. We can neither see nor feelthose extraneous intellects, any more than wemean see or feel the cause of gravitation, or thesubtle sources of electricity or magnetism. Wenevertheless believe in the reality both of the oneand of the other ; but it is only because we infertheir existence from particular trains of impressFINAL CAUSES.sons made upon our senses, of which impressionsalone our knowledge can, in metaphysical strictness,be termed certain.Upon what evidence do I conclude that I amnot a solitary being in the universe ; that all isnot centered in myself ; but that there exist otherintellects similar to my own ? Undoubtedly noother than the observation that certain effects areproduced, which the experience I have had of theoperations of my own mind lead me, by an irresistibleanalogy, to ascribe to a similar agency,emanating from other beings ; beings, however,of whose actual intellectual presence I cannot beconscious, whose nature I cannot fathom, whoseessence I cannot understand. I can judge ofthe operations of other minds only in as far asthose operations accord with what has passedin my own. I cannot divine processes of thoughtto which mine have borne no resemblance, Icannot appreciate motives of which I have neverfelt the influence, nor comprehend the forceof passions never yet awakened in my breast :neither can I picture to myself feelings to whichno sympathetic chord within me has ever vibrated.Our own intelligence, our own views, and ourown affections, then, furnish the only elementsby which it is possible for us to estimate theanalogous powers and attributes of other minds.The difficulty of applying this scale of measure-finalCAUSES. 27ment will, of course, increase in proportion to thedifference between the objects compared ; andalthough we may conceive that there are powersand intelligences infinitely surpassing our own,the conceptions we can form of such superioressences must necessarily be indefinite and obscure,and must partake of the same kind ofimperfection as our notions of the distances ofthe heavenly bodies, however familiar we maybewith the units of the scale by which thosedistances are capable of being expressed. When,on the other hand, the objects contemplated aremore within the range of our mental vision ;when, for instance, they are phenomena that wecan assimilate to our own voluntary acts, and inwhich we can clearly trace the connexion betweenmeans and end, then does our recognitionof the agency of intellect become most distinct,and our conviction of its real and independentexistence become most intimate and assured.Such is the kind of evidence on which rests ourbelief of the existence of our fellow men. Such,also, is the foundation of our assurance thatthere exists a mighty Intellect, who has plannedand executed the stupendous works of creation,with a skill surpassing our utmost conceptions ;by powers to which we can assign no limit, andthe object of whose will is universal good.*The viewhere taken is, of course, limited to Natural Theology ;that being the express and exclusive object of these Treatises.28 FINAL CAUSES.It will argue no undue presumption, therefore,if, in our earnest endeavours to form just ideas ofthe attributes of the Deity from the examinationof nature, we are led to institute comparisonsbetween His works and those of man ; and striveto gather some faint notions of the divine intelligenceby applying the only standard of admeasurementwhich we possess, and are permitted toemploy, namely, that derived from the operationsof human intellect. Our interpretations of thedesigns of the Creator must here be obtainedthrough the medium of human views ; and ourjudgment of His benevolence can be formedonly by reference to our own affections, and bytheir accordance with those ardent aspirationsafter good, which the Author of our being hasdeeply interwoven with our frame.The evidence of design and contrivance in theworks of nature carries with it the greatest forcewhenever we can trace a coincidence betweenthem and the products of human art. If in anyunknown region of the earth we chanced todiscover a piece of machinery, of which thepurpose was manifest, we should not fail toascribe it to the workmanship of some mechanist,possessed of intelligence, actuated bya motive, and guided by intention. Farther, ifwe had a previous experience of the operation ofsimilar kinds of mechanism, we could not doubtthat the effect we saw produced was the oneFINAL CAUSES. 29intended by the artificer. Thus, if in an unexploredcountry, we saw, moving upon the watersof a lake, the trunk of a tree, carved into theshape of a boat, we should immediately concludethat this form had been given to it for the purposeof enabling it to float. If we found it alsoprovided with paddles at its sides, we shouldinfer, from our previous knowledge of the effectsof such instruments, that they were intended togive motion to this boat, and we should nothesitate to conclude that the whole was the workof human hands, and the product of humanintelligence and design. If, in addition, wefound this boat furnished with a rudder and withsails, we should at once understand the object ofthese contrivances, and our ideas of the skill ofthe artificer would rise in proportion to the excellenceof the apparatus, and the ingenuitydisplayed in its adaptation to circumstances.Let us suppose that in another part of thislake we found an insect,* shaped like the boat,and moving through the water by successiveimpulses given to that medium by the action oflevers, extending from its sides, and shaped likepaddles, having the same kind of movement, andproducing the same effects. Could we resist thepersuasion that the Artificer of this insect, whenSuch as the Notonecta glance, Lin., or water boatman, andthe Dytiscus marginalis, or water beetle.•30 FINAL CAUSES.forming it of this shape, and providing it withthese paddles, had the same mechanical objectsin view? Shall we not be confirmed in this ideaon finding that these paddles are constructedwith joints, that admit of no other motion thanthat of striking against the water, and of thusurging forwards the animal in its passagethrough that dense and resisting medium ? Manyaquatic animals are furnished with tails whichevidently act as rudders, directing the course oftheir progressive motion through the fluid.Who can doubt but that the same intention andthe same mechanical principles which guide thepractice of the ship-builder, are here applied inamanner still more refined, and with a master'shand? If Nature has furnished the nautiluswith an expansible membrane, which the animalis able to spread before the breeze, when propitious,and by means of which it is wafted alongthe surface of the sea, but which it quicklyretracts in unfavourable circumstances, is not herdesign similar to that of the human artificer,when he equips his bark with sails, and providesthe requisite machinery for their being hoistedor furled with ease and expedition ?The maker of an hydraulic engine placesvalves in particular parts of its pipes and cisterns,with a view to prevent the retrogrademotion of the fluids which are to pass throughthem. Can the valves of the veins, or of theFINAL CAUSES. 31lymphatics, or of the heart have a differentobject : and are they not the result of deliberateand express contrivance in the great Mechanistof the living frame ?The knowledge of the laws of electricity, in itsdifferent forms, is one of the latest results whichscience has revealed to man. Could these laws,and their various combinations, have been unknownto the Power who created the torpedo,and who armed it with an energetic galvanicbattery, constructed upon the most refined scientificprinciples, for the manifest purpose ofenabling the animal to strike terror into itsenemies, and paralyse their efforts to assail it.Does not the optician, who designedly places hisconvex lens at the proper distance in a darkenedbox, for the purpose of obtaining vivid picturesof the external scene, evince his knowledge ofthe laws of light, of the properties of refractingmedia, and of the refined combinations of thosemedia by which each pencil is brought to aseparate focus, and adjusted to form an image ofremote objects? Does it not, in like manner,argue the most profound knowledge and foresightin the divine Artist, who has so admirably hungthe crystalline lens of the eye in the axis of aspherical case, in the fore part of which He hasmade a circular window for the light to enter,and spread out on the opposite side a canvass toreceive the picture ? Has no thought been exertFINAL CAUSES.cited in darkening the walls of this cameraobscura, and thus preventing all reflection of thescattered rays, that might interfere with thedistinctness of the image ?But we farther observe in the eye many exquisiterefinements of construction, by whichvarious defects, unavoidable in all optical instrumentsof human workmanship, are remedied.Of this nature are those which render the organachromatic, which correct the spherical aberration,and which provide for the adjustment ofits refracting powers to the different distances ofthe objects viewed ; not to speak of all theexternal apparatus for the protection, the preservation,and the movements of the eye-ball, andfor contributing in every way to the proper performanceof its office. Are not all these irrefragableproofs of the continuity of the same design ;and are they not calculated still farther to exaltour ideas of the Divine Intelligence, of theelaborate perfection impressed upon His works,and of the comprehensive views of His providence?These facts, if they stood alone, would be sufficientto lead us irresistibly to this conclusion :but evidence of a similar kind may be collectedin abundance from every part of living nature towhich our attention can be directed, or to whichour observations have extended. The truthsthey teach not only acquire confirmation by theFINAL CAUSES. 33corroborating tendency of each additional factof the same description, but the multitude ofthese facts is so great, that the general conclusionto which they lead must be considered asindubitable. For the argument, as it has beenjustly remarked, is cumulative ; that obtainedfrom one source being strengthened by thatderived from another ; and all tending to thesame conclusion, like rays converging to thesame point, on which they concentrate theirunited powers of illumination.The more we extend our knowledge of theoperations of creative power, as manifested in thestructure and economy of organized beings, thebetter we become qualified to appreciate the intentionswith which the several arrangements andconstructions have been devised, the art withwhich they have been accomplished, and thegrand comprehensive plan of which they form apart. By knowing the general tendencies of analogousformations, we can sometimes recognisedesigns that are but faintly indicated, and tracethe links which connect them with more generallaws. By rendering ourselves familiar with thehand-writing where the characters are clearlylegible, we gradually learn to decipher the moreobscure passages, and are enabled to follow thecontinuity of the narrative through chapters thatwould otherwise appear mutilated and defaced.Hence the utility of comprehending in our studiesVOL.

The first relatesto the individual welfare of the animal, embracingthe whole sphere of its sensitive existence,and the means of maintaining the vitalityupon which that existence is dependent. Thesecond comprises the provisions that have beenmade for repairing the chasms resulting, inthe present circumstances of the globe, from thecontinual destruction of life, by ensuring the multiplicationof the species, and the continuity ofthe race to which each animal belongs. Thethird includes all those arrangements whichhave been resorted to in order to accommodatethe system to the consequences that follow froman indefinite increase in the numbers of eachspecies. The fourth class relates to that systemFUNCTIONS OF LIFE. 35magic economy in the plans of organization bywhich all the former objects are most effectuallysecured. I shall offer some observations oneach of these general heads of enquiry.With reference to the welfare of the individualanimal, it is evident that in the brute creation,the great end to be answered is the attainmentof sensitive enjoyment. To this all the arrangementsof the system, and all the energies of itsvital powers must ultimately tend. Of whatvalue would be mere vegetative life to the beingin whom it resides, unless it were accompaniedby the faculty of sensation, and unless the sensationsthence arising were attended with pleasure? It is only by reasoning analogically fromthe feelings we have ourselves experienced thatwe ascribe similar feelings to other sentientbeings, and that we infer their existence fromthe phenomena which they present. Whereverthese indications of feeling are most distinct, wefind that they result from a particular organization,and from the affections of a peculiar partof that organization denominated the nervoussubstance. The name of brain is given to a particularmass of this substance placed in theinterior of the body, where it is carefully protectedfrom injury.The sensations, for exciting which the brain isthe material instrument, or immediate organ, arethe result of certain impressions made on parsTHE FUNCTIONS OF LIFE.titular parts of the body, and conveyed to thatorgan by the medium of filaments, composed ofa similar substance, and termed nerves. In thisway, then, it has been provided that a communicationshall be established between the sentientprinciple and the external objects, by which itsactivity is to be excited, and on which it is to bedependent for the elements of all its affections,both of sensation and of intellect. A considerableportion of this treatise will be occupiedwith the development of the series of meansby which impressions from external objects aremade on the appropriate organs that are providedto receive and collect them, so as not onlyto give rise to varied sensations, but also toconvey a knowledge of the existence and differentqualities of the objects that produce them.This latter faculty is termed Perception.But in the formation of animals it was not theintention of Providence to endow them withthe mere capacity of being affected by surroundingobjects, and of deriving from themvarious sensations of pleasure and of pain,without granting them the power of controllingthese effects, and of acting on those objects inreturn. The faculties of sensation and perception,in beings destined to be merely passive,and the sport of every contingent agency, wouldhave been not merely useless, but even banefulendowments. The same beneficent power whichTHE FUNCTIONS OF LIFE. 37has conferred these gifts has conjoined that ofvoluntary motion, by which the animal maynot only obtain possession of such objects asminister to its gratification, and reject thosewhich are useless or hurtful, but may also movefrom place to place, and enlarge the sphere ofits perceptions and of its power. The samemass of nervous substance which, under thename of brain, we have recognised as the organof sensation, is also, as will afterwards be shown,the organ of volition ; and the medium, bywhich the commands of the will are transmittedfrom the brain to the mechanical apparatus employedfor motion, is again certain filaments ofnerves ; but these nervous filaments are distinctfrom those which are subservient to sensation.Next in importance, then, to the organs ofsensation and perception, are those of VoluntaryMotion. They comprise two kinds of objects ;first, the establishment of a certain mechanism,having the cohesion, the strength, and the mobilityrequisite for the different actions which theanimal is to perform ; and, secondly, the provisionof a power, or agent, which shall be capableof supplying the mechanical force for setting thismachinery in motion. With these objects mustbe combined various subsidiary arrangementsrelating to the connexions, the support, the protection,and other mechanical conditions of theorgans of the body. It will be convenient to38 THE FUNCTIONS OF LIFE.comprehend these under one general head, consideringthem as composing the MechanicalFunctions of the animal economy. They willengage a considerable share of our attention inthis work, as affording the clearest and mostpalpable proofs of contrivance and design.From the peculiar conditions of the livingbody, not only with regard to the mechanicalproperties of its various parts, and the powersby which their movements are affected, but alsowith regard to the chemical laws which regulatethe combinations of elements composing thesubstance of the body, there is required, as willbe more fully explained in the sequel, a continualrenovation of that substance. For thispurpose new materials are perpetually wanted,and must be as regularly supplied. Hencearises a new class of functions, comprising agreat extent of operations, opening a wide fieldof curious and interesting enquiry, and furnishingabundant evidence of the wise and beneficentoperations of nature. These may be comprehendedunder a separate class bearing thegeneral title of Nutritive Functions. They areoften, also, spoken of under the designation ofthe Vital Functions, from their more immediaterelation to the continuance of vitality, that is, ofmere vegetative life, as distinguished from theexercise of the higher faculties of sensation, perception,and voluntary motion, which are theTHE FUNCTIONS OF LIFE. 39ultimate ends of animal existence, and whichare emphatically termed the Animal Functions.The vital as well as the animal functionsrequire for the execution of their various objectscertain instruments of an appropriate mechanicalconstruction, adapted to those objects. Tothe contrivances of the mechanist must be addeda refined hydraulic apparatus for the conveyanceof fluids, and for the regulation of their movements; and with these must be conjoined theskilful combinations of the laboratory, by whichthe powers of the most subtle chemistry areexercised in effecting all the transmutations requiredby this elaborate system of operations.As far as they involve mechanical principles,these objects again arrange themselves underthe mechanical functions : and I shall accordinglyinclude them under that head, when giving anaccount of this branch of the subject.There is another, and a most important consequencethat flows from the peculiar chemicalconditions of the materials of which animalstructures are composed. The mode in whichtheir elements are combined is so complex asto require a long and elaborate process to accomplishthat purpose ; and neither the organswith which animals are furnished, nor the powerswith which those organs are endowed, are adequateto the conversion of the materials furnishedby the inorganic world into the substances THE FUNCTIONS OF LIFE.quire for the construction of their bodies, andthe maintenance of their powers. These inorganicelements must have passed through intermediatestages of combination, and must havebeen previously elaborated by other organizedbeings. This important office is consigned to thevegetable kingdom. Receiving the simple foodfurnished by nature, which consists chieflyof water, air, and carbonic acid, together with asmall proportion of other substances, plants convertthese aliments into products, which not onlymaintain their own vitality, but serve the furtherpurpose of supporting the life of animals. Thuswas the creation and continuance of the vegetablekingdom a necessary step towards theexistence of the animal world ; as well as a linkin the great chain of being, formed and sustainedby Almighty power. The Physiology of Vegetablespresents many topics of great interest withrelation to final causes, and will in this Treatisebe reviewed with special reference to this importantobject.Nutrition, both in the vegetable and animalsystems, comprises a very extended series ofoperations. In the former it includes the absorptionof the crude materials from the surroundingelements, — their transmission to organswhere they are aerated, that is, subjected to thechemical action of the air ; — their circulation inthe different parts of the plant, — their furtherTHE FUNCTIONS OF LIFE. 41elaboration in particular vessels and receptacles— their deposition of solid materials — andtheir conversion into peculiar products, as wellas into the substances which compose the severalorgans ; — and, finally, the growth and developmentof the whole plant. Still more variousand complicated are the corresponding functionsin animals. Their objects may be arrangedunder the following general heads ; each, again,admitting of further subdivision. The first endto be accomplished is to animals the food ; thatis, to convert it into a matter having the chemicalproperties of the animal substances with whichit is to be afterwards incorporated. The entirechange thus effected is termed Assimilation, ofwhich Digestion forms a principal part. Thesecond object is to collect and distribute thisprepared nutriment, which is the blood, to thedifferent organs, or wherever it may be wanted.The necessary motions for these purposes aregiven to the blood by the organs of Circulation,consisting of the Heart, which impels it througha system of pipes called Arteries, and receives itback again by means of another set of tubescalled Veins. In the third place it is necessarythat the circulating blood should continuallyundergo purification by the chemical action ofoxygen : a purpose which is answered by thefunction of Respiration. The fourth stage ofnutrition relates to the more immediate appliedTHE FUNCTIONS OF LIFE.cation of this purified material to the wants ofthe system, to the extension of the organs, to thereparation of their losses, and to the restorationof their exhausted powers.Life, then, consists of a continued series ofactions and reactions, ever varying, yet constantlytending to definite ends. Most of theparts of which the body consists undergo continualand progressive changes in their dimensions,figure, arrangement, and composition.The materials which have been united togetherand fashioned into the several organs, are themselvessuccessively removed and replaced byothers, which again are, in their turn, discarded,and new materials substituted, though without anyperceptible change of external form. Perpetualmutation appears to constitute the fundamentallaw of living nature ; and it has been furtherdecreed by the power which gave the first impulseof animation to this organized fabric, thatits movements and its powers shall be limited intheir duration, and that, even when they are notdestroyed by extraneous causes, after continuingfor a certain period, they shall come to a close.The law of Mortality, to which all the beingsthat have received the gift of life are subjected,is a necessary consequence of the law of mutation;and the same causes that originally effectedthe development and growth of the system, andmaintained it in the vigour of its maturity, byTHE FUNCTIONS OF LIFE. 43continuing to operate, are certain to lead to thedemolition of the fabric they had raised, and tothe exhaustion and final extinction of its powers.The individual dies ; but it is only to give placeto other beings, alike in nature and in form,equally partaking of the blessings of existence,and destined, after having, in their turn, givenrise to a new race of successors, to run throughthe same perpetual cycle of changes and renovations.Thus the continuance and multiplication ofeach species may be assigned as the second ofthe great ends which are to be accomplished inthe system of living nature. A portion of thevital power of the parent is for this purpose employedto give origin and birth to the offspring.The process itself, by which the germs of livingbeings originate, is veiled in the most impenetrablemystery. But we are permitted to tracemany of the subsequent steps in the gradualdevelopment both of vegetable and animalorganizations ; and certainly no part of the economyof animated nature is more calculated toimpress us with exalted ideas of the immensity ofthe scheme of Providence, and the vigilant carewith which the most distant consequences havebeen anticipated, than the history of the earlyperiods of their existence. Nothing can be moreadmirable than the progressive architecture ofthe frame ; nothing more beautiful than the44 THE FUNCTIONS OF LIFE.setting up of temporary structures, which arerequired only at an early stage of growth, andwhich are afterwards removed to give place tomore permanent and finished organs.The utmost solicitude has been shown in everypart of living nature to secure the perpetuity ofthe race, by the establishment of laws, of whichthe operation is certain in all contingent circumstances.It has also been manifestly the objectof various provisions to diffuse the races aswidely as possible over a great surface of thehabitable globe.We are next to advert to the important consequenceswhich, in the animal kingdom moreespecially, flow from this law of indefinite production.As animals are ultimately dependenton the vegetable kingdom for the materials oftheir subsistence, and as the quantity of thesematerials is, in a state of nature, necessarilylimited by the extent of surface over which vegetationis spread, a time must arrive when thenumber of animals thus continually increasingis exactly such as the amount of food producedby the earth will maintain. When thislimit has been attained, no farther increasecan take place in their number, except by resortingto the expedient which we find actuallyadopted, namely, that of employing the substanceof one animal for the nourishment ofothers. Thus the identical combinations of letheFUNCTIONS OF LIFE. 45merits, effected by the powers of vegetation, aretransformed in succession from one living beinginto another, and become subservient to themaintenance of a great number of different animalsbefore they finally, by the process of decomposition,revert to their original inorganic state.See dying vegetables life sustain,See life dissolving vegetate again ;All forms that perish other forms supply,By turns we catch the vital breath and die." — Pope.Hence has the ordinance been issued to a largeportion of the animal world that they are to maintainthemselves by preying upon other animals,either consuming their substance when alreadydead, or depriving them of life in order to prolongtheir own. Such is the command given to thecountless hosts of living beings which people thevast expanse of ocean ; to the unnumbered tribesof insects which every spot of earth discloses ; tothe greater number of the feathered race ; andalso to a more restricted order of terrestrialanimals. To many has the commission beengiven to ravage and to slaughter by open violence ;others are taught more insidious, though no lesscertain arts of destruction ; and some appearto be created chiefly for the purpose of quicklyclearing the earth of all decomposing animal orvegetable materials, which might otherwise haveH CHS Kl'NCTlONs OF LIFE.filled the air with noxious exhalations and contaminatedthe sources of vitality.*This new law of animal existence must necessarilyintroduce new conditions of organizationand of functions. Structures adapted to rapidaction must be supplied for the pursuit ol'prey, arid powerful weapons for attack andfraction. But nature has not left the weakeranimals unprovided with the means o( repulse,oi d< or of escape. For these purposesvarious expedients, cither oi force, ot seisin as,or of stratagem, have been resorted to in dimcast-thata large portion of evil is the direct consequenceo{ this sj @fc< m of extensive warfare, it isin vain to deny.

It affords a ready and effectual meansof preserving the proper balance between differentraces. Each separate species of animals, far frombeing isolated and independent, performs the partassigned to it in the system of nature, and, howeverapparently insignificant, may have a sensibleinfluence on the rest of the animal creation.Man, above all other animals, has effected amost important change in the condition of amultitude of other races, in every region wherehis numbers have multiplied, where the arts ofcivilization have enlarged his dominion, andwhere science has armed him with still moreextensive power.In every department of nature it cannot fail tostrike us that boundless variety is a characteristicand predominant feature of her productions.It is only when the object to be attainedis dependent upon certain definite conditions, excludingthe possibility of modification, that theseconditions are uniformly and strictly adhered to.48 THE FUNCTIONS OF LIFE.But wherever that absolute necessity does notexist, and there is afforded scope for deviation,there we are certain to find introduced all thosemodifications which the occasion admits of. Notonly is this tendency to variety exemplified inthe general appearance and form of the body,but it also prevails in each individual organ,however minute and insignificant that organmay seem. Even when the purpose to be answeredis identical, the means that are employedare infinitely diversified in different instances,as if a design had existed of displaying to theastonished eyes of mortals the unbounded resourcesof creative power. While the elementsof structure are the same, there is presented tousin succession every possible combination oforgans, as if it had been the object to exhaustall the admissible permutations in the order oftheir union.Some wise purpose, though dimly perceptibleto our imperfect understandings, is no doubtanswered by this great law of organic formation,the law of variety. That it is not blindly or indiscriminatelyfollowed, is apparent from itsbeing circumscribed within certain limits, andcontrolled by another law, which we have nextto consider — that of conformity to a definite type.The most superficial survey of nature is sufficientto show that there prevail certain generalresemblances among great multitudes of species,THE FUNCTIONS OF LIFE. 49which lead us to class them into more or lesscomprehensive groups. Thus in the animalkingdom, quadrupeds, birds, fishes, reptiles,shell-fish, and insects, compose natural assemblagesor classes, and each of these is readilydivisible into subordinate groups or families.Now it results from a closer examination of thestructure and economy of plants and animals,that the formation of all the individual speciescomprehended in the same class, has been conductedin conformity with a certain ideal model,or type, as it is called. Of this general type all theexisting forms appear as so many separate copies,differing, indeed, as to particulars, but agreeingas to general characters. The same observationapplies to the families, the genera, and othersubordinate groups of living beings.The more extensive our acquaintance is withthe anatomy and physiology of both plants andanimals, the more striking do these analogiesappear ; so that amidst endless diversity in thedetails of structures and of processes, the samegeneral purpose is usually accomplished by similarorgans and in similar modes. So firmly isthis principle established, that we may venturewith confidence to predict many circumstancesrelating to an unknown animal, of which onlya few fragments are presented to us, from ourgeneral knowledge of the characters and economyof the tribe or family, on the type of which it hasVOL. I. E50 THE FUNCTIONS OF LIFE.been modelled. Thus the discovery of a mutilatedportion of the skeleton of a fossil animal,gives to the physiologist, who is conversant withthe details of comparative anatomy, a knowledgeof the general structure and habits of that animal,though all other traces of its existence may havebeen swept away, amidst the primeval revolutionsof the globe.*Not only does this tendency to conform toparticular types obtain in all organic formations,but further inquiry leads to the conclusion thatthe deviations from these standard forms, farfrom being arbitrary, are themselves referable toparticular laws. The regulating principle of thevariations is subordinate to higher views, andhas reference to the respective objects and destinationof each particular species in the generalsystem of created beings. Nature, as far as wecan discern, appears, in conformity with theseintentions, first to have laid down certain greatplans of functions to which she has adapted thestructure of the organs ; the minor objects andmore subordinate functions being accommodatedto this general design. Hence arises thenecessary and reciprocal dependence of eachorgan and of each function on every other ; andhence are deduced what have been termed theSee Cuvier's " Discours sur les revolutions de la surfacedu globe," p. 47, prefixed to the first volume of his " SiemensFossiles."THE FUNCTIONS OF LIFE. 51laws of the co existence of organic forms. Byattention to these laws we may often explain howeach variation that is observed in any one organ,common to a natural group of animals, entailscertain necessary and corresponding variationsin other parts, and extends its influence in modifying,in a greater or less degree, the whole fabric.It is in comparative anatomy as in mechanics,where any alteration made in the position of onepart of a system of bodies occasions a change inthe centres of gravity, of gyration, and of oscillation; and evolves new mechanical forces andconditions of equilibrium, which render newadjustments in other parts necessary, in orderto restore the equipoise, and preserve the harmonyof their movements.We may conclude from these inquiries thatthe numerous classes or assemblages of beings,which science has formed, are by no meansarbitrary creations of the human mind, inventedmerely with a view to facilitate the study andto recognise the identity of species, or calculatedonly to supply the imperfections of our memory ;but that they have a real foundation in nature.To regard any of the beings in the creation asisolated from the rest, would be to take a verynarrow and a false view of their condition ; forall are connected by mutual relations. Evenamong the leading types which represent thegreat divisions of the animal kingdom we may52 THE FUNCTIONS OF LIFE.trace several points of resemblance, which showthem to be parts of one general plan, and tohave emanated from the same Creator. In theprogress of discovery we are continually meetingwith species which occupy intermediate placesbetween adjacent types, and appear as linksof connexion in the chain of being. It oftenhappens, as I shall hereafter have occasion topoint out, that throughout an extensive series oforganic forms, the steps of gradation by whichone type passes into another, are so numerousand so regular, as to preclude the possibility ofdrawing a decided line of demarcation betweenthose that properly appertain to each.All these apparent anomalies and gradationsof structure tend still farther to demonstrate thegenerality of the plans of nature, and the comprehensivenessof her design, which embraces thewhole series of animated beings. These viewsare strongly corroborated by the discoveriesthat are continually being made of species nowno longer in existence, but which, in formerages of the world, helped to fill up many of thechasms which now interrupt the continuity ofthat series. This knowledge has been revealedto us by the examination of their fossil remains,those monuments of former epochs, which havethrown such important light on the most interestingquestions in Geology as well as in Physiology.THE FUNCTIONS OF LIFE. 53The notion has long prevailed that the beingscomposing the vegetable and animal kingdoms,might, if we were thoroughly acquainted withtheir structure and economy, be arranged in alinear series, commencing with the simplest andregularly ascending to the most refined and complicatedorganizations, till it reached its highestpoint in man, who is unquestionably placed atthe summit of the scale. Bonnet, in particular,cherished with enthusiastic ardour the hypothesisthat all organic beings formed a continuousgradation, each member of which, likethe successive links of a chain, was connectedwith that which preceded, and with that whichfollowed it; and he pursued this idea by applyingit even to the productions of the mineralworld. But, divesting ourselves of these hypotheticalviews and figurative images, we find, onsober observation, that instead of one continuousseries, we are presented with only detached fragmentsand interrupted portions of this imaginarysystem : so that, if, for the sake of illustration, wemust employ a metaphor, the natural distributionof animals would appear to be represented, notby a chain, but by complicated net work, whereseveral parallel series are joined by transverseand oblique lines of connexion. A multitude offacts, however, tend to show that the real typesor models of structure, are more correctly representedby circular or recurring arrangedTHE FUNCTIONS OF LIFE.ments.* But as the discussion of these andother topics relating to the plans and designs ofnature in the formation of organic beings requiresa previous acquaintance with the detailsof comparative anatomy and physiology, I shalldefer all further observations respecting themtill I have finished the review I propose to takeof the several structures and functions of theanimal and vegetable economy. There are,however, some views that have been entertainedrespecting the procedure of nature in the formationof the different races of animals, which it willbe proper to notice in this place, as they willoccasionally be referred to when the facts thatmore particularly illustrate and support themcome to be noticed.An hypothesis has been advanced that theoriginal creation of species has been successive,and took place in the order of their relative complexityof structure ; that the standard typeshave arisen the one from the other; that eachsucceeding form was an improvement upon thepreceding, and followed in a certain order ofdevelopment, according to a regular plantraced by the great Author of the universe forbestowing perfection on his works. This gradesM'Leay is the author of this ingenious theory, whichhe has developed in his " Hora Entomological" and whichappears to be verified to a great extent by the modern discoveriesin comparative anatomy.THE FUNCTIONS OF LIFE.tion of structure was necessarily accompaniedby a gradation of faculties : the object of eachchange of type being to attain higher objects,and to advance a further step towards the ultimateends of the animal creation. Many apparentanomalies which are inexplicable upon anyother supposition, are easily reconcilable to thistheory. The developements of structure belongingto a particular type being always prospective,are not completed in the inferior ordersof the groupe formed upon that model, butremain more or less imperfect, although eachorgan always fully answers the particular purposeof the individual animal. But it sometimeshappens that the imperfection of an organ is sogreat, in consequence of its development havingproceeded to a very small extent, as to renderit wholly useless in that particular species, althoughin a higher race of animals it fully performsits proper function. Thus we shall findthat rudiments of feet are contained within thebodies of various kinds of serpents, which can obviouslynot be serviceable as organs of progression.In the young of the whale, before its birth,there is found in the lower jaw, a row of smallteeth, which do not rise above the gums, andcan, therefore, be of no use as instruments of mastication.Their farther growth is arrested andthey are afterwards obliterated. This imperfector rudimentary condition of an organ indicates56 THE FUNCTIONS OF LIFE.its relation to other species belonging to thesame type, and demonstrates the existence of ageneral plan in their formation. I shall haveoccasion to mention several striking instancesof this kind, both in the animal and vegetablekingdom.In following the transitions from one model ofstructure to another, we often observe that a particularorgan has been very greatly enlarged, orotherwise modified to suit some particular purpose,foreign to its usual destination, or to qualifyit for performing some new office, renderednecessary by the particular circumstances inwhich the animal is placed. Thus the ribs,which in quadrupeds are usually employed forrespiration, are in serpents converted into auxiliaryorgans of progressive motion : and in theDraco volans, or flying lizard, they are extendedoutwards from the sides to serve as wings. Theteeth, usually intended for mastication, are inmany animals enlarged in order to serve as weaponsof offence, as in the Elephant, the Boar,the Narwal, and the Prist is. In like manner inthe Crustacea, organs of the same general structureare converted sometimes into jaws, sometimesinto feelers, (or palpi) and sometimes intofeet ; and the transition from the one to theother is so gradual that it is difficult to draw aproper distinction between them.In pursuing the ascending series of animalstructures we meet also with instances of a con-theFUNCTIONS OF LIFE. 57tray change, yet still resulting from the continuedapplication of the same principle. Anorgan which has served an important purposein one animal, may be of less use in another,occupying a higher station in the scale, and thechange of circumstances may even render itwholly useless. In such cases we find that it isgradually discarded from the system, becomingcontinually smaller, till it disappears altogether.We may often, however, perceive some tracesof its existence, but only in a rudimental state,and as if ready to be developed, when theoccasion may demand it.In the greater number of organic structureswe may trace a tendency to the repetition ofcertain organs, or parts, and the regular arrangementof these similar portions either round acentral axis, or in a longitudinal series. Theformer is apparent in the verticillated organs ofplants, and in the radiated forms of zoophytes.The linear arrangement is exhibited in the similarsegments of annulose and other articulatedanimals, and also in the pieces which composethe spinal column of vertebrated animals. Inthese two latter classes, also, a remarkable lawof symmetry obtains in the formation of the twosides of the body, which exhibits the lateraljunction of similar but reversed structures. Theviolations of this law are extremely rare ; yetsome remarkable instances of anomalous formationsin this respect will hereafter be noticed.58 THE FUNCTIONS OF LIFE.In treating of the particular functions of theanimal and vegetable economy I shall follow adifferent order from that in which I have presentedthem in the preceding sketch. As theMechanical functions depend upon the simplerproperties of matter and the well known laws ofmechanism, I think it best to commence with theexamination of these. Our attention will nextbe directed to the highly interesting subjectswhich relate to the Nutritive or Vital functionsboth of vegetable and animal structures : for asthey involve the chemical properties of organizedsubstances, and are, therefore, of a more refinedand intricate nature than the preceding, Iconceive they will be best understood after thegeneral mechanism of the frame has been explained.These studies will prepare us for theconsideration of living animals as sentient andactive beings, endowed by their bounteous Creatorwith the exalted faculties of perception andof volition, which alone give value to existence,and which raise them so far above the level ofthe vegetable world. I shall lastly give a verybrief account of the reproductive functions, andof the phenomena of animal development, inwhich the discoveries of modern times have revealedto us so considerable a portion of thoseextensive plans which an all-wise providencehas beneficently devised for the general welfareof animated beings.PART I.THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.Chapter I. — Organic Mechanism.§ 1 . Organization in General.Life, which consists of a continued series ofactions directed to particular purposes, cannotbe carried on but by the instrumentality of thosepeculiar and elaborate structures and combinationsof material particles which constitute organization.All these arrangements, both asrespects the mechanical configuration and thechemical constitution of the elements of whichthe organized body is composed, even whenapparently most simple, are, in reality, complexand artificial in the highest possible degree.Let us take as a specimen the crystalline lens,or hard central part, of the eye of a cod fish,which is a perfectly transparent, and to allappearance homogeneous, spherule. No one,unaccustomed to explore the wonders of nature,would suspect that so simple a body, which he60 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.might suppose to be formed of a uniform materialcast in a mould, would disclose, when examinedunder a powerful microscope, and with theskill of a Brewster, the most refined and exquisiteconformation. Yet, as I shall have occasionto specify more in detail in its proper place, thislittle spherical body, scarcely larger than a pea,is composed of upwards of five millions of fibres,which lock into one another by means of morethan sixty-two thousand five hundred millions ofteeth. If such be the complication of a portiononly of the eye of that animal, how intricatemust be the structure of the other parts of thesame organ, having equally important offices !What exquisite elaboration must those textureshave received whose functions are still morerefined ! What marvellous workmanship musthave been exercised in the organization of thenerves and of the brain, those subtle instrumentsof the higher animal faculties, and of whicheven the modes of action are to us not merelyinscrutable, but surpassing all our powers ofconception !It is from the energies of life alone that organicforms are produced. No fabric achievedby human power ever approached in refinementthe simplest of nature's works. The utmostefforts of the ingenuity or skill of man in theconstruction of the most delicate machinery isinfinitely surpassed by the most ordinary of theORGANIC MECHANISM. 61mechanisms which are presented to our viewin living bodies. However successful may behuman artists in their attempts to contrive automata,which shall exactly imitate differentanimal movements, there will always be wantingthat internal principle of action, derived from ahigher source than mechanism can supply, andwithout which these highly wrought works ofman, like the un vivified statues of Prometheus,must remain for ever mere masses of insentientand inert materials.As the living functions imply the mechanicalaction and reaction of parts which cohere insome definite order of arrangement, so as topreserve that determinate form to which theyconstantly tend to return on being displaced,it is impossible to conceive that a mere fluidcan exercise these functions ; because the particlesof a fluid, being equally moveable inevery direction, have no determinate relativesituations, and possess no character of permanence.All organic and living structures, therefore,must be composed of solid as well as fluidparts ; although the proportion between these is,in different cases, almost infinitely varied. Adormant vitality may, indeed, exist in a systemof organs which have been brought into a perfectlydry state : as is proved by the examplesof vegetable seeds, and also of many species ofanimalcules, and even of some of the more02 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.highly developed Annelida, or worms, whichmay be kept in a dry state for an indefinitelength of time, and, when moistened with water,resume their activity, as if restored to life. Thegermination of seeds under these circumstancesis matter of common observation ; but the revivificationof animalcules is a more curious phenomenon,for it takes place more rapidly, and ismore striking in its results. The Rotifer redivivus,or wheel animalcule,* (Fig. 1 .) which wasfirst observed by Leeuwenhoek, and was afterwardsrendered celebrated by the experimentsmade upon it by Spallanzani, can live only inwater, and is commonly found in that which hasremained stagnant for some time in the guttersof houses.

Vegetable Organization,Plants, being limited in their economy to thefunctions of nutrition and reproduction, andbeing fixed to the same spot, and therefore in acomparatively passive condition, require for theperformance of these functions mechanical constructionsof a very different kind from thosewhich are necessary to the sentient, the active,and the locomotive animal. The organs that areessential to vegetables are those which receiveand elaborate the nutritive fluids they require,those which are subservient to reproduction,and also those composing the general framework,which must be superadded to the wholefor the purpose of giving mechanical supportand protection to these finer organizations. Asplants are destined to be permanently attachedto the soil, and yet require the action bothof air and of light; and, as they must alsobe defended from the injurious action of theelements, so we find these several objects providedfor by three descriptions of parts : namely,first, the Roots, which fix plants in their situa-vol.I.

Fig. 3 is a highly magnifiedrepresentation of the simplest form of thesevesicles.* But they generally adhere togethermore closely, composing by their union a speciesof vegetable cellular tissue, which may be regardedas the basis or essential component materialof every organ in the plant. This cellularstructure is represented in figures 4 and 5, as itappears in the Fucus vesiculosus ; the first beinga horizontal, and the second a vertical sectionof that plant. | The size of these cells differsconsiderably in different instances. Kieser statesthat the diameter of each individual cell variesfrom the 330th to the 55th part of an inch ; soThese cells are well represented in the engravings whichillustrate Mr. Slack's memoir on the elementary tissue of plants,contained in the 49th volume of the Transactions of the Societyof Arts.f De Candolle, Organographie Vegetate.VEGETABLE ORGANIZATION.(37that from 3,000 to 100,000 cells would be containedin an extent of surface equal to a squareinch. But they are occasionally met with of differentsizes, from even the tooth part of aninch to the 30th.In their original state, these vesicles havean oval or globular form ; but they are soontransformed into other shapes, either by themutual compression which they sustain frombeing crowded into a limited space, or fromunequal expansions in the progress of theirdevelopment. From the first of these causesthey often acquire angles, assuming the forms ofirregular rhomboidal dodecahedrons, and oftenof hexagonal prisms, like the cells of a honeycomb; and by the second, they are elongated68 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.into cylinders, or slowly tapering cones, thuspassing by insensible gradations into the tubularform. Figures 6, 7, and 8, are representationsof some of these different states of transition fromthe one to the other. These various modificationsof the same elementary texture have beendistinguished into several classes of cells, anddignified by separate technical denominations,which I shall not stop to specify, as it does notappear that they have as yet thrown any lighton vegetable physiology.Many of the cells are fortified by the additionof elastic threads, generally disposed in a spiralcourse, and adhering to the inner surfaces of themembranous coats of the cells, which they keepin an expanded state. (See Fig. 9.) When themembranes are torn, the fibres, being detached,enrol themselves, and being loosely scatteredamong the neighbouring cells, give the appearanceof fibrous connexions among these cells,which did not originally exist. Simple membranouscells, containing no internal threads,are often found intermixed with these fibrouscells. In many of the cells, again, the originalspiral threads appear to have coalesced by theiredges ; thus presenting a more uniform surface,excepting that a few interstices are left, wherethe pellucid membrane, having no internallining, presents the appearance of transversefissures or oval perforations.

CellsVEGETABLE ORGANIZATION. 09of this description are said to be reticulated orspotted, and, together with those having moreregularly formed spiral threads, are very abundantlymet with in plants belonging to the tribeof Architect.It has been much disputed whether the cellsof the vegetable texture are closed on all sides,or whether they communicate with one another.Mirbel has given us delineations of what appearedto him, when he examined the coats ofthe cells with the microscope, to be pores andfissures. But subsequent observations haverendered it probable that these appearancesarise merely from darker portions of the membranes,where opaque particles have been depositedin their substance. Fluids gain accessinto these cells by transuding through the membraneswhich form their sides, and not by anyapertures capable of being detected by thehighest powers of the microscope.If all the cells consist of separate vesicles,as the concurring observations of modern botanists*appear to have satisfactorily established,the partitions which separate them, however thinand delicate, must consist of a double membrane,formed by the adhesion of the coats of the twocontiguous vesicles. But as these coats canIn particular, Treviranus, Kieser, Link, Du Petit Hours,Polling, Amici, Dutrochet, and De Candolle.70 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.hardly be supposed to adhere in every point, wemay expect to find that spaces have been leftin various parts between them ; and that communicationsexist to a certain extent betweenall these spaces ; so as to compose what mayberegarded as one large cavity.

But thegreater number of other plants have, in additionto these cells, numerous ducts or vessels, consistingof membranous tubes of considerablelength, interspersed throughout every part of thesystem. These tubes exhibit different modificationsof structure, more especially with regardto the form of the fibres, or other materials,which adhere to the inner surface of their membranes; and these modifications correspond veryexactly with those of the vesicles already describedas constituting the simpler forms ofvegetable tissue. There can be little doubt,indeed, that the vessels of plants take theirorigin from vesicles, which become elongated bythe progress of development in one particulardirection ; and it is easy to conceive that wherethe extremities of these elongated cells meet,72 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.the partitions which separate their cavities maybecome obliterated at the points of junction,so as to unite them into one continuous tubewith an uninterrupted interior passage. Thisview of the formation of the vessels of plants isconfirmed by the gradation that may be tracedamong these various kinds of structures. Elongatedcells are often met with applied to eachother endwise, as if preparatory to their coalescenceinto tubes. Sometimes the tapering endsof fusiform cells are joined laterally (as seen inFig. 12), so that the partitions which divide theircavities are oblique. At other times their endsare broader, and admit of their more direct applicationto each other in the same line, beingseparated only by membranes passing transversely; in which case they present, under themicroscope, the appearance of a necklace ofbeads (Fig. 13). When, by the destruction ofthese partitions, their cavities become continuous,the tubes they form exhibit a series ofcontractions at certain intervals, marking theirorigin from separate cells. In this state theyhave received the names of moniliform, jointedor beaded vessels* Traces of the membranouspartitions sometimes remain where their obliterationhas been only partial, leaving transversefibres. The conical terminations occasionallyMirbel gave them the name of " Vaisscaux en chaplet"VEGETABLE ORGANIZATION.observable in the vessels of plants also indicatetheir cellular origin.*12 1315 16 17uThe membrane constituting the tube is sometimessimple, like those of the simple cells : butit frequently contains fibres, or other internalcoatings, corresponding to those met with in themore compound cells. The vessels in which theinternal fibres run in a spiral direction (Fig. 14),are denominated trachea, or spiral vessels; or,from their being found very constantly to containair, they are often called air tubes. Theirdiameter is generally between the tooth and thesooth part of an inch. These spiral, or air vessels,pervade extensively the vegetable system.The threads they contain are frequently double,treble, quadruple, or even still more numerous :they are of great length, and when the externalmembrane of the vessel is divided, they mayThis theory of the derivation of vessels from cells was firstadvanced by Treviranus.THE Mere \ -easily be drawn out and uncoiled, their tcity enabling them to retain their spiral shape.The object of this structure appears to be thatof keeping die cavity of the tube always pervious,by presenting resistance to any externalforce tending to compress and close it.*In many instances the inner fib - tube,instead of forming a continuous spiral, appear inthe shape of rings, succeeding one another atregular intervals,, and constituting what arecalled angular vessels (Fig. 1 5 They are generallylarger than the spiral vessels.

The density of the woody fibresincreases in proportion as these incrustations areformed, till they have become nearly impervious ;and have acquired a degree of rigidity peculiarlyfitting them for the office of giving mechanicalsupport to the fabric of the plant.* Their assemblagethus constitutes a kind of frame-work forthe whole system, which may be regarded as theskeleton of the plant. Thus, what are called thefibres of leaves (Fig. 19), are principally composedof these woody fibres, distributed in themanner best adapted to support the expansionof the soft and pulpy substance of those importantorgans.Besides the minute cavities of the cellulartissue, there occur, in various parts of a plant,much larger spaces, apparently serving thepurpose of reservoirs of particular fluids ; butsometimes containing only air.

The cuticleis formed originally by the condensation of alayer of cellular tissue, of which the cells, beingconsolidated by exposure to the air, and bycompression, compose a thin but imperviouspellicle. Amici has distinctly shown, by meansof his powerful microscope, the cellular structureof the cuticle, and also that the layer of cellsof which it consists is independent of the subjacentcellular tissue.* Fig. 20 is intended toshow this circumstance, the shaded part representingthe cuticle with its series of cells.Oval orifices, or stomata, as they have beentermed, are discoverable on almost every part ofAnnales des Sciences Naturelles, II. 211.78 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.the surface of the cuticle, but more especiallyin those that have a green colour.* They areplaced at nearly equal distances from one another,and are particularly numerous in thecuticle of the leaves, where they occupy theintervals between the fibres. These orificesconduct into the interior of the plant, probablyinto the general cavity of the intercellularspaces. It is evident, from the functions theyperform, that they must occasionally open andclose ; but the minuteness of their size precludesany accurate observation as to the nature of theapparatus provided for the purpose of performingthese motions. Amici describes their marginsas formed by two cells, by the movements ofwhich, combined perhaps with those of theadjoining cells, he conceives these orifices areopened and closed. | Great variety, however,is observable in the structure of the stomata indifferentspecies of plants.Many plants have no stomata, either on thecuticle of the leaves, or on that of the stem.This is the case with such aquatic plants as arehabitually immersed in water. In those thatare only partially immersed, stomata are metFig. 22 is a magnified representation of the appearancein the cuticle of the Lycopodium denticulatum, taken in thecentral part of the lower surface of the leaf, from De Candolle.Fig. 21 is a still more magnified view of the stomata in the leafof the Lilium candid, from Amici.f Ibid.

The leaves of the Ranunculusaquatic, when made to grow in the air, acquirestomata, but lose them entirely when growingunder water. Stomata are wanting in all plantswhose structure is wholly cellular.Botanists are far from being agreed as to theprecise functions which the stomata perform.Their usual office undoubtedly is to exhalewater ; but they probably also absorb air undercertain circumstances, and in particular exigences.The principal organs through which thefluids that serve for nourishment are receivedinto the system of plants, are those situated atthe extremities of the roots, where they aretermed, from their peculiar texture, spangles*Fig. 23 exhibits the termination of a root of a willow in aspongiole ; the arrangement of the cells composing which isshewn in Fm 24, from De Candolle.80 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.Of the functions of spangles in absorbing fluidsI shall have occasion to speak when treating ofnutrition. But as the roots exercise a mechanicalas well as a nutrient office, we should hereconsider them in the light of organs adaptedto procure to the plant a permanent attachmentto the soil, upon which it is wholly dependentfor its supply of nourishment. It is scarcelynecessary to point out how effectually they performthis office. Our admiration cannot fail tobe excited when we contemplate the manner inwhich a large tree is chained to the earth by itspowerful and widely spreading roots. By thefirm hold which they take of the ground, theyprocure the most effectual resistance to the forceof the winds, which, acting upon so large asurface as that presented by the branchescovered with dense foliage, must possess animmense mechanical power.The principal seat of the vitality of a plant isthe part which intervenes between the root andthe stem. Injuries to this part are always fatalto the life of the plant.As the roots penetrate downwards into theearth to different distances in order to procurethe requisite nourishment, so the stem growsupwards for the purpose of obtaining for theleaves and flowers an ample supply of air, andthe influence of a brighter light, both of whichare of the highest importance to the maintenanceVEGETABLE ORGANIZATION. 81of vegetable life.

Of all thepossible modes of disposing a given quantityof materials in the construction of a column,it is mathematically demonstrable that this isthe most effective for obtaining the greatestpossible degree of strength.*The graceful continuous curve with which thestem of a tree rises from the ground, is theform which is best calculated to give stabilityto the trunk. Evidence of express mechanicaldesign is likewise afforded by the manner inwhich the trunk is subdivided into its branches,spreading out in all directions, manifestly with aview to procure for the leaves the greatest extentof surface, and thus enable them to receive thefullest action of both light and air. The branches,also, are so constructed as to yield to the irregularimpulses of the wind, and again, by theirelasticity, to return to their natural positions,and by these alternate inflexions on oppositesides, to promote the motion of the sap in thevessels and cellular texture of the liber andGalileo, the most profound philosopher of his age, wheninterrogated by the inquisition as to his belief in a SupremeBeing, replied, pointing to a straw on the floor of his dungeon,that from the structure of that object alone he would infer withcertainty the existence of an intelligent Creator.VOL.

Development of Vegetables.Farther proofs of design may be collected froman examination into the modes in which thesestructures, so admirably adapted to their objects,have been gradually formed. Confining ourattention to vascular plants, in which the processof development has been studied with thegreatest attention and success, we find thatNature has pursued two different plans inDEVELOPEMENT OF VEGETABLES. 83conducting their growth.* In the greater number,the successive additions to the substanceof the stem are made on the exterior side of theparts from which they proceed. This mode isadopted in what are called Exogenous plants. Inothers, the growth is the result of additions madeinternally ; a plan which is followed in all Endogenousplants. The Oak, the Elm, the Beech,the Pine, and all the trees of these northernregions, belong to the first of these divisions.The Palm tribe, such as the Date, the Cocoa-nuttree, and, indeed, a large proportion of the treesof tropical climates, together with the sugarcane,the bamboo, and all gramineous and liliaceousplants, belong to the latter. We shall firstinquire into the endogenous mode of growth,as being the simplest of these two kinds of vegetabledevelopment.A Palm tree may be taken as an example ofthe mode of growth in endogenous plants. Thestem of this tree is usually perfectly cylindrical,attains a great height, and bears on its summit atuft of leaves. It is composed of an extremelydense external cylindric layer of wood ; butthe texture of the interior becomes graduallyThe tribe of Flies, or ferns, the structure of which isvascular, constitute an exception to this rule : as they differ intheir mode of development, both from exogenous and endogenousplants.84 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.softer and more porous as it comes nearer to thecentre ; though with regard to its essential characterit appears to be uniform in every part,having neither medullary rays, nor true outwardbark, nor any central pith ; in all which respectsit differs totally from the ordinary exogenoustrees.The first stage of its growth consists in theappearance of a circle of leaves, which shootupwards from the neck of the plant, and attain,during the first year, a certain size. The followingyear, another circle of leaves arises ; but theygrow from the interior of the former circle, whichthey force outwards as their vegetation advances,and as ligneous matter is deposited within them.Thus each succeeding year brings with it a freshcrop of leaves, intermixed with ligneous matter,which leaves, exerting an outward pressure,stretch out the preceding layers that enclosethem ; until the latter, acquiring greater density,no longer admit of further distention, and remainpermanently fixed. This happens first tothe outermost layer, which is the oldest : theneach succeeding layer becomes consolidated inits turn. As soon as the outer layer has becometoo hard to yield to the pressure from within, thegrowth of the inner layers is immediately directedupwards ; so that they each rise in succession bydistinct stages, always proceeding from the interior; a mode of development which has beenDEVELOPEMENT OF VEGETABLES. 85compared by De Candolle to the drawing outof the sliding tubes of a telescope. The wholestem, whatever height it may attain, never increasesits diameter after its outward layer hasbeen consolidated. A circle of leaves annuallysprouts from the margin of the new layer ofwood ; these, when they fall off in autumn, leaveon the stem certain traces of their former existence,consisting of a circular impression roundthe stem. The age of the tree may accordinglybe estimated by the number of these circles, orknots, which appear along its stem. The successiveknots which are seen in the stems ofother endogenous plants, as may be observed ingrowing corn, and also in various grasses, maybetraced to a similar origin.The structure of exogenous trees is more complicated: for, when fully grown, they are composedof two principal parts, the wood and thebark. The woody portion exhibits a furtherdivision into the pith, which occupies thecentre, and consists of large vesicles, not coheringvery closely, but forming a light andspongy texture, readily permeable to liquidsand to air ; the harder ivood, which surroundsthe pith in concentric rings, or layers ; and thesofter wood, or alburnum, which is also disposedin concentric layers on the outer side of theformer. Each of these concentric layers ofwood and of alburnum may be further distinctTHE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.gushed into an inner and an outer portion ; theformer being of less density than the latter, andconsisting of a lighter cellular tissue : while theouter portion is composed of the denser woodyfibres resulting from the union of numerousvessels with a cellular envelope. The bark isformed by concentric layers of cortical substance,of which the innermost are denominated theLiber ; and the whole is surrounded by an outerzone of cellular tissue, termed the cellular envelope.Of this envelope the exterior surface iscalled the Epidermis.All these concentric zones may be readilydistinguished in a horizontal section of thestem ; which also presents a number of linescalled Medullary Rays, radiating from the pithto the circumference. They are composedchiefly of large cells, extending transversely,or in the direction of the diameter of the tree,and composing by their union continuous verticalplanes the whole length of the trunk.Every vegetable stem, and also every branchwhich arises from it, is developed from a germ,or bud, which is originally of inconceivable minuteness,and totally imperceptible by any opticalmeans of which we have the command.As soon as it becomes visible, and its structurecan be distinguished, it is found to containwithin itself the parts which are to arise from it,in miniature, and folded up in the smallest posseOF VEGETABLES. 87able compass. The portion destined to form thestem is gradually expanded both in breadth andheight, but principally the latter, so that it risesas it grows, during a certain period, until thefibres acquire the solidity and strength necessarynot only for their own support, but also forsustaining the parts which are to be furtheradded. In trees this process generally occupiesone whole season ; during which the growth ofthe first layer of wood, with its central pith, andits covering of a layer of bark, is free and unrestrained.On the second year, a fresh impulsebeing given to vegetation, a new growth commencesfrom the upper end of the original stem,as if it were the development of a new bud :and at the same time a layer of cellular tissue isformed by the deposition of new materials onthe outside of the former wood, and between itand the bark. This is followed by a secondlayer of wood, enveloping the new layer of cellulartissue.The effect of this new growth is to compressthe layer of wood which had been formed duringthe first year, and to impede its further extensionin breadth. But as its fibres, consisting of vesselsand cells, are not yet consolidated, and admit ofstill greater expansion as long as they are suppliedwith nourishment, their growth, which isrestrained laterally, is now directed upwards,and there is no farther enlargement of their88 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.diameter. From the same cause the pith cannotincrease in size ; and is even found to diminishby the pressure of the surrounding wood. Thusthe vertical elongation of the entire stem continuesduring the whole of the second year, andthe trunk becomes sufficiently strengthened bythe addition of the second layer on its outsideto bear this increase of its height.While this process is going on in the wood,corresponding changes take place in the bark,and a new layer is added on its inner surface,or that which is contiguous to the wood. Thislayer constitutes the liber* All these new depositionsmust of course tend to stretch the outerportions of the bark, which had been first formed,and which yield to this pressure to a certainextent; but, becoming themselves consolidatedby the effects of the same pressure, they acquireincreasing rigidity ; and, the same cause continuingto operate, they at length give way,in various places, forming those deep cracks,which are observable in the bark of old trees,and which give so rugged an appearance totheir surface. The cuticle has, long before this,peeled off, and has been succeeded by the consolidatedlayers of cortical envelope which formthe epidermis. But the epidermis, which is continuallysplitting by the expansion of the partsit encloses, itself soon decays, and is constantlysucceeded by fresh layers, produced by theDEVELOPEMENT OF VEGETABLES. 89same process of consolidation in the subjacentcortical substance.During the third and each succeeding year,the same process is repeated ; new layers ofcellular texture and of woody fibres are depositedaround those of the preceding year's growth, anda new internal coating is given to the liber of thebark. The compressing power continues to beexerted on the internal layers of wood, directingtheir growth vertically, while they are capableof elongation, and can be supplied with nourishment.In time, however, by continued pressure,and accumulating depositions of solid matter,the vessels and the cells become less and lesspervious to fluids ; till at length all further dilatationis prevented. But the tree still continuesto enlarge its trunk by the annual accessions ofvigorous and expansible alburnum, and to takeits station among its kindred inhabitants of theforest; till, arriving at maturity, its majesticform towers above all the junior or less vigoroustrees.*The development of each branch takes placein the same manner, and by the same kind ofIt is contended by Dr. Darwin and other writers on vegetablephysiology that each annual shoot should be regarded asacollection of individual buds, each bud being a distinct individualplant, and the whole tree an aggregation of such individuals.I shall have occasion to revert to this question when I come toconsider the subject of vegetable nutrition.90 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.process, as that of the trunk. The buds fromwhich they originate, spring from the angleformed by the stalk which supports a leaf, andwhich is termed by botanists the axilla of thatleaf. A law of symmetry is established bynature in the development of all the partsof plants. The leaves, in particular, are frequentlyobserved to arise in a circle, or symmetricallyround the parent stem ; forming whatis termed a ivhorl, or, in botanical language, aver titillated arrangement. In other cases theyare found to have their origins at equal intervalsof a spiral line, which may be conceived to bedrawn along the stem, or the branch from whichthey grow. When these intervals correspond tothe semi-circumference of the stem, the leavesalternate with one another on its opposite sides.The stems of most plants, even those that areperfectly erect, exhibit a tendency to a spiralgrowth. This is observable in the fibres of thewood of the pine, however straight may be thedirection of the whole trunk. This tendency isshown even in the epidermis of the cherry tree,for it may be stripped off with more facility inaspiral direction than in any other. The primitivedirection of the leaves of endogenousplants is a spiral one. It is particularly markedalso in the stems of creepers and of parasiticplants, which are generally twisted throughouttheir whole length ; a disposition evidently conduciveto the purpose of their formation, namely,DEVELOPEMENT OF VEGETABLES. 91that of laying hold of the objects with whichthey come in contact, and of twining round themin search both of nourishment and of support.The twisted stems of the hop and of ivy showthis structure in a remarkable degree, and thepurpose for which this tendency was given cannotbe mistaken.A conjecture has been offered that this tendencyto a spiral growth might be the effectof the influence of the sun's light, acting successivelyon different sides of the plant, in thecourse of its diurnal motion. In these northernlatitudes the direction of that motion is from eastto west ; or, to an observer facing the south, fromleft to right. That light has a powerful influencein determining the direction of the growth of allthe parts of the plant which are above ground, ismanifest to every one who has observed thehabits of vegetables. If a growing plant beplaced in a situation where the light reaches itonly on one side, it will always, by degrees, turnitself to that side, as if eagerly pressing forwardto obtain the beneficial action of that agent.The leaves, whose functions in a more especialmanner require its operation, will always befound turned towards the light. The branchesof a tree, which have naturally a tendency to risevertically, have this tendency modified by thesuperior attraction of the light, when it canreach them only laterally. Thus while those onthe upper part spread out in full luxuriance in92 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.all directions, those below them are obliged toexpand more in a lateral direction : and this isstill more the case with the lowest branches,which shoot out horizontally to a considerabledistance before they turn upwards, and presenttheir leaves to the light. Often, however, fromthe deficiency of this necessary agent, theirgrowth is much stinted, or entirely prevented.The operation of this cause is extensively seen inthe interior of a dense forest.It may be objected to the theory of the spiralgrowth being the result of the sun's motion, thatwere it so, the direction of the spiral wouldalways be the same, that is, ascending from leftto right with reference to the axis. But this isnot found to be the case, for the direction of theturns, though generally constant in the sameplant, is far from being the same in all. Dr.Wollaston ingeniously suggested that a verificationof the theory would be obtained were itfound that plants transported from the southernto the northern hemispheres, would have thisdirection reversed ; for it is evident that themotion of the sun's light in the two hemispheresis in opposite directions ; being, in the southernhemisphere, from right to left, to a spectatorfacing the meridian position of the sun, whichin those regions is to the north. But, the factsare not in accordance with this view of the subject; so that we may consider the hypothesisas untenable.DEVELOPEMENT OF VEGETABLES. 93The roots differ considerably from the stemsboth in their structure, and in their mode ofgrowth. They exhibit, indeed, the appearanceof medullary rays and of concentric layers, butthey are destitute of any central pith, and theyhave no tracheae ; neither does their surfacepresent any appearance of stomata. They increasein thickness in the same way as the stemincreases. This law obtains both in exogenousand endogenous plants: they do not, however,grow in length by the elongation of any of theirparts, but simply by additions made to theirextremities. Their ramifications are not theresult of the development of buds, as are thebranches of the stem ; but they arise merelyfrom the additional deposits taking different directions.Almost every part of the surface of thestem or branches may shoot forth roots if theyare covered with earth, and properly moistened,and if they are supplied with sap from the circulatingsystem of the plant itself. It is observed,however, that they generally grow fromcertain points on the surface of the bark, whichappear as dark spots, and are termed Lenticellce*Great variety exists in the form and dispositionof roots in different families of plants, accordingto the particular purposes they are intended toserve, conformably to their general functions ofThis name was given to them by De Candolle, Annales desSciences Naturally, VII, 1. and Organographie, I, 94.94 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.absorption and of mechanical support. Boththese purposes are promoted by their sendingout from their sides numerous fibrils, or lesserroots, which increase their firm hold upon thesoil, as well as multiply the channels for theintroduction of nourishment.Nature has supplied various plants with certainappendages to the above mentioned structures,the use of which are for the most partsufficiently obvious. Of this description are thetendrils, which assist in fixing and procuringsupport to the stems of the weaker plants ; thestipulate, which protect the nascent leaves; andthe practice, which perform a similar office to theblossom. The different kinds of hairs, of down,*of thorns, and prickles, which are found on thesurface of different plants, have various uses;some of which are easily understood, particularlythat of defending the plant from molestationby animals. The sting of the nettle is ofthis class ; and its structure bears a strikinganalogy, as we shall afterwards have occasion tonotice, to that of the poisonous fangs of serpents.The purposes answered by the down, whichcovers a great number of plants, are not veryobvious. It perhaps serves as a protection fromthe injurious effects of cold winds on the tendersurface : or it may have a relation to the deposefiner hairs, and filaments of down, are composed ofelongated cells, either single, or*several conjoined end to end.DEVELOPEMENT OF VEGETABLES. 95sit ion of moisture ; or, as it may be further conjectured,the number of points which are thuspresented to the air may be designed to conveyelectricity from the atmosphere, or to restore theelectric equilibrium, which may have been disturbedby the processes of vegetation.In the smaller parts of plants, as in the generalfabric of the whole, we find, on examination,the most admirable provision made, accordingto the particular circumstances of thecase, for the mechanical objects of cohesion,support and defence. Thus the substance ofthe leaf, of which the functions require that alarge surface be expanded to the air and light,is spread out in a thin layer upon a frame workof fibres, like rays, connected by a net-work ofsmaller fibrils, and constituting what is oftencalled the skeleton of the leaf.In all these vegetable structures, while theobjects appear to be the same, the utmost varietyis displayed in the means for their accomplishment,in obedience, as it were, to the law of diversitywhich, as has been already observed, seemsto be a leading principle in all the productionsof nature. It is more probable, however, judgingfrom that portion of the works of creation, whichwe are competent to understand, that a specificdesign has regulated each existing variation ofform, although that design may in general beutterly beyond the limited sphere of our intelligence.96 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.§ 4. Animal Organization.The structures adapted to the purposes of vegetablelife, which are limited to nutrition andreproduction, would be quite insufficient for theexercise of the more active functions and higherenergies of animal existence. The power oflocomotion, with which animals are to be invested,must alone introduce essential differences in theirorganization, and must require a union ofstrength and flexibility in the parts intendedfor extensive motion, and for being acted uponby powerful moving forces.The animal, as well as the vegetable fabric isnecessarily composed of a union of solid andfluid parts. Every animal texture appears to beformed from matter that was originally in afluid state ; the particles of which they are composedhaving been brought together and afterwardsconcreting by a process, which may, by ametaphor borrowed from physical science, betermed animal crystallization. Many of thoseanimals, indeed, which occupy the lowest rankinthe series, such as Reduce, approach nearlyto the fluid state ; appearing like a soft andtransparent jelly, which by spontaneous decompositionafter death, or by the application ofANIMAL ORGANIZATION. 97heat, is resolved almost wholly into a limpidwatery fluid.* More accurate examination, however,will show that it is in reality not homogeneous,but that it consists of a large proportionof water, retained in a kind of spongy texture,the individual fibres of which, from their extremefineness and uniformity of distribution, can withdifficulty be detected. Thus even those animalfabrics, which on a superficial view appear mostsimple, are in reality formed by an extremely artificialand complex arrangement of parts. Theprogress of development is continually tendingto solidify the structure of the body. In thisrespect the lower orders of the animal kingdom,even when arrived at maturity, resemble theconditions of the higher classes at the earlieststages of their existence. As we rise in thescale of animals, we approximate to the conditionof the more advanced states of developmentwhich are exhibited in the highest class.Great efforts have been made by physiologiststo discover the particular structure which mightbe considered as the simplest element of all theanimal textures ; the raw material, as it were,with which the whole fabric is wrought : butThus a Medusa, weighing twenty or thirty pounds, will, bythis sort of general liquefaction, be found reduced to only a fewgrains of solid matter.

H98 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.their labours have hitherto been fruitless. Fancifulhypotheses in abundance might be adducedon this favourite topic of speculation ; but theyhave led to no useful or satisfactory result.Haller, who pursued the inquiry with greatardour, came to the conclusion that there existedwhat he calls the simple or primordial fibre,which he represents as bearing to anatomy thesame relation that a line does to geometry.Chemical analysis alone is sufficient to overturnall these hypotheses of the uniformity of theproximate elementary materials of the animalorgans : for they are found to be extremely diversifiedin their chemical composition. Neitherhas the microscope enabled us to resolve theproblem: for although it has been alleged bymany observers that the ultimate elements ofevery animal structure consists of minute globules,little confidence is to be placed in theseresults obtained by the employment of highmagnifying powers, which are open to so manysources of fallacy. That globules exist in greatnumbers, not only in the blood, but in all animalfluids, there can be no doubt: and thatthese globules, by cohering, compose many ofthe solids, is also extremely probable. But it isvery doubtful whether they are essential to thecomposition of other parts, such as the fibres ofthe muscles, the nerves, the ligaments, the tendons,and the cellular texture : for the mostANIMAL ORGANIZATION. 9.9recent, and apparently most accurate microscopicalobservations tend to show that no globularstructure exists in any of these textures.*The element which we can recognise withoutdifficulty as composing the greater portion ofanimal structures, is that which is known by thename of the cellular texture. Although bearingthe same designation as the elementary materialof the vegetable fabric, it differs widely fromit in its structure and mechanical properties.It is not, like that of plants, composed of aunion of vesicles ; but is formed of a congeriesof extremely thin lamina?, or plates, variouslyconnected together by fibres, and by other plates25 which cross them in different directions,leaving cavities or cells. (Fig,25). These cells, or rather interveningspaces, communicate freely withone another ; and, in fact, may beconsidered as one common cavity,subdivided by an infinite number of partitionsinto minute compartments. Hence the cellulartexture is throughout readily permeable to fluidsof all kinds, and retains these fluids in the manner,and on the same principle, as a sponge.The cellular texture is not only the element,or essential material employed by nature in theSee the Appendix to Dr. Hodgkin and Dr. Fisher's translationof Edwards's work on the Influence of Physical Agents on Life,p. 440.100 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.construction of all the parts of the animalfabric ; but, in its simplest form, it constitutesthe general medium of connexion betweenadjacent organs, and also between the severalparts of the same organ. Like the mortarwhich unites the stones of a building, the cellulartexture is the universal cement employedto bind together all the solid structures. Itsproperties are admirably adapted to the mechanicalpurposes which are required in differentparts of the frame : and these propertiesare variously modified and adjusted to suit theparticular exigencies of the case. When, forinstance, different parts require to be moveableupon each other, the cellular substance interposedbetween them has its state of condensationadapted to the degree of motion required. Thatwhich connects the muscles, or surrounds thejoints, and all other parts concerned in extensiveaction, has a looser texture, being formed ofbroad and extensible plates, with few lateraladhesions, and leaving large interstices ; whilein the more quiescent organs, the plates of thecellular substance are thin and small, the fibresshort and slender, and their intertexture closerand more condensed.Besides being flexible and extensible, the cellulartexture is also highly elastic, a propertywhich is exceedingly advantageous in the constructionof the frame. Not only the displace-animalORGANIZATION. 101ment of parts is resisted by their elasticity, but,when displaced, they tend to return to theirnatural position. This property performs amore important part in the mechanism of theanimal than of the vegetable system ; as might,indeed, have been anticipated from the moreactive and energetic movements required by thefunctions of the former.The cellular texture, in its simple form, admitsof the ready transmission of fluids through it ;but it is necessary, on many occasions, to interposea barrier to their passage. Such barriersare provided in membranes, which are merelymodifications of the same material, spread outinto a continuous sheet of a closer texture, afterthe surfaces of the plates have been brought tocohere so as to obliterate all the cellular interstices,and become impervious to fluids.Though equally flexible and elastic with the originaltexture of which it is formed, the membranehas acquired, by this consolidation, greaterstrength and firmness, properties which adaptit to a great number of important purposes.*Membranes are extensively employed to connectdistant organs, and often serve to determinethe direction and extent of their relative motions.With a view of ascertaining the actual strength of membranes,Scarpa stretched a portion of peritoneum, (which is a very-thinmembrane lining the abdominal cavity), over a hoop, andplacing weights upon its surface, found it did not give way till itwas loaded with fifteen pounds.102 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.They furnish strong coverings for the investment,the support, and the protection of all theimportant organs of the body. What Paleyhas termed the package of the organs is effectedprincipally by their intervention. Membranesare also employed to line the interior of all thelarge cavities of the body, as those of the chest,and of the abdomen, or lower part of the trunkcontaining the organs of digestion. These membranes,after lining the sides of their respectivecavities, are reflected back upon the organswhich are enclosed in those cavities, so as tofurnish them with an external covering. Theirinner sides present every where a smooth andpolished surface, over which the organs containedin the cavity may glide without injury.In all these cases, a thin fluid, called serum,is provided, which moistens and lubricates thesurfaces that are in contact with one another,and obviates the injury that would otherwisearise from friction. From this circumstance,the linings of these cavities have been termedserous membranes. In the neighbourhood ofjoints, closed cavities of the same description,but of smaller size, are met with, for the obviouspurpose of facilitating motion ; and here alsofriction is prevented by a highly lubricating fluid,termed synovia, which is poured out between thesurfaces of the membrane lining the cavities.Membranes, being impermeable to fluids, areANIMAL ORGANIZATION.extensively employed as receptacles for retainingthem : forming, in the first place, sacs, orpouches of various kinds for that purpose. Theink-bag of the cuttle fish, the gall-bladder, andeven the stomach itself, are examples of thiskind of structure. The coats of these sacs,being very extensible and elastic, readily accommodatethemselves to the variable bulk oftheir contents.In the second place, we find membranescomposing tubes of various descriptions for conductingfluids. Thus, in the higher classes ofanimals, the whole of the body is traversed byinnumerable canals conveying different kindsof fluids. These canals, when uniting intotrunks, or subdividing into branches, are calledVessels (Fig. 26).The fluids contained in vessels are neverstagnant, but are almost always carried forwardsin one constant direction. For preventing theretrograde motions of the fluids passing alongthese canals, recourse is had to the beautiful contrivanceof valves. The inner membrane of the104 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTION.vessel is employed to construct these valves ; forwhich purpose it is extended into a fold havingthe shape of a crescent ; fixed by its convexedge to the sides of the vessel, while the otheredge floats loosely in its cavity. Whenever thefluid is impelled in a direction contrary to itsproper course, it raises the loose edge of thevalve, which, being applied to the opposite sideof the canal, effectually closes the passage. Onthe contrary, it presents no obstacle to the naturalflow of the contents of the vessel, bothedges being then closely applied to the sameside. Frequently two, or even three valves areused at the same part, their edges being madeto meet in the middle of the passage, like thefloodgates, or locks of a canal.* Among thenumberless instances of express contrivancewhich are met with in the examination of thefabric of animals, there is perhaps none morestriking and more palpable, than this admirablemechanism of the valves.As we ascend from the simpler to the morecomplicated systems of organization, adaptedto a greater range of faculties, we find greaterdiversity in the mechanical means employedFig. 27, representing the section of a vessel, is intended toshow the position of the valves when applied to the sides of thevessel, by the stream moving onwards in the direction pointed outbythe arrow. In Fig. 28, they are seen closing the passageby the retrograde pressure of the current.ANIMAL ORGANIZATION, 105for carrying on the functions of life. Texturesof greater strength than can be constructed bymembranes alone become necessary for thesecurity, the support, and the defence of importantorgans ; and more especially for theexecution of extensive movements. For obtainingthese advantages a peculiar species offibres is provided, formed of a much densersubstance than even the most consolidatedforms of cellular texture. The animal producttermed albumen possesses a much strongercohesive power than gelatin, which is the basisof membrane. The addition of albumen, therefore,procures the quality required : and thefibres that are produced by its combinationwith gelatin are opaque, and of a glisteningwhite colour. By interlacing fibres thus composed,a close texture is formed, which is exceedinglytough and unyielding. These fibroustextures, as they are termed, while they retainthe flexibility of membranes, greatly surpassthem in strength ; but, being at the same timeincapable of extension, they are necessarily devoidof elasticity. Hence they are adapted toform external tunics for the investment of suchorgans as are not intended to vary in their size.Occasionally these fibrous capsules, as they arecalled, send down processes into the interior ofthose organs, for the purpose of giving themmechanical support. This is the case, for THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.stance, with the membranes surrounding thebrain of quadrupeds, and which form two partitions,the one vertical, the other horizontal ;both being firmly stretched in their respectivepositions, and serving to divide the pressure. Inother cases these sheets of fibrous membraneare employed as bandages, tightly bracing themuscles, and retaining them in their relativesituations. The joints are surrounded by similarbandages, known by the name of Capsular Ligaments.In following the series of animal structures inthe order of their increasing density, we find theproportion of albumen which enters into theircomposition becoming greater, while that of thegelatin and mucilage diminishes. When theproduct is more uniform in its composition it isin general less elastic than when it consists of amore complex combination of ingredients. Agreat preponderance of albumen tends also todiminish the elasticity. Thus the densest kindsof fibrous texture present, instead of thin andbroad expansions of elastic membrane, the thickand elongated form of inextensible cords, constitutingthe ordinary Ligaments, and the Tendons.These structures resist with great powerany force calculated to extend them : a propertywhich of course excludes elasticity, but, whenunited with flexibility, implies great toughness.In a word, they possess all the qualities that canANIMAL ORGANIZATION. 107be desired in a rope. It will hardly be creditedhow great a force is required to stretch, or ratherrend asunder a ligament ; for it will not yield inany sensible degree until the force is increasedso enormously as at once to dissever the wholecontexture of its fibres. Nothing can be moreartificially contrived than the interweaving ofthe fibres of ligaments ; for they are not only disposed,as in a rope, in bundles placed side byside, and apparently parallel to each other : but,on careful examination, they are found to be tiedtogether by oblique fibres curiously interlaced,in a way that no art can imitate. It is only afterlong maceration in water, that this complicatedand beautiful structure can be unravelled.The mechanical properties of these fibrousstructures, which are strictly inextensible ligatures,render them applicable to purposes ofconnexion where motion is to be restrained.Many cases, however, occur in which a substanceis wanted, uniting great compactness andstrength with a considerable degree of elasticpower. For this purpose a different texture isfabricated, consisting of twisted fibres, whichimpart this required elasticity. Such is thestructure of the elastic ligaments of animals,which are very generally employed for thesupport of heavy parts that require beingsuspended. An instance occurs in quadrupeds,in that strong ligament which passes along the108 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.back and neck to be fixed to the head, and tosupport its weight when the animal stoops tograze. This, the ligamentum nuchce, as it istermed, is capable of great extension, and byits elasticity reacts with considerable force inrecovering its natural length, after it has beenstretched. This ligament is particularly strongin the Camel, whose neck is of great length.*Another example of an elastic ligament occursin that which connects the two shells of bivalvemollusca (as those of the oyster and muscle), andwhich keeps them open when the animal exertsno force to close them. The claws of the Lion,and other animals of the cat tribe, are retractedwithin their sheaths by means of two strongelastic ligaments. Structures of this kind areemployed very extensively in the fabric of insects.!Many birds are provided with strong elastic ligaments connectingthe vertebrae of the neck with those of the back ; ligamentsof the same kind are also employed for retaining the wingsclose to the body, where they are not used in flying: and asimilar provision is made in the wings of bats. The weight ofthe bulky organs of digestion in herbivorous quadrupeds requiresome permanent support of this kind ; and this is furnished bya broad, elastic, fibrous band extended across the lower part ofthe abdomen. It is particularly strong in the elephant, whichremains more constantly in the horizontal position than mostquadrupeds : and it has been remarked that the general cellulartexture in this animal has an unusual degree of elasticity. —Hunter on the Blood, &c. p. 112.f Chabrier, Memoires du Musee, torn. vi. p. 416.ANIMAL ORGANIZATION. 109The animal substance which comes next inthe order of density is Cartilage. The purposesfor which this kind of structure is employed arethose in which a solid basis is required for thesupport of softer or more flexible parts, andwhere the mechanical properties that are wantedare firmness, conjoined with some degree ofelasticity. Cartilage (or gristle) is composed ofa finer and more uniform material than any ofthe preceding structures. It consists almostwholly of albumen, with a slight proportion ofcalcareous matter. Unlike membrane in anyof its forms, it contains no fibres, but, on beingcut with a sharp knife, presents the appearancesof a dense homogeneous substance of a whitepearly hue. Its surface is smooth, and whereit is exposed to friction, as in the joints, is oftenhighly polished.In all the inferior tribes of animals Natureemploys cartilage to supply the place of bonewhen rigidity is required to be given to thefabric. In an extensive order of fishes, includingthe shark, the sturgeon, and the ray,we find the whole skeleton constructed of cartilage.In the fabric of very young quadrupedscartilage is substituted for bone ; and in theadult animal, various organs, such as the externalears, the eye-lids, the nostrils, and differentparts of the apparatus of the throat and windpipe,are composed of flexible cartilage, which110 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.gives them a determinate shape and firmness.In all these cases bone, which, besides beingthree times as heavy, is devoid of elasticity, andliable to fracture, would have been much lesssuitable. Cartilage is often employed as anintermediate for connecting different bones, asfor instance, between the ribs and the sternum,or breast-bone ; whereby, besides the advantageof greater lightness, the pliancy of the materialdiminishes those jars which are incident to theframe in all its violent actions.In the construction of cartilage, nature seemsto have attained the utmost degree of densitywhich could be given to an internal texturecomposed merely of the usual animal constituents.But substances of still greater hardness,united with perfect rigidity, are wanted,in numberless instances, for giving effectualprotection to soft and delicate structures, forsupplying a firm basis to the framework of thebody, and for constructing levers of various kindsto be employed in the more energetic movementsof the higher animals. For all these purposesit was necessary to superadd a materialendowed with stronger cohesive powers, andcapable by its dense concretion of forming solidand inflexible organs. The substances whichnature has selected for this office are the salts oflime. Sometimes the Carbonate, and sometimesANIMAL ORGANIZATION. 1 1 1the Phosphate of lime is employed for formingthese hard and unyielding structures ; and oftenboth these calcareous substances are united togetherin different proportions in the same solidfabric. When the carbonate of lime predominates,or is the sole earthy ingredient, it constitutesShell : when there is a greater proportion ofthe phosphate, it is called a Crust, as is thecase with the coverings of the lobster and thecrab : when the earthy matter consists almostwholly of phosphate of lime, it composes the differentforms of Bone. I shall have occasion todescribe the formation and properties of each ofthese structures in the sequel.The protection of the delicate structure of thefabric from the injurious influence of externalagents is an object of great importance in theanimal economy, and is one which nature hasshown extreme solicitude to secure. For thispurpose she has provided the integuments, underwhich designation are included not merely theskin, but also all the parts that are immediatelyconnected with it, and are formed and nourishedby the same vessels. No parts of the animalstructure present greater diversity in their formand outward appearance than the integuments ;yet it is easy to discover, amidst all these varieties,that the same general plan has been followedin their construction, and that each partiTHE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.titular formation is the result of a combinationof the same elementary structures. Of theseelements the most important, and that whichgenerally composes the chief bulk of the skin,is the Corium, or true skin. The outermost layeris termed the Epidermis, Cuticle, or scarf-skin;and between these there is often found an intermediatelayer denominated the Rete Mucous,or the Pigments.The corium is generally of considerable thickness,and is composed of strong and tough fibres,closely compacted together, and pervaded byinnumerable ramifications of blood-vessels ofevery kind. It is endowed with great flexibility,and is capable of being considerably extended ;properties which fit it for readily accommodatingitself to all the movements of the body andlimbs, and to the variable bulk of the parts itcovers. Being also very elastic, it soon regainsits natural form and dimensions when left toitself after being stretched. The skin is connectedwith the subjacent muscles and otherparts by a large quantity of cellular texture,which, according to the particular intentions ofits formation, sometimes binds it tightly overthese parts, and on other occasions allows of afree and extensive motion. This latter propertyis remarkably exemplified in the Racoon, ananimal in which the skin hangs loosely on thelimbs, and encloses the body like a wide elasticANIMAL ORGANIZATION. 113garment ; so that, however firmly a person mayattempt to grasp the animal by the neck, it caneasily turn its head completely round, and bite thefingers that are holding it. In like manner theskin of the frog is attached to the body only at afew places, and may be readily stripped off. Athin layer of muscular fibres is often found lyingimmediately underneath the skin, and is providedfor the purpose of moving it over the subjacentparts. In animals that roll themselves into aball, as the hedge-hog, these muscles are ofgreat size and importance. We shall see thatin the mollusca, this muscular apparatus is inseparablyblended with the integument, and composesa peculiar structure, termed the mantle.Immediately covering the corium is the ReteMucous, which is a very thin layer of softanimal matter, composed of a net-work of delicatefibres, and containing more or less of the materialfrom which the colour of the skin is derived,The Epidermis is a membrane of a verypeculiar nature, consisting of a thin expansion ofalbuminous matter, apparently homogeneous inits texture and composition. It is impervious tofluids, although capable of imbibing moisture,and of slowly transmitting a portion to the subjacenttextures. Its thickness varies exceedinglyin different parts ; being adapted to the kind ofprotection it has to afford against pressure,friction, or other causes of injury. As it is notvol. i. I1 N THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.nourished by vessels, its outer layer is liable towear away, or to become, by drying, unfit foruse : and accordingly a separation of this outwardlayer generally takes place from time totime, the loss being speedily repaired by a freshgrowth from the surface in contact with the skin.This process is often performed periodically, asis most remarkably exemplified in serpents.Special provisions are made for preservingthe cuticle in a healthy condition ; and moreparticularly for defending it from the injuriousaction of the surrounding element. These sometimesconsist of a supply of oily fluid, preparedin small cavities that are situated in the skinitself, and have minute ducts opening upon thesurface. These cavities, termed sebaceous follicles,are generally interspersed in great numbers ondifferent parts of the body, abounding moreespecially in those places where folds occur, andwhere there is the greatest friction. In fishes,mollusca, and other aquatic animals, the skin isat all times defended from the action of thewater by a viscid or glutinous secretion, preparedin this manner, and continually pouredout on the surface, through ducts, the orifices ofwhich are easily seen with the naked eye, disposedin a line on each side of the body.Connected with the skin, and more particularlywith the cuticle, are structures of very variousforms, intended for giving additional protection,occasionally contributing their aid inANIMAL ORGANIZATION . 115progressive motion, and sometimes fashionedinto weapons of offence. In this class should beincluded all the varieties of hair, such as wool,fur, feathers, bristles, quills, and spines, as wellas the more ordinary kinds of hair. All theseresemble the cuticle in their chemical composition,differing only in their degrees of hardnessand condensation. Horn is formed of the samematerial as hair ; as are also the nails, the hoofs,and the claws of quadrupeds, and the scales offishes, reptiles, and other animals. The integumentsof insects, and especially their more solidand horny coverings, contain, however, as willhereafter be noticed, a peculiar chemical principletermed Entomology.All these parts seem to be but remotely connectedwith the vital actions of the system withwhich they are associated; and it is doubtfulhow far they are to be considered as appertainingto the living portion of the body, or asmere extraneous appendages. Yet, however theymay differ in their forms, uses, and external appearance,they all are produced by the samekind of vascular structure, variously arranged tosuit the particular circumstances in each case :and the mode of their development and growthis essentially the same in all.An extremely delicate and finely organizedpulp, composed partly of a congeries of minutevessels, and partly of a gelatinous substance, inwhich these vessels are embedded, constitutesTHE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.the apparatus by which the nutrient particlesare selected, combined and elaborated into thematerials of the intended structure. The originalform, situation, and disposition of this vascularpulp, determines the future figure and extent ofgrowth of the production which is to arise fromit. The materials which compose it are depositedsometimes in masses, as in the scales ofthe crocodile ; more generally in layers, as inhoofs and nails, and also in the scales of fishes ;*and occasionally in filaments, as in hair ; whichlatter, again, are often agglutinated together bya strong cement, uniting them into a hardand solid structure, of which the horn of therhinoceros is a remarkable example. In allcases, the portions thus successively produced,The laminated structure of the scales of fishes is easily distinguishedby applying to them a high magnifying power. Asthe breadth of each new layer is greater than the last, its edgesproject further, the whole surface having that concentric striatedappearance which renders it an interesting object for microscopicexamination. Fig. 29 exhibits the striated surface of the scale ofthe Cyprinus albertus, and Fig. 30 that of the P era fluriatilis .The imbricated arrangement of these scales, resembling that ofthe tiles on the roof of a house, is shown in Fig. 31. All thesefigures represent the objects highly magnified.ANIMAL ORGANIZATION.are no longer susceptible of being nourished,and from the moment of their deposition, undergono further change, except from the actionof external agents. By the continual additionsthat are made to them at their base, or root,where the vessels deposit fresh materials, theygradually increase in size, protrude through theskin, and continue to grow by the same process,as long as these vessels continue in activity.The nature of this process is well exemplifiedin the growth of hair. Fig. 32 shows the apparatusemployed in its construction, in an imaginarysection of the root, on a magnified scale.Every hair takes its rise from a minute vascularpulp, p, of an oval shape, which is implantedbelow the corium, or true skin, d.* This pulp isinvested by a sheathor capsule, c, which,together with the containedpulp, and theroot of the hair thatgrows from it, composesthe bulb of thehair. The bulb itselfis contained in a smallcell formed by condensedmembranes, s,to which it has no• In the above figure e is a section of the Epidermis, or cuticle ;the dotted part, r, represents the situation of the subjacent retemucous, and d, the term, or corium.1 IB THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.attachment excepting at the lower part, v, wherethe vessels and nerves of the pulp are passinginto it. The hair, growing by depositions fromthe inside of the capsule, which forms the outerpart, o, of the shaft, and from the outside of thepulp, which forms the inner or central part, i, isforced upwards till it has pierced the skin ; andin the course of its passage a canal is formed forit in the skin itself, and continuous with thatwhich encloses the bulb : and the course of thiscanal is generally oblique. In the elephant,where the thickness and density of the hide,present considerable obstacles to the passageof the hairs through it, we may discover, onminute examination, many hairs that have onlypenetrated a certain way, as shown at b, withoutever succeeding in reaching the surface.An opinion has been very commonly entertainedthat each hair, on its protruding fromunderneath the cuticle, e, at the point q, carriesup along with it a portion of this outer integument,which, stretching as the hair increases inlength, forms over it a very fine external tunic.But later observations have shown that this isnot the case, and that there is simply an adhesionof the edge of the cuticle to the origin ofthe hair, without any accompanying prolongation; so that if the whole bulb be destroyed, andits pulp absorbed, the hair may be detached bythe slightest force.ANIMAL ORGANIZATION. 119From this account it will be seen that a hair is,in its origin, tubular ; the inner part being occupiedby the pulp. But as the pulp extends onlyto that portion of the hair which is in a state ofgrowth, it never rises above the surface of theskin ; and the cavity in the axis of the hair iseither gradually obliterated, or is filled with adry pith, or light spongy substance, probablycontaining air. After a certain period, the bulbdiminishes in size, from the collapse of thevessels, whose powers of supplying, nutrimentbecome exhausted. The first deficiency in itsnourishment appears in the cessation of thedeposit of colouring matter, and the hair in consequencebecomes grey. After a time, thevessels becoming quite impervious, the bulbshrivels, the hair is detached, and the canalwhich its root occupied in the skin becomesobliterated.The hair of different animals, and even of differentparts of the same animal, is very variousin its shape, texture, and mechanical properties.Sometimes, instead of being cylindrical, the filamentsare more or less flattened, striated, deeplygrooved, or even beaded. Instead of beingsolid, they may even be tubular : and they exhibitalso the greatest diversity in their length,fineness, tenacity, rigidity, and disposition tocurl. All these varieties may be traced to correspondingdifferences in the form, and the relayTHE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.time actions of the component parts of the bulb,namely, the pulp and its capsule.*The structure of the organs by which hairsare formed is not easily distinguished, in theordinary kinds of hair, on account of theirminuteness: it is readily seen, however, in thelarge whiskers of the feline species, and also ofthe seal, which are subservient to more extendeduses than those of merely covering the body,and which are even supplied with nerves, convertingthem into instruments of a sense oftouch.In the quills of the porcupine a still morecomplicated organization has been detected.Fig. 33 shows a quill with its bulbous root, detachedfrom the body ; and Fig. 34, a transversesection magnified. The bulb itself is containedin a distinct cell, shown at a, Fig. 35, whichrepresents a longitudinal section of these organs.This cell contains a portion of fat in which thenumerous vessels supplying its pulp and capsuleare embedded. The bulb is itself surroundedby an outer sheath, s, into the cavity of which,b, there opens a duct, d, proceeding from a smallcell or follicle, f, lodged in the cellular substanceon the outside of the sheath. This upper cellcommunicates below with another cavity, c,See F. Cuvier's Memoir on the Formation of the Quillsof the Porcupine, in the Nouvelles Annales du Museum, I. 429.ANIMAL ORGANIZATION.containing an unctuous matter. During theformation of the quill this unctuous matter issupplied through this channel, and probablyenters as an ingredient in its composition. Thecapsule of the pulp consists of two membranes,the one enveloping the other. Fig. 36 showsthe bulb laid open by dividing the membranesand turning them aside. The horny portionof the quill is secreted by the internal membrane,i, and deposited in successive laminae.The external membrane is seen at o. Thepulp itself, seen at p, is still more curiouslyorganized ; its surface being fluted, or formedinto longitudinal processes. The horny matter,being deposited on these processes, is mouldedto their shape, and concretes into laminae whichconverge from the circumference of the cylindertowards the centre. The section (Fig. 36)122 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.shows these converging laminae, which beingof a dark colour, give to the surface of thequill the appearance of being grooved ; this,however, is merely an optical illusion, occasionedby the dark laminae being seen through thetransparent exterior covering ; as may readily bedetected by viewing the surface with a magnifyingglass.* After a certain period of the growthof the quill, the pulp ceases to supply the materialsfor forming the spongy substance whichoccupies the interior of the quill. But althoughit no longer secretes, it still retains its place ;and the capsule continuing to deposit horn, thequill becomes a hollow tube of considerablediameter. When it has attained a certain size,the pulp begins to shrink, and the diameter ofthe tube diminishes ; so that it exhibits a taperingform at both ends. Thus mere variations inthe bulk and the action of the pulp, accompaniedwith changes in that of the capsule, are sufficientto account for every diversity in the form andcondition of the resulting structures.Among the mechanical uses of the integument,that of serving as a cushion for relieving themore prominent parts of the frame, and especiallyof the bones, from unequal pressure, oughtIt is observed by F. Cuvier, that this striated appearance ispeculiar to the quills of porcupines of the old world. Those fromAmerica have no such arrangement of laminae.ANIMAL ORGANIZATION. 123not to be overlooked. This object is promotedby the interposition of a layer of fat, which isanother animal substance entitled to be enumeratedamong the elements of its structure. Itconsists of an oily fluid, composed, according tothe analysis of Chevreuil, of two constituentprinciples, which he has distinguished by theterms stearine and elaine. In warm bloodedanimals the temperature of the body is alwayssufficient to preserve this compound substancein a fluid form : but it is prevented from beingdiffused through the cellular texture by beingcontained in separate vesicles of extreme minuteness.*Hence the whole mass of the fat, whichis thus formed of an aggregation of thesevesicles, has not the appearance of being fluid,but seems to be composed of small grains unitedby membranous investments into larger masses ;a structure peculiarly adapted to the purposes ofa soft cushion, retaining only a small share ofelasticity, and yielding only in a certain limiteddegree to pressure.Dr. Monro estimated their diameter at between the soothand cloth of an inch. But their size varies in differentanimals.124 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.§ 5. Muscular Power.In Machines contrived by human skill the chiefart consists in devising expedients for regulatingand directing the given moving power, so thatit may bear, in the proper degree, and in theproper order, upon some particular objects, andproduce some particular effect. The whole ofthe apparatus employed with this intention, howevernumerous may be its parts, however variousthe forms of its wheels, its levers, or its pulleys,and however complicated may be their connexions,resolves itself into a series of intermediateinstruments for the transference of motionfrom the source of power, or the point where itsaction is impressed, to the parts which are designedultimately to receive the action of theforce employed. It is an established principlein physics, that mere machinery is incapable ofgenerating mechanical force; and that suchforce must always be originally derived fromsome extraneous source. Some impulse fromwithout, whether it be the pressure of the wind,the fall of a stream of water, or the action ofmen or horses, or any other kind of foreignagency, must be resorted to, both to set theengine in motion, and to continue its movementswhen they are once begun. Nor is theMUSCULAR POWER. 125case essentially different when the source ofmotion apparently resides in some internal partof the machine itself; in a watch, for instance,which is actuated by the main spring ; or in asteam engine, which is set in motion by theelastic vapour contained in its cylinder : thespring in the one case, and the vapour in theother, although they may in one sense be regardedas impelling powers, are, in reality, butintermediate agents in the distribution of aforce originating from other sources. In thewatch, the force may be traced to the handwhich coiled the spring : in the steam-engine,to the fire, which has imparted elasticity tothe vapour.The living body differs from inorganic machineryin containing within itself a principleof motion not referable, as far as we can perceive,to any of the primary forces which existin the inanimate world. This principle hasbeen termed contractility. In animals of thesimplest construction, every part of the substanceof the body seems to be equally endowedwith this contractile property, although exhibitingno distinct appearance of a fibrousstructure. This is the case with all the lowerzoophytes, such as the Infusoria, Polypi, Medusa,and the simpler kinds of Entozoa.Among the Polypi and Infusoria we meetwith a singular mode of acting upon the THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.rounding fluid by means of very minute andgenerally microscopic filaments, which the animal,by some unknown power, causes to vibratewith great rapidity. Occasionally these organsare found even in animals belonging to thehigher classes. Wherever they are met withthey perform, as will hereafter be shown, veryimportant functions ; sometimes assisting in respiration,at other times contributing to thesupply of food, and very generally serving asinstruments of progressive motion.In animals placed a little higher in thescale, we begin to trace the formation of fibres,which at first are irregularly scattered throughthe soft substance : but as the organization becomesmore refined, these fibres are collectedinto bundles, and compose what are properlycalled muscles. Muscular fibres are attached attheir extremities to the parts intended to bemoved. In the lower animals these attachmentsare principally to the skin, or otherexternal parts, which are subservient to thepurposes of progressive motion. In the higherclasses, the solid parts, or skeleton, being disposedmore in the centre of the system, themuscles are applied to them in the interior ofthe body, and are more distinctly separatedinto masses, each having its proper function inthe movements of the frame.The peculiar property which characterisesMUSCULAR POWER. 127the muscular fibre is that of suddenly shorteningitself, so as to bring its two ends, and the partsto which those ends are connected, nearer toone another. This contraction is performedwith astonishing quickness and force, and theaccumulated effect of a large collection of thesefibres, such as constitutes a muscle, is thereforecapable of overcoming great resistances, orof raising enormous weights. Those muscles,which, by means of their nerves, as will hereafterbe noticed, are subservient to voluntarymotion, are excited into action by an exertionof the will of the animal. There are, however, agreat number of other muscles, the contractionsof which are involuntary, that is, are producedby other causes than the will.*Muscular contractility, of which there existsno trace in the vegetable kingdom, f has beenestablished by nature as the primary movingpower of the animal machine. This agent isThese two classes of muscles do not differ in their outwardappearance : but Dr. Hodgkin has lately pointed out a curiousdifference in the microscopic structure of the fibres of some ofthe involuntary muscles. See Appendix to his Translation ofEdwards on the influence of Physical Agents in Life, p. 443.f The principal instances, which have been adduced insupport of the opinion that muscularity occasionally exists invegetable structures, are the alternate movements of the leafletsof the Hedysarum gyrans, which have been fancifully comparedto the movements of the ribs in respiration ; the quickmotions of the stamina of the Berberis, Opuntia, and manyplants of the genera Cards, and Centaurea ; the closing of the128 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.resorted to on all occasions where considerablemechanical force is wanted ; just as in a greatmanufactory, where an immense quantity ofmachinery is to be set in motion, and a greatvariety of work is to be executed, the humanmechanist avails himself of some constantmoving force, such as that of water, or steam.The laws of inorganic matter furnish no powerthat could conveniently have been applied inthe animal body for that purpose ; but muscularpower, from its high intensity, is adequate toevery object, and has been accurately adjusted,by the most refined application of thelaws of mechanism, to all the degrees and kindsof effects intended to be produced.Although the power be the same, yet themode of its application is exceedingly diversified; and the comparison of these diversitiesis the more interesting, inasmuch as there arefew of the animal functions in which the endsto be answered are so definite, and the operationof the expedients employed is so plain andintelligible. For while the intricate chemicalleaves of the Dioces muscipula; and the shrinking of thoseof the Mimosa utica, or sensitive plant. On a superficialview, it must be acknowledged that these motions bear a resemblanceto the effects of muscular contractility ; but I believethat naturalists are now generally agreed that there is no realanalogy between these phenomena, and that there is no substantialevidence for the existence of that property in the vegetablekingdom.MUSCULAR POWER.processes of the living system generally eludeour research, and the higher faculties of sensationand perception are dependent on still morerecondite and mysterious powers of nature, themechanical functions are effected by the simplerproperties of matter, and allow us a clearerinsight into the wonderful art which has beenexerted in their accomplishment.Muscles, during their contraction, increase inthickness in the same proportion as they diminishin length.* It is on this account, more38 43uIamFv^Sk#;£/*/'■' 'especially, that a knowledge of anatomy is sonecessary to the painter and the sculptor. Inevery movement and attitude of the body,some particular sets of muscles are in action,This is illustrated by the annexed figures, 37 and 38, theformer showing the relaxed and elongated, and the latter thecontracted and swollen state of the same muscle.VOL. I. K130 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.and consequently tense and prominent, whileothers are relaxed and flattened ; differenceswhich it is requisite that the artist shouldfaithfully express, in order to give a correctrepresentation of the living figure.The dilatation of the muscular fibres in thickness,which accompanies their contraction inlength, would, if these fibres had been looseand unconnected, have occasioned too great aseparation and displacement, and have impededtheir co-operation in one common effect.Nature has guarded against this evil by collectinga certain number of the elementaryfibrils, and tying them together with threads ofcellular substance ; thus forming them into alarger fibre ; and again packing a number ofthese fibres into larger bundles : always surroundingeach packet with a web of cellulartissue ; which thus forms a separate investmentfor each. This plan of successive reunion intolarger and larger assemblages is carried onthrough several gradations of size, till the entiremuscle is completed.That we may be the better able to appreciatethe excellence of the plans adopted in the mechanismof the animal frame, let us inquire whatarrangements would occur to us, prior to an acquaintancewith those actually adopted, as themost advantageous dispositions of the muscularpower. It is evident, that the simplest modeMUSCULAR POWER. 131would be that of extending the fibres of themuscle in a straight line between the points intendedto be brought nearer to each other. Thisdirect application of the power, however, isseldom compatible with convenience, unless theparts to be moved are of very small size, andrequire very delicate adjustments. Straightmuscles, accordingly, are employed chiefly forthe movements of the minuter parts of the apparatusbelonging to the senses, such as theeye, and the ear, and also that of the voice.In insects, when the hard case, or skeleton, iswholly external, this direct application of themoving force is also very generally employed.The shells of the bivalve mollusca, as of theOyster and the Cardium, are closed by one ortwo straight muscles, the fibres of which passimmediately from the inner surface of the oneto that of the other.In the greater number of cases it is more convenientto place the muscle in a situation whichcauses it to act obliquely with respect to thedirection of the motion produced in the part towhich it is attached. This will, of course, be attendedwith a loss of force corresponding to thedegree of obliquity ; but there are, at the sametime, advantages gained, both in point ofvelocity of motion, and also in the effect beingproduced by a smaller extent of contraction inthe fibres of the muscle. Oblique muscles are132 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.frequently employed in pairs, and are made toact on opposite sides of the line of the intendedmotion, which is, in this case, the diagonal betweenthe direction of the two equal forces.Thus, in order to bring a bone at p, Fig. 39,down to the point q, the two muscles a andb, extending from the fixed points m and n,may be employed ; for as they exert forces inthe directions p m and p n, there will resulta force in the intermediate direction p o : andthe effect desired will be accomplished morequickly, and with a smaller extent of contractionin the muscles producing it, than if thesame power had been applied by means of astraight muscle in the direction p o.* It is bymeans of two sets of muscles, acting thus obliquely,that the ribs are brought in closer approximationevery time that the chest is elevatedin breathing. Thus carefully does naturedispose the muscular fibres so as to obviatethe necessity of their being contracted beyonda certain extent : and thus does she economize,as much as possible, the expenditure of muscularpower, wherever there is a constant call forits exertion.The principle which I have just explained,whereby certain advantages result from the ob-seea paper by Dr. Monro, in the Transactions of the RoyalSociety of Edinburgh. Vol. iii. p. 250.MUSCULAR POWER. 133equity of the action of muscular fibres, is applied,not only to the entire muscle, but also tothe internal arrangement of its fibres. Thus, wegenerally find that, in a flat muscle, its upperand under surfaces are covered by a thin sheet offibrous texture, or thin expansion of ligament ortendon ; and that the muscular fibres which areattached to them are directed obliquely from theone to the other, in the manner represented bythe section, Fig. 40. There is frequently amiddle tendinous layer interposed between thosethat are on the surface (as shown in Fig. 41), inWhich case the muscular fibres pass obliquelyfrom the former to the latter, but in different directionson each side ; like the fibres proceedingfrom the shaft of a pen. A muscle thus constructedhas accordingly been termed a penni-formmuscle; as is exemplified in the straightmuscle inserted into the knee-pan (the rectusextensor cruris), and also in the muscle whichbends the great toe (the flexor policies pedislongus). The arrangement first described, Fig.40, forms the semi-penniform muscle ; an instanceof which occurs in the muscle of the leg, whichis termed the semimembranosus. Frequently thestructure is rendered still more complex, bythe interposition of several tendinous layersamong the fleshy fibres. This arrangement,which constitutes a complex muscle, (as shown inFig. 42) occurs, for example, in the Socius, or134 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.large muscle, which raises the heel, and formsthe thickest part of the calf of the leg.It very commonly happens in the animalframe, as it does in other machines, that thepresence of the moving agent in the spot whereits action is wanted, would be exceedingly inconvenient.The usual plan adopted for transferringthe effect of the moving power to adistant point is the employment of a rope, orstrap. Such is precisely the office of the tendons,which are long straps, attached at one endto the muscle, and at the other to the bone,or other part intended to be moved. (See Fig.43). If the hand, for instance, had been encumberedwith all the muscles which are necessaryfor the movements of the fingers, it nevercould have performed its office as a delicatemechanical instrument. These muscles, accordingly,are disposed high up on the arm, andtheir tendons are made to pass along the wrist tothe joints of the fingers which are to be moved.The employment of tendons is accompaniedwith this farther advantage, that by their interventionthe united power of all the fibres of themuscle may be obtained, and concentrated uponany particular point. In this respect, likewise,they resemble a rope, at which a great numberof men are pulling at the same moment, andwhose combined strength is thus brought intoaction. Another principal use of tendons isMUSCULAR POWER. 135that a different direction may, by their means,be given to the moving power, without alteringits position. Many instances occur of theirapplication in this manner, by their being madeto pass round corners of bones, and alonggrooves, or channels, expressly formed for theirtransmission, and producing the effect of pullies.In a great number of muscles, the fibres,instead of running parallel to one another, aremade either to converge, or to diverge, in orderto suit particular kinds of movements : and wefrequently find that different portions of thesame muscle have the power of contractingindependently of the rest, so as to be capable ofproducing very various effects, according as theyact separately or in combination. This is exemplifiedin the muscle of the back, called theTrapezius, represented in Fig. 44. In manyinstances, the fibres radiate in all directionsfrom a common centre : this is the case withthe delicate muscle of the ear-drum, as shown inFig. 45. In that of the elephant, which is aboutan inch and a half in diameter, these radiatingfibres are very conspicuous, even to the nakedeye : and they are also visible in the membraneof the human ear, when viewed with a goodmicroscope.*At other times, the muscular fibres run in a• Home Phil. Trans, for 1800, p. 1.THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.circular direction, forming what is called anorbicular r or sphincter muscle, of which an exampleoccurs in that which surrounds and closes theeye. (Fig. 46.) Very frequently these two lastmodes of arrangement are united in some part,as appears to be the case in the membrane ofthe eye, called the Iris. (Fig. 47.) The circularfibres of the iris surround the central aperture,or pupil, the size of which they diminish whenthey contract ; while on the contrary, the radiatingfibres, acting on the inner circle, anddrawing it nearer to the outer circumference,which is fixed, lessen the breadth of the ring,and consequently enlarge the circular aperture.A similar combination of radiating and circularfibres is employed in the construction offlat, or slightly concave muscular disks, whichare thus rendered capable of exerting a strongforce of adhesion to the surfaces on which theyare applied. In these organs the circular fibresare placed at the circumference, and the radiatingfibres in the interior of the sucker, (seeFig. 48) ; so that, while the margin of the diskis closely applied to the object, the force result-muscularPOWER. 137ing from the contraction of the circular fibresis exerted to remove the central portions fromthe surface of attachment, and thereby tendsto create a vacuum underneath the disk ; thetwo surfaces remain, therefore, strongly attachedby the atmospheric pressure, which acts on theirouter sides. An apparatus of this kind, as weshall afterwards find, is met with very frequentlyamong the lower orders of the animal kingdom.Another kind of circular disposition of fibresis that which occurs in the muscular coats surroundingcanals of various kinds, such as theblood vessels and the alimentary tube. Theiraction tends to contract the diameter of thecanal, and to exert pressure on its contents. Inthese cases, there is generally at the same timeprovided another layer of fibres, disposed longitudinally,as shown in Fig. 49 ; the circular fibresbeing seen in Fig. 50. The action of the longitudinalfibres is evidently to shorten the canal ;while that of the circular fibres, by the yieldingand the partial reaction of the contents of thevessel, has a tendency to extend it. The Asciclia,138 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.which is a species of marine worm, is an exampleof an animal whose skin contains a union ofstraight and circular fibres, by which all itsmovements are readily performed. Many instancesoccur in the cylindrical envelopes ofanimals, of the combination of a third series offibres, passing obliquely, with those which havetransverse and longitudinal directions* In themuscular skin of the Leech, for example, besidestwo internal layers of longitudinal fibres, an externalone has lately been discovered, which iscomposed of oblique or spiral fibres, crossingone another in opposite directions, and greatlyfacilitating the varied movements of the animal.*A variety of still more complicated arrangementsmay be traced in the fibres of thosemuscles which invest hollow sacs, or receptacles,such as the stomach, (Fig. 51,) and the heart,(Fig. 52). We find, in the substance of theseorgans, sets of fibres, which pass in a spiraldirection, and which, consequently, unite theeffects of both longitudinal and circular fibres ;and, when combined with either of these, theyserve to modify, and regulate the actions of eachorgan in a great variety of ways.fCarus, Table Ant. Comp. fol. Tab. I. Fig. 6.f The muscular fibres of the heart are disposed in two layers ;each set passing in a spiral course from the basis, or broad part,to the point or apex ; but the direction of the turns being differentin each, the two layers cross or decussate, producing theMUSCULAR POWER. 139The infinite mechanical skill, with which themoving power has been applied to the purposesto be accomplished, is displayed not only in thelarger organs, where great force is to be exerted,but also, in a still more conspicuous manner, inthe execution of the smaller motions, requiringthe most accurate regulation, and the nicestadjustments. We cannot but be struck with theaccordance which may often, in these instances,be traced with human contrivances, when thegreater motions are rapidly executed by one setof agents, acting with considerable power andvelocity, while the minuter approximations tothe exact positions are effected by a distinct partof the apparatus, capable of more delicate action,though with a smaller force. Thus, while theastronomer brings his telescope round by powerfulmachinery, so as to direct it to that part ofthe heavens, where the object he wishes to viewis situated, a more nice mechanism is employedto direct the instrument accurately to the exactpoint ; and again another is provided for makingthe proper focal adjustments. Many parallelcases occur in the mechanism of the animalframe ; one set of powerful muscles being em-effectand procuring the advantages of a combination of obliquemuscles already explained. Thus beautifully is the arrangementof the muscular fibres of the heart calculated to produce therapid and complete expulsion of its contained blood, with thesmallest amount of contraction in the individual fibres.140 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.played for the larger movements, and another setprovided for the accurate regulation of the moredelicate inflexions and nicer positions. This weshall find exemplified in the movements of thefingers, and of many of the organs of the finersenses.In general, however, we may observe that themechanical expedients devised by Nature foreffecting each particular purpose are characterisedby the most admirable simplicity. Inthis respect, also, as well as in all others, wecannot fail to recognise their infinite superiorityover every corresponding invention of man.In human works, though laboured on with pain,A thousand movements scarce one purpose gain ;In God's, one single can its ends produce,Yet serves to second too some other use." Pope.We may generally observe, in the mechanismof the joints, that the muscles are made to act,,either directly or by means of their tendons, at apoint much nearer to the axis of motion thanthe resistance to be overcome. With regard tothe direct force, therefore, it is evident thatthey must act with a great mechanical disadvantage; and this disadvantage is still fartherincreased by the obliquity of the action with referenceto the direction of the motion. But thecontractile power, which is inherent in the muscularfibre, is so enormous, as amply to affordMUSCULAR POWER. 141these losses, great as they necessarily are ; while,on the other hand, full compensation is madeby the greater freedom and velocity of motionthereby obtained. Strength is sacrificed withoutscruple to beauty of form or convenience ofpurpose ; and that disposition of the force, isalways adopted, from which, on the whole, thegreatest practical benefit results. Every wheredo we find the wisest adaptation of muscularpower to the objects proposed, whether it beexerted in laborious efforts of the limbs andtrunk ; whether employed in balancing theframe, or urging it into quick progression ; orwhether it be applied to direct the delicate evolutionsof the fingers, the rapid movements of theorgans of speech, or the more exquisite adjustmentsof the eye, or of the internal ear. Amidstthe endless combinations of machinery exhibitedin different parts of the animal kingdom,although the mode of application be diversifiedin ten thousand ways, the original power is stillof the same kind, and is regulated by the samephysical laws ; and similar instruments are employedin effecting this infinite variety of purposes,by the all wise and omnipotent Architectof animated creation.Chapter II.THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS IN ZOOPHYTES.§ 1 . General Observations.The mechanism of an organized being isdesigned to fulfil various important objects.These we may distinguish into two classes ; theone having reference to its internal welfare, theother to its relations with external bodies. Thedifferent parts of its system must, in the firstplace, be mechanically united and supported, aswell as protected from injurious external impressions; and they must at the same time be soconstructed as to admit of all the internal movements,which the performance of their functionsrenders necessary. They must, in the secondplace, be made capable of exerting upon externalmatter the actions which conduce to theirwell being ; and in order to enlarge their sphereof action, they must have the power of transferringthe whole body from one place to another ;or, in other words, of effecting its progressivemotion.The objects included in the first of theseZOOPHYTES. 143branches of the mechanical functions are answeredby the organization both of the vegetableand the animal systems : but those of the latterbelong exclusively to the functions of animallife. The power of locomotion, more especially,constitutes the most general and palpable featureof distinction between these two classes ofbeings. A plant, during the whole period of itsexistence, is fixed to the spot where it was firstproduced, and is dependent for the continuanceof its life on local circumstances ; such as thenature of the soil in which its roots are embedded,and the qualities of the air and water in itsimmediate vicinity. It is exposed to the actionof the surrounding elements, and affected bytheir vicissitudes, without the means of retreat,and without the power of reaction. With respectto all external agents, indeed, vegetables mayberegarded as passive beings. Very differentare the condition and destination of animals.Excepting a few among the lower orders of thecreation, such as Zoophytes and Mollusca, allanimals are gifted with the power of spontaneouslychanging their situation, according totheir several wants and necessities, and are thusenabled to seek and to choose those objectswhich are salutary, and to avoid or reject thosewhich are injurious. Nature has, for thesepurposes, furnished them with a more complex144 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.organization and more varied powers, adapted toa greater diversity of pursuits, and to a higherand more expanded sphere of existence.The power of progressive motion is enjoyed invery different degrees by different races of animals,according to the particular model onwhich they are constructed, and the relationswhich their organization bears to the elementassigned as their residence. All the mechanicalcircumstances in their economy, indeed, are soclosely linked together, as scarcely to admit ofbeing considered separately. Thus we find, inone animal, a variety of mechanical effects accomplishedby one and the same instrument;while, in others, they are each produced by aseparate and distinct organ. In some, the leadingprinciple of the construction is simplicity ;in others, the most elaborate mechanism is displayed.But the means have constant referenceto the design, and are ever varied in exactconformity with the change of purpose. Therelative advantages of each plan of structureappear to have been carefully estimated, andstudiously balanced. Each quality has beenbestowed in different degrees of perfection ; sothat in following the series of gradation amongthe successive tribes of animals, we occasionallymeet with favoured species, endowed withgreat superiority in some particular faculty.Some animals excel in swiftness; others inZOOPHYTES. 145strength. Some are qualified to dive into therecesses of the deep ; others to flutter in thelight regions of air ; while, in many of the inferiorranks, we find all these objects renouncedfor the more certain advantage of security,which the softer texture of the organs rendersone of paramount importance. That constructionof limbs which favours certain movementswill necessarily interfere with the ready performanceof others, and must preclude the developmentof the organs which would be necessaryfor facilitating them. Different kinds ofprey require dexterity in particular actions fortheir pursuit and seizure. The animal is, inone case, formed for climbing trees ; in another,for burrowing in the earth : in a third, for perforatingwood. Some are provided with organsfor penetrating into the bodies of other animals ;others with the means of ensnaring their captives ;while others, again, instil into the veins of theirvictims a deadly poison. Hence it is necessary,in studying the organization of animals, tobestow particular attention on the habits andmode of life for which each respective tribe andspecies has been destined.In the examination of the mechanical functionswhich will form the first part of thistreatise, I shall keep in view, as the leadingobject of inquiry, the faculty of progressivemotion, noticing its different degrees of per-vol.I. l146 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.section as we follow the ascending series ofanimals ; but adverting, also, occasionally, tothe other topics which belong to this class offunctions.It may be observed in general, that the mechanicalconstruction of animals which constantlyinhabit a watery element is more simplethan the construction of those which live onland, and are encompassed by a lighter medium.Differing but little in their specific gravity fromthe fluid in which they are immersed, aquaticanimals are necessarily supported, on all sides,by a powerful hydrostatic pressure, which nearlybalances the force of gravity, and counteracts thetendency of their bodies to descend in the fluid.Many of the obstacles to progressive motion arethus removed ; and there is no necessity for thecompactness of frame, and the rigidity and cohesionof substance which are required in terrestrialanimals.The animals that occupy the lower divisionsof the scale can exist only in a liquid element.Their forms present many analogies with vegetables; and hence they have been denominatedZoophytes, that is, animated plants : but as it isnow well ascertained that they possess the essentialcharacters of animals, the term of Phytozoa,or plant-like animals, which has been given tothem by some modern writers, would appear tobe a more appropriate designation. It is, how-sponges.147ever, scarcely worth while, at the present day,to change a name so generally received as thatof Zoophytes, and the application of which isnot likely to lead to any misunderstanding.§ 2. P or if era, or Sponges.Among Zoophytes, the lowest station in thescale of organization is occupied by the tribes ofPorter, the name given by Dr. Grant to theanimals which form the various species of sponge,and which are met with in such multitudes onevery rocky coast of the ocean, from the shoresof Greenland to those of Australia. Spongesgrow to a larger size within the tropics, and arefound to be more diminutive, and of a firmertexture, as we approach the Polar circles. Dr.Grant observes* that they are met with equallyin places covered perpetually by the sea, as inthose which are left dry at every recess of thetide. They adhere to, and spread over the surfaceof rocks and marine animals, to which theyare so firmly attached that they cannot be removedwithout lacerating and injuring theirbodies. " Although they thrive best," he fartherremarks, " in the sheltered cavities of rocks,they come to maturity in situations exposed toEdinburgh Philosophical Journal, vol. xiii. p. 94.148 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.the unbroken fury of the surge. They cover thenakedness of cliffs and boulders ; they line witha variegated and downy fleece the walls of submarinecaves, or hang in living stalactites fromthe roof."In their general appearance they resemblemany kinds of plants, but in their internal organizationthey differ entirely from every vegetableproduction ; being composed of a soft flesh,intermixed with a tissue of fibres, some of whichare solid, others tubular ; and the whole beinginterwoven together into a curious and complicatednet-work. The substance of which thissolid portion, or basis, is formed, is composedpartly of horn, and partly of siliceous or calcareousmatter. It has been termed the axis of the Zoophyte; and as it supports the softer substanceof the animal, it may be regarded as performingthe office of a skeleton, giving form and protectionto the entire fabric.The material of which the fleshy portion iscomposed is of so tender and gelatinous a naturethat the slightest pressure is sufficient to tear itasunder, and allow the fluid parts to escape ; andthe whole soon melts away into a thin oilyliquid. When examined with the microscopethe soft flesh is seen to contain a great numberof minute grains, disseminated through a transparentbelly. Every part of the surface of aliving sponge (as may be seen in Fig. 53) responses.149sent to the eye two kinds of orifices ; the largerhaving a rounded shape, and generally raisedmargins, which form projecting papillae ; thesmaller being much more numerous, and exceedinglyminute, and constituting what aretermed the pores of the sponge.It has, for a long time, been the receivedopinion among naturalists that this superficiallayer of gelatinous substance was endowed witha considerable power of contractility : it wasgenerally believed that it shrunk from the touch,and that visible tremulous motions could be excitedin it by punctures with sharp instruments,or other modes of irritation. It is extraordinarythat errors like these should have crept into thewritings of modern zoologists of the highestauthority, such as Lamarck, Bruguiere, Gmelin,Bos, and Lamouroux.* The notion that theThis mistaken view was adopted by Cuvier in the first editionof his " Regni Animal," T. iv. p. 88. ; but Dr. Grant's rectificationof the error is noticed in the second edition of that work. —T. hi. p. 322.150 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.sponge contracts when touched is of very ancientdate, for it may even be traced beyond the timeof Aristotle ; and it has been handed down bysucceeding naturalists, and echoed from the oneto the other, so as to have gained admission,without being questioned, in all the recent systematicworks on Zoology.The alleged spontaneous palpitation of theflesh, occurring in particular parts, had its originin the views taken of the nature of sponges byMarsigli, an Italian naturalist, who, in the year1771, announced that he had seen movements ofdilatation and contraction in the round aperturesvisible on the surface of sponges. This statement,so confidently advanced, seems to havemade a strong impression on Ellis, who, whilepursuing a similar train of observations, came topersuade himself that he could see, not only themovements described by Marsigli, but also thepassage of water to and fro, through the sameapertures. He communicated this account tothe Royal Society in 1765 ; it was publishedin its Transactions,* and will ever remain aninstructive proof of the degree in which our veryperceptions may be influenced by preconceivedviews, and by the force of the imagination.Pallas immediately admitted, without examination,the hasty assertion of Ellis, into his " Elen-Vol. lv. p. 284.SPONGES. 151chus Zoophytorum ;" whence it was copied bysucceeding authors, and the error became atlength so widely disseminated, that for morethan half a century it was received as an establishedfact in natural history. The elaborateand accurate researches of Dr. Grant on thesesubjects have at length dispelled the prevailingillusion, and have clearly proved that the spongedoes not possess, in any sensible degree, thatpower of contraction which had, for so manyages, been ascribed to it.*Dr. Grant has also shown the true nature ofthe currents of fluid issuing at different pointsfrom the surface of these animals, as well as theabsence of all visible movements in the orificeswhich give exit to the fluid. Never did he find,in his experiments, the slightest appearance ofcontraction produced in any part of the sponge,by puncturing, lacerating, burning, or otherwiseinjuring its texture, or by the application ofcorrosive chemical agents. Of his discovery ofthe fluid currents, he gives the following interestingaccount : "I put a small branch of theSponge capita, with some sea-water, into awatch-glass, under the microscope, and, on reflectingthe light of a candle through the fluid,See his papers on this subject in the Edinburgh PhilosophicalJournal, vol. xiii. p. 95 and 333, from which most of the factsmentioned in the above account are taken.152 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.I soon perceived that there was some intestinemotion in the opaque particles floating throughthe water. On moving the watch-glass, so as tobring one of the apertures on the side of thesponge fully into view, I beheld, for the firsttime, the splendid spectacle of this living fountain,vomiting forth, from a circular cavity, animpetuous torrent of liquid matter, and hurlingalong, in rapid succession, opaque masses, whichit strewed everywhere around. The beauty andnovelty of such a scene in the animal kingdom,long arrested my attention, but after twenty-fiveminutes of constant observation, I was obligedto withdraw my eye from fatigue, without havingseen the torrent for one instant change its direction,or diminish, in the slightest degree, therapidity of its course. I continued to watch thesame orifice, at short intervals, for five hours,sometimes observing it for a quarter of an hourat a time, but still the stream rolled on with aconstant and equal velocity." About the end ofthis time, however, the current became languid,and, in the course of another hour, it ceasedentirely. Similar currents were afterwards observedby Dr. Grant in a great variety of species.They take place only from those parts that areunder water, and immediately cease when thesame parts are uncovered, or when the animaldies.It thus appears that the round apertures inSPONGES. 153the surface of a living sponge are destined forthe discharge of a constant stream of water fromthe interior of the body ; carrying away particles,which separate from the sides of thecanals, and which are not only seen, under themicroscope, constantly issuing from these orifices,but may even be perceived by the naked eye,propelled occasionally in larger masses.*For the supply of these constant streams, it isevident that a large quantity of water must becontinually received into the body of the sponge.It is by the myriads of minute pores, which existin every part of the surface, that this waterenters, conveying with it the materials necessaryfor the subsistence of the animal. These poresconduct the fluid into the interior, where, afterpercolating through the numerous channels ofcommunication which pervade the substance ofthe body, it is collected into wider passages,terminating in the fecal orifices above described,and is finally discharged. The mechanism bywhich these currents are produced is involvedin much obscurity. There can be no doubtthat they are occasioned by some internal movements; and the analogy of other zoophytesThe currents issuing from the larger orifices are best seenby placing the living animal in a shallow vessel of sea water,and strewing a little powdered chalk on the surface, the motionsof which will render the currents very sensible to the eye. Fig.53 exhibits these phenomena.154 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.would lead us to ascribe them to the action offibrils, or cilia, as they are termed, projectingfrom the sides of the canals through which thestreams pass ; but these cilia have hithertoeluded observation, even with the highest powersof the microscope.The organization of sponges is as regular anddeterminate as that of any other animal structure,and presents as systematic an arrangementof parts. In some species, such as the commonsponge, the basis is horny and elastic, and composedof cylindric tubes, which open into eachother, and thus form continuous canals throughoutthe whole mass.Others have a kind of skeleton, composed ofa tissue of needle-shaped crystals of carbonateof lime, or of silex. These hard and sharp-pointedfibres, or suicide, are disposed aroundthe internal canals of the sponge, in the orderbest calculated to defend them from compression,and from the entrance of foreign bodies. Someof these spicula are delineated in Fig. 54 : buttheir forms, although constant in each species,admit of considerable diversity in the differentkinds of sponge.Although sponges, in common with the greaternumber of zoophytes, are permanently attachedto rocks, and other solid bodies in the ocean,and are consequently destined to an existenceSPONGES. 155as completely stationary as that of plants, yetsuch is not the condition of the earlier, and moretransitory stages of their development. Nature,ever solicitous to provide for the multiplicationof each race of beings, and for their disseminationover the habitable globe, has always providedeffectual means for the accomplishment ofthese important ends. The seeds of plants areeither scattered in the immediate neighbourhoodof the parent, and take root in the adjacent soil,or are carried to more distant situations by thewind or other agents. In the animal kingdom,the young offspring of those races which are endowedwith a wide range of activity, are rearedon the spot where they were produced, either bythe fostering care of the parent, or by means ofthe nourishment with which they are surroundedin the egg, and there remain until the periodwhen, by the acquisition or extension of locomotivepowers, they are enabled, in their turn, togo in quest of food. But in the tribes of animalsat present under our consideration, thisorder is reversed. It is the parent that ischained to the same spot from an early periodof its growth, and it is on the young that theactive powers of locomotion have been conferred,apparently for the sole purpose of seeking foritself a proper habitation at some distance fromthe place of its birth; and when once it has156 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.made this selection, it there fixes itself unalterablyfor the remaining term of its existence.*The parts of the Sponge panacea, which arenaturally transparent, contain at certain seasonsa multitude of opaque yellow spots, visible tothe naked eye, and which, when examined bymeans of a microscope, are found to consist ofgroups of ova, or more properly gemmules,^ sincewe cannot discover that they are furnished withany envelope. In the course of a few monthsthese gemmules enlarge in size, each assumingan oval or pear-like shape, and are then seenprojecting from the sides of the internal canalsof the parent, to which they adhere by theirnarrow extremities. In process of time, theybecome detached, one after the other, and areswept along by the currents of fluid, which arerapidly passing out of the larger orifices. Fig.55 represents one of these gemmules detachedPhenomena, which appear to bear some analogy with these,have been noticed in the vegetable kingdom. The tribe of Zoo-carpi,produce a kind of fruit, which when detached from theparent, appears to possess powers of spontaneous motion, untilthe period of its taking root, and growing like a vegetable structure.These singular productions, which seem, in their progressivedevelopements, to possess alternately the characters ofvegetables and of animals, may perhaps be regarded as connectinglinks between the two great kingdoms of living nature.f Gemmule is a term derived from the Latin word gemma, abud : and its meaning, as applied to zoophytes, is that of ayoung animal, not contained within an envelope, or egg.SPONGES. 157from the parent sponge. When thus set atliberty, they do not sink by their gravity to thebottom of the water, as would have happenedhad they been devoid of life ; but they continueto swim, by their own spontaneous motions, fortwo or three days after their separation from theparent. In their progression through the fluidthey are observed always to carry their roundedbroad extremity forwards. On examining thispart with the microscope, we find that it iscovered with short filaments, or cilia, which arein constant and rapid vibration. These ciliaare spread over about two thirds of the surfaceof the body, leaving the narrower portion, whichhas a whiter and more pellucid appearance, uncovered.They are very minute transparentfilaments, broadest at their base, and taperingto invisible points at their extremities: theystrike the water by a rapid succession of inflexions,apparently made without any regularorder, but conspiring to give an impulse in aparticular direction. When the body is attachedby its tail, or narrow end, to some fixed object,the motion of the cilia on the fore part of the bodydetermines a current of fluid to pass in a directionbackwards, or towards the tail; but whenthey are floating in the water, the same actionpropels them forwards in the opposite direction,that is, with the broad ciliated extremity foresTHE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.most. They thus advance, without appearing tohave any definite object, by a slow glidingmotion, totally unlike the zig-zag course of animalculesin search of prey. Yet they appear tohave a consciousness of impressions made onthem ; for on striking against each other, ormeeting any obstacle, they retard a little themotion of their cilia, wheel for a few secondsround the spot, and then, renewing the vibrations,proceed in their former course.In about two or three days after these gemmuleshave quitted the body of the parent, theyare observed to fix themselves on the sides orbottom of the vessel in which they are contained ;and some of them are found spread out, like athin circular membrane, on the surface of thewater. In the former case, they adhere firmlyby their narrow extremity, which is seen graduallyto expand itself laterally, so as to form abroad base of attachment. While this is goingon, the cilia are still kept in rapid motion onthe upper part, scattering the opaque particles,which may happen to be in the fluid, to a certaindistance around. But these motions soonbecome languid, and, in the course of a few hours,cease; and the cilia, being no longer wanted,disappear. The gemmule then presents theappearance of a flattened disk, containing granules,like the flesh of the parent sponge ; andSPONGES. 159also several spicula interspersed through thecentral part. In less than twenty-four hours,a transparent colourless margin has extendedround the whole gemmule, and continues tosurround it during its future growth. The spicula,which were at first small, confined to thecentral part, and not exceeding twenty in number,now become much larger and more numerous; and some of them shoot into the thin homogeneousmargin. It is a remarkable circumstancethat the spicula make their appearancecompletely formed, as if by a sudden act ofcrystallization, and never afterwards increasetheir dimensions.When two gemmules, in the course of theirspreading on the surface of a watch-glass, comeinto contact with each other, their clear marginsunite without the least interruption ; they thickenand produce spicula : in a few days we candetect no line of distinction between them, andthey continue to grow as one animal. The samething happens, according to the observation ofCaroline, to adult sponges, which, on cominginto mutual contact, grow together and form aninseparable union. In this species of animalgrafting we again find an analogy between theconstitution of zoophytes and that of plants.In the course of a few weeks, the spiculaare assembled in groups, similar to those of100 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.the parent sponge ; assuming circular arrangements,and presenting distinct openings at thepoints they enclose. The young animal nowrapidly spreads and enlarges in every direction,becoming more convex, and at the same timemore opaque, and more compact in its texture ;and before it has attained the tenth of an inchin diameter, it presents, through the microscope,a miniature representation of its parent.Thus has a power of spontaneous. motion beengiven to what may be regarded as the embryocondition of animals, which are afterwards soremarkable for their inertness, and for the privationof all active powers : and this has been conferredevidently for the purpose of their beingwidely disseminated over the globe. Had not thisapparatus of moving cilia been provided to thegemmules of such species as hang verticallyfrom the roofs of caves, they would have sunkto the bottom of the water and been crushedor buried among the moving sand, instead ofsupporting themselves while carried to a distanceby the waves and tides of the ocean.Many species which abound in the Red Seaand Indian Ocean have, in this way, beengradually transported, by the Gulf stream, fromthe shores of the east to corresponding latitudesof the new world.POLYPI. 161§ 3. Polypi/era.The next step in the organic series introducesus to the extensive family of Polypifera. Thetransition from the structure of the sponge to thatof the polypus may be thus conceived. Supposethe absorbing orifices of the former to be enlarged,and their number to be at the same time reduced: and let these orifices be drawn out intotubes, and provided with vibratory cilia; inaddition to which, let there be placed aroundtheir margin a circular row of larger filaments,extremely flexible, and capable of twininground any object that comes within their reach,and of conveying it to the central orifice,which performs the office of a mouth. Eachtube, thus furnished with a circle of radiatingfilaments, or tentacula, as they are called, isdenominated a Polype* The animal structurethus composed has received the name of £0-bulgaria (Fig. 56), and is the genus among thistribe that approaches the nearest in its characterto the sponge, which it resembles in theFor the sake of greater distinctness I shall employ the termpolype to denote the single tube with its tentacula ; and shalldesignate by the Latin term polypus the entire animal mass composedof an aggregation of these polypes. Polypifera, the nameof the order, expresses animals bearing polypes.VOL. I. MTHE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.nature of its internal texture. Each of thepolypes with which its surface is studded haseight serrated tentacula. Fig. 57 represents oneof these polypes detached. Polypes may thus beunited in immense numbers in one mass, havingmutual organic connexion. In other cases theymay form smaller clusters, or be even totallyunconnected. Sometimes the detached polypesare still disposed to assemble in-groups, as is thecase with the Zoanthus of Cuvier* (Fig. 58): atother times they are altogether isolated, as inthe Hydra viridis (Fig. 59).Polypi form a very extensive order of zoophytes,abounding in every part of the ocean,but growing in greatest luxuriance in theThe Hydra sociata of Gmelin; the Actinia sociata ofEllis.POLYPI. 163warmer regions of the globe. Their flesh exhibitsthe same granular appearance as that ofthe sponge, but it is generally firmer, and oftenintermingled with masses of calcareous matter.The tentacula, which may be compared to arms,vary in number and in length in different speciesof polypi, and sometimes, instead of a singlerow, each of the mouths has two or more seriesof tentacula placed around it. They are formedof a prolongation of the soft substance of thepolypus, and are sometimes tubular; and theircavities are then continuous with that of thegeneral internal cavity into which the severalmouths open. Besides being flexible in everydirection, the tentacula are also capable of beinglengthened or shortened at the pleasure of theanimal. Their elongation is produced by thepropulsion of a fluid into their interior, derivedfrom the general cavity of the body; and theirretraction is effected by the return of the samefluid.The whole arrangement of the tentacula onthe margin of the projecting mouths bears astriking resemblance to a flower, especially tothose which, like the daisy, or china-aster, havethe corolla composed of slender radiating petals.We find, indeed, that as the organs of zoophytesbecome more developed, the affinities which theselower departments of the animal kingdom retainwith plants, are more marked and more predo-104 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.dominant. In the construction of zoophytes, natureseems still to keep in view the models of vegetableforms, the characters of which, whileeffecting the transition from one kingdom tothe other, she continues to impress on her productions.Zoophytes, both in their outwardform, and in the disposition of their internalorgans, preserve the symmetrical arrangementround a common centre so generally exhibitedin plants, and especially in flowers, and in theverticillated leaves and branches.* Hence theradiated or star-like forms which predominate inmostof the animals composing this class : andhence they have obtained the title of Radiata,by which Cuvier has designated them.Like the animals of the sponge tribe, Polypiare for the most part attached to some inorganicshell or base, which may be either of a horny orcalcareous nature. The form of this shell admitsof almost infinite variety. In some it constitutesthe external surface of the animal, and enclosesthe flesh in a general sheath, leaving onlyopenings at the extremities of the tubes for theexpansion of each set of tentacula surroundingthe respective mouths. Sometimes these tubesare placed parallel to each other, like the pipesof an organ, with transverse partitions at regularintervals : such is the structure of the TubiporaSee page 90.POLYPI.musica, as shown in Fig. 61. In Fig. 62, aportion of the tubes is seenhighly magnified, and laidopen, to show the polypes intheir interior. At other timesthe tubes are joined togetherendwise, like the branches ofa tree, leaving lateral aperturesfor the protrusion of thetentacula of each separatepolype : this is the case in the Sertularia.(Fig. 60.)In some species the horny base is fashionedinto a number of cells, each of which serves forthe protection of its respective polype. Thesecells are generally placed at the extremity ofthe branches, presenting the greatest similitudeto flowers. The F lustra (Fig. 63) is composedof minute and almost microscopic cells, spreadover a flat membraneous substance, resembling,in the flexibility of its texture, and its mode ofsubdivision, the leaves of plants. These cells arearranged in rows, with great regularity, like thoseTHE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.of a honey-comb, as is seen in the magnifiedview of them, Fig. 64.In other tribes the inorganic base of supportis internal, constituting a kind of skeleton oraxis; the polypous mouths being spread at intervalsover the surface of the fleshy layer whichcovers this skeleton. This is the case with theGorgonia, Antipathies, and the Coral, which exhibitstill closer resemblances to the branchedforms of vegetable stems. The flesh containsgranules of calcareous matter, which, in thedried specimens, adhere to the surface of thestems. Fig. 65 is a branch of the Corallinerubrum, of which Fig. 66 is a magnified portion,showing the appearance of the polypes in theirexpanded and contracted states. The way inwhich the polypes are embedded in the flesh isseen in Fig. 67, which represents a section of theGorgonia Briar eus.In many cases the polypes are lodged in cup-likedepressions in the surface of the calcareousaxis, which affords them some degree ofprotection. In Madrepores these depressionsPOLYPI. 167are crossed by radiating plates, adapted to theform and number of the tentacula. In Mille-poresthe cells are closer and more minute, andexhibit none of these star-like radiations. Insome species the plates have more of a parallelarrangement ; and in others they form a network.The material of which this axis, to which thepolypes are attached, is composed, is of variouskinds. Sometimes it is horny, flexible, andelastic, corresponding in its nature *to animalmembrane : at other times it is hard and calcareous,being composed principally of carbonateof lime, with a small quantity of the phosphate ;the proportion of this latter ingredient varyingin different species. In all cases the particlesof calcareous matter are united together by someportion of animal substance which may be obtainedby dissolving out the former by an acid.We always find the materials arranged in concentriclayers, indicating that their depositionhas been successive ; and the surface is markedby longitudinal lines, corresponding to the figureof the animal covering of flesh. Sometimes thestem consists of horny and calcareous parts disposedalternately, composing a jointed structure,which some have fancied might be consideredas making an approach to an articulated skeleton; for it is capable of considerable flexion,and readily yields to the impulse of the waves,168 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.without the risk of being broken. This is thecase with the Isis hippuris, commonly known bythe name of jointed coral. (Fig. 68.) There is,in short, hardly any possible combination of theseparts which does not occasionally occur amidstthe infinite diversities of condition displayed inthis department of the animal creation.These structures are generally attached tosubmarine rocks by an expansion of the baseinto a kind of foot, or root, which has a strongpower of adhesion. In this respect, therefore, asin so many others, these animals preserve ananalogy with plants.It has been ascertained that, in a great numberof instances, these fixed zoophytes are multiplied,like the sponge, by the detachment ofgemmules, or imperfectly formed portions oftheir soft substance. These gemmules requireto undergo the same kind of metamorphosis inorder to bring them to their perfect state; andwhen newly detached from the parent, they exhibitthe same singular spontaneous motions,buoying themselves in the water, and swimmingin various directions, by the rapid vibrations oftheir cilia, till they find a place favourable totheir growth. On becoming fixed, they spreadout to form a base for the future superstructure ;and, after the foundation has thus been laid,they proceed in their upward growth, depositinga calcareous or horny axis in successive layers,POLYPI. 169until it has acquired the requisite thickness ;and they then gradually assume the forms characteristicof the particular species to whichthey belong. The materials thus deposited arepermanent structures, not capable of modificationor removal, and not possessing any vital properties; for these properties belong exclusivelyto the animated flesh with which these structuresare associated. The polypes themselves are notdeveloped till after the formation of the root andstem ; their growth being in this respect analogousto that of the leaves and flowers of a plant.The gemmules of the Flustra carbasea maybeselected in illustration of these phenomena.These have been observed by Dr. Grant,* to swimabout in the water as soon as they have escapedfrom the cells of the parent ; each moving withits narrow end foremost, while the opposite broadend, which is covered with cilia, expands into aflat circular zone. These gemmules are veryirritable, and are frequently seen to contract thecircular margin of their broad extremity ; and,while swimming, to stop suddenly in their course.They swim with a gentle gliding motion, atother times they appear stationary, all the whilerevolving rapidly round their longer axis, withtheir broad end uppermost : they often boundforwards, either in straight lines, or describingEdinburgh Philosophical Journal, XVII. 107 and 337.170 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.circles, with no other apparent object than tokeep themselves afloat, until they shall arrive ata favourable spot for fixing their permanentabode, and proceeding in their further development.The time of their remaining in this freeand moving state varies according to circumstances,from a few hours to about three days.When about to fix, the slightest agitation of thewater causes them to desist, and to recommencetheir gliding motions, which they continue forsome time longer. If, when any of these gemmuleshas begun to fix, it be again disturbed,and separated from the surface to which it hadbecome attached, it generally remains free, andperishes. During the process of fixing, it exhibitsno peculiar appearance or change of form ;it simply lies on its side ; and the cilia continueto vibrate over the whole surface, producing aconstant current in the water, apparently for thepurpose of cleaning the space immediately surroundingthe gem mule. It remains for threedays in this attitude, without undergoing anyperceptible change of form, and without relaxingthe vibrations of its cilia. At the end of thistime, the cilia cease to move, and shortly afterdisappear: then the gemmule begins to swell,the surrounding margin becomes more transparent,and the whole gradually assumes theform of a cell, surrounded by a delicate whiteopaque line, which is the rudiment of the calca-POLYPI. Vitreouswall of the future cell. Towards the baseof this rudimental cell, the gelatinous substancein the interior may be perceived to become moreconsistent and opaque at a particular point ;from this dull spot within the cell, short straighttentacula begin to bud, extending upwards inthe direction of the future aperture. The gelatinousspot, from which the tentacula originated,assumes the vermiform appearance of the bodyof a polype ; and we may distinctly perceivethe bundles of fibres which connect its head withthe base of the cell. The structure of the polypeis perfected by the addition of a closed capsule ;and when it is first detected protruding from thecell, it possesses all the parts of an adult polype,and vibrates the cilia of its tentacula with asmuch regularity and velocity as at any futureperiod. Before the polype is capable of protrudingfrom the aperture of the first cell, the upperpart of the cell has already extended outwardsto form the rudiment of a second : and so on, insuccession, till the whole structure is completed.The tentacula of polypi are exquisitely sensible,and are frequently seen, either singly oraltogether, bending their extremities towardsthe mouth, when any minute floating bodycomes in contact with them. When a polypeis expanded, a constant current of water isobserved to take place, directed towards themouth. These currents are never produced bythe motions of the tentacula themselves; but17.2THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.are invariably the effects of the rapid vibrationsof the cilia placed on the .In the polypes of theFlustra carbasea, (Fig. 69),the tentacnla have each asingle row of cilia, extendingalong both the lateral margins,from their base to their termination.*Each polype hasusually twenty-two tentacula ;and there are about fifty cilia on each side of atentacles, making 2200 cilia on each polype.As there are above 1800 cells in each squareinch of surface, and the branches of an ordinaryspecimen present about ten square inches of surface,we may estimate that an ordinary specimenof this zoophyte presents more than 18,000 polypes,396,000 tentacula, and 39,600,000 cilia.But other species certainly contain more thanten times these numbers. fThe vibrations of these cilia are far too rapidto be followed by the quickest eye, even whenassisted by the most powerful microscope, andcan be detected only at the times when theyhave become comparatively languid, by the diaportion of one of these tentacula is represented, highly magnified,in Fig. 70.

(Fig. 70.)All the cilia appear to commence and to ceasetheir motions at the same moment. The constancywith which they continue would seemto exclude the possibility of their being theresult of volition ; and they are, therefore, moreprobably determined by some unknown physicalcause, dependent, however, on the life ofthe animal. But so retentive are they of thepower of motion, whatever may be its cause,that if any one of the tentacula be cut off, itscilia will continue to vibrate, and will propelit forward in the fluid for a considerable time,as if it had become itself an individual animal.A question arises with regard to the constitutionof these zoophytes, similar to thatwhich has been proposed with regard to trees,namely, what limits should be assigned totheir individuality ? Is the whole mass, whichappears to grow from one root, and whichconsists of multitudes of branches, proceedingfrom a common stem, to be considered as oneindividual animal, or is it an assemblage oraggregation of smaller individuals: each individualbeing characterised by having a singlemouth, with its accompanying tentacula, andyet the whole being animated by a commonprinciple of life and growth ? The greater numberof naturalists have adopted this latter view,THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.regarding each portion, so provided with a distinctcircle of tentacula, as a separate animal,associated with its neighbours in the constructionof a common habitation, and contributing itsquota to the general nourishment of this animalrepublic. As the determination of this questioninvolves the consideration of the function ofnutrition, I shall postpone its further discussionto a future part of this treatise. As far, indeed,as regards the mechanical condition of animalswhich are so completely stationary, it matterslittle, whether the whole mass be regarded asone individual animal, or as an aggregate ofdistinct individuals. But the question becomesof some importance when applied to detachedzoophytes, such as Pennatula, which are formedof a multitude of polypes connected with a commonstem, but which float at liberty in the sea.The Pennatula (Fig. 71) has been termed thesea pen, from the circumstanceof its calcareous axis, or stem,having a double set of branches,extending in the same planefrom both the sides, like thevane of a quill, and of its seriesof polypes being set along oneedge of each branch, like thefilaments which arise from thefibres of the feather. Some ofthese polypes are seen magnified in Fig. 72.Immense numbers of these curious animals arePENNATULA. 175met with in different parts of the ocean. Ifthey possessed in any degree the power of locomotion,which many naturalists have ascribedto them, we should be able to ascertain whetherall their movements are conducted by a commonvolition, or whether they are performed independentlyof one another. It has often, indeed,been asserted, that pennatulse swim through thewater by their own spontaneous movements,consisting either in the waving up and down ofthe lateral branches, or in the simultaneous impulsesof the tentacula of all the polypes. Cuviereven represents the polypes of the pennatula ashaving the power of keeping time, while theyare waving the mass through the water, as ifthey were all actuated by a single undividedvolition. But Dr. Grant, who has watched themotions of these animals with great care, is ledby his observations to the conclusion that are not in reality possessed of any suchlocomotive faculty ; but that they are carriedto and fro in the ocean, like the gulf weed,without the slightest voluntary power of directingtheir course. Whatever may be the resultof the combined movements of the tentacula, thearms are certainly incapable of those inflexionswhich have been supposed to supply the meansof progressive motion.It is only when the contractile flesh of thepolypus is released from the restraint which176 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.the solid axis imposes upon its movements, thatthe animal becomes capable of any distinctpower of locomotion. Such is the conditionof the animals belonging to the genus Hydra,of which the Hydra viridis, or fresh waterpolype, (Fig. 59, p. 162) may be taken as thetype. This singular animal presents us withperhaps the simplest kind of structure that existsin the animal kingdom. It would almost seemas if Nature had formed it with the design ofexhibiting to us the resources of vitality in carryingon the functions of animal life without theaid of the complicated apparatus which she hasbestowed upon the higher orders of the creation.The Hydra consists merely of a fleshy tube,open at both ends, one of which, being moredilated, may be regarded as the head, and hasfor a mouth the aperture of the tube, which isfurnished at its margin with a single row of ten-macula.It thus corresponds to the general definitionof a polypus, and exemplifies its mostsimple form.The whole body may, on the one hand, beconsiderably elongated, and on the other, somuch retracted, as to appear a mere globule ;and these movements are the effect of a voluntarypower in the animal directed to specific ends.The number of tentacula varies from six totwelve ; they are slender tubular filaments, capableof being extended to a great length, andHYDRA. 177of being bent in all directions. In this way,they can quickly surround and grasp any smallobject which they may happen to touch ; andwhenever irritated they instantly retract, so ashardly to be visible without the aid of a magnifier.Each tentacles may be moved independentlyof the rest, at the pleasure of theanimal. The remainder of the body tapersgradually from the head to the other extremity,becoming very slender, and having at its terminationa flat surface, which has been termed thefoot; for although every portion of the surfacehas the power of adhering to the bodies to whichit is applied, it is principally by this extremitythat the animal chooses to attach itself to thesides or bottom of the vessel in which it is kept.No trace of the existence of cilia can be met withon any part of the surface of these animals.It is to Mr. Trembleyy of Geneva that we areindebted for the discovery of this singularanimal, the examination of which has contributedto throw great light on the natural historyof polypiferous animals.* While observing someaquatic plants, which he had collected andput into water, his attention was called to theappearance of filaments adhering to them,which he at first conceived to be parasitic vege-Memoires pour servir a histoire d'un genre de Polypesd'eau douce, a bras en forme de cornes. Par A. Trembleyy, 1744.VOL. I. N178 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.tables : but farther observation convinced himthat they were endowed with powers of spontaneousmotion, and that they preyed upon smallinsects : and he, therefore, could no longerdoubt their animal nature. He found that theyalways placed themselves on the side of theglass next to the light ; and by watching theirchanges of position, he discovered the mode inwhich they effect their progressive motions. Ifthe hydra be standing in the erect position, itsfoot being applied to the bottom of the glass(Fig. 73), it slowly bends the body in the directionin which it intends to advance till its headtouches the vessel, as shown in Fig. 74. It thenadheres to the surface by the mouth, or by oneor two of its tentacula, and, detaching the foot,bends the body into a curve, at the same timeslightly retracting it, so that the foot is broughtnear the head (Fig. 75). The foot is then againfixed, preparatory to a new step, which it takesby detaching the head and projecting it forwardsas before (Fig. 76).The progress made by these successive effortsis but slow : for the hydra often pauses in themidst of a step, as if deliberating whether itHydra. 179should proceed : so that the traversing a distanceof seven or eight inches is to these animals avery good day's journey, even in summer. Butamode of travelling rather more expeditiousthan this is occasionally resorted to. It consistsof a succession of somerset: the hydra,while adhering firmly by the mouth, detachesits foot, and, making it describe a semicircle,throws it over its head, and places itforemost in the line of progression. Havingattained this situation, the foot is then fixed,and a similar semi-revolution is performed bythe head, the body continuing all the whileelongated.By these and other manoeuvres these animalscontrive to walk with equal facility in anydirection, either on the bottom or sides of thevessel, or along the stems of aquatic plants, towhich they are most frequently found attached.The position in which they appear to take mostdelight, is that of remaining suspended from thesurface of the water by means of the foot alone :and this they effect in the following manner.When the flat surface of the foot is exposed forashort time to the air, above the surface of thewater, it becomes dry, and in this state exertsa repulsive action on the liquid : so that whendragged below the level of the surface by theweight of the body it still remains uncovered,and occupies the bottom of a cup-shaped hollow180 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.in the fluid, thereby receiving a degree of buoyancysufficient to suspend it at the surface. Theprinciple is the same as that by which a dryneedle is supported on water in the boat-likehollow which is formed by the cohesive force ofthe liquid, if care be taken to lay the needledown very gently on the surface. If, while thehydra is floating in this manner, suspended bythe extremity of the foot, a drop of water bemade to fall upon that part, so as to wet it, thishydrostatic power will be destroyed, and theanimal will immediately sink to the bottom.While in this state of suspension from thesurface, the hydra is capable of performingseveral curious evolutions, and with the assistanceof the tentacula, by which it lays hold ofobjects within its reach, is able to cross overfrom one side of the vessel to the other. It doesnot appear that these animals ever employ thetentacula as instruments for swimming ; but theyfrequently use them as cables, or anchors, toenable them to retain their positions in security,however violently the water may be agitated.Great use is also made of the tentacula as organsof prehension for seizing and detaining theirliving prey, and for conveying it to the mouth,where it is quickly swallowed. On the otherhand, when alarmed, or exposed to irritation,the hydra suddenly shrinks, by the gradualcontraction of all the tentacula, and of the bodyalso, into a small globule, which might easilyHYDRA. 181escape notice, unless its previous situation wereaccurately observed.It might be asked by what power is thisanimal, occupying so low a place in the scaleof organization, enabled to perform these actions?To this question, however, no satisfactoryanswer has yet been given. The substanceof the hydra, when examined by the microscope,appears to be nearly homogeneous, except that anumber of grains are intermixed with the pulpyand gelatinous matter composing the principalbulk of the body. These grains, when pressedout of the flesh into water, are scattered indiscriminately; and appear to have been unitedin the living animal, by means of this glutinousmaterial.No perceptible fibres, either muscular, or ofany other kind, can be detected in the flesh ofthe polypus : nor is there the least indicationof the formation of transverse rings, similar tothose which exist in worms, and which, in theselatter animals, contribute to progressive motion.Every portion of the substance of the body isequally irritable and contractile, and its movementsappear to be governed by some voluntarypower belonging to the animal, and directed tothe attainment of certain ends. The softnessand pliancy which it possesses allow of its beingclosely fitted to all the inequalities of the surfaceof the bodies to which it is applied ; andperhaps this cause alone occasions it to adhere182 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.with great force to these bodies, without the aidof any glutinous fluid. A conjecture, which hasmuch appearance of probability, has beenoffered, that this power of adhesion is derivedfrom the presence of a great number of exceedinglyminute disks, interspersed over everypart of the surface, constituting so manysuckers, and resembling, though on a verydiminutive scale, the sucking apparatus on thearms of the cuttle-fish.The Zoanthus (Fig. 58) belongs to a tribe oflarger polypi, which are generally met withassembled in clusters; on which account it istermed by Ellis the Actinia sociata, or cluster-animalflower. It consists of a globular body,having a mouth surrounded by one or two rowsof tentacula ; and connected below with a firmand fleshy tube, which adheres strongly to therocks at the bottom of the sea ; so that it remainspermanently fixed in the same place.The genus Vorticella is formed by a smalltribe of animals, which, although they havebeen usually included under the present order,differ from Polypi in having no tentacula, butonly cilia, surrounding the margin of a bell-shapedbody, which is mounted upon a longand slender foot-stalk (Fig. 77).* Currents are,They also differ from Polypi in having a distinct intestinalcanal, with numerous stomachs.INFUSORIA*as usual, excited by the vibrations of the cilia ;which in the simpler species, such as the77 Vorticella cynthia, here delineated,are the efficient instrumentsof progressive motion.When attached by itsfoot stalk, the vorticella advancesin search of food, bythe extension of the foot-stalkinto a straight line ; but quicklyretreats from danger, by suddenly throwingit into spiral folds. Many of the species ofvorticella are so exceedingly diminutive as tobe imperceptible without the aid of the microscope.They conduct us, therefore, by a naturalgradation, to the next order we have to notice,and which is composed wholly of microscopicanimals.§ 4. Infusoria.The Industry animalcules, or Infusoria, were sonamed by Muller, a Danish naturalist, from thecircumstance of their swarming in all infusionsof vegetable or animal substances that havebeen kept for a sufficient time. They are, ingeneral, far too minute to be perceptible to thenaked eye : it is to the microscope alone,therefore, that we owe our knowledge of their184 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.existence, and of the curious phenomena theypresent : yet even the best instruments afford usbut little insight into their real organization andphysical conditions. On this account it is extremelydifficult to assign their true place in thescale of animals. By most systematic writersthey have been regarded as occupying the verylowest rank in the series, and as exemplifyingthe simplest of all possible conditions to whichanimal life can be reduced. Monads, which arethe smallest of visible animalcules have beenspoken of as constituting " the ultimate term ofanimality;" and some writers have even expresseddoubts whether they really belong to theanimal kingdom, and whether they should notrather be considered as the elementary moleculesof organic beings, separated from each other bythe effects of chemical decomposition, and retainingthe power of spontaneous, but irregularand indeterminate motion. It was conceived thatall material particles belong to the one or theother of two classes ; the first, wholly inert andinsusceptible of being organized ; the second,endowed with a principle of organic aptitude, orcapability of uniting into living masses, and constituting,therefore, the essential elements of allorganization. According to this view, all vegetablesor animals in existence would be mereaggregations of industry animalcules, which graduallyaccumulate by continual additions toINFUSORIA. 185their numbers, derived from organic matterin the food : so that the body of man himselfwould be nothing more than a vast congregationof monads !This bold and fanciful hypothesis, devised byBufFon, and recommended by its seductive appearanceof simplicity, as well as by the glowingstyle and brilliant imagination of its author,has had many zealous partisans. The newworld, which was disclosed to the wonderingeyes of naturalists by the microscope, aboundingin objects and in phenomena of which no conceptioncould have been formed previously tothe invention of that instrument, was peculiarlycalculated to excite curiosity, and to inspire thehope of its revealing the secret of the living principlein the arrangement of the atoms of organicbodies. During the greater part of the last century,industry animalcules were the subject offrequent and laborious microscopical research,and gave rise to endless conjecture and speculationas to their origin, their vitality, and theirfunctions in the economy of nature. Notwithstandingtheir minuteness, considerable differencesof organization were perceived to existamong them : but many naturalists still clung tothe idea that monads, the most diminutive of thetribe, and whose very presence can be detectedonly by the application of the highest magnifyingpowers, are homogeneous globules of living186 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.matter, without organization, but endowed withthe single attribute of voluntary motion : andeven this property was denied to them by someauthors.All these fanciful dreams have been dispelledby the important discoveries of Ehrenberg, whohas recently found that even the Monas terms ispossessed of internal cavities for the receptionand the digestion of its food ; and who has renderedit probable that their organization isequally complex with that of the larger speciesof infusoria, such as the Rotifera, in which hehas succeeded in distinguishing traces of a muscular,a nervous, and even a vascular system.Those animalcules, whose form can be at alldistinguished, exhibit a great diversity of shapes,and variety of modes of progressive motion.Many, as the Cyclidium, have the appearance ofa thin oval pellicle, smoothly gliding in all directionsthrough the fluid : some, as the Volvox,are globular ; others, as the Cercaria, are shapedlike a pear, tapering at one end, and often terminatingin a slender tail, so as to resemble atadpole. In many, this tail is of great length ; insome, as the Furcocerca, it is forked ; in others,it takes spiral turns, like a corkscrew. TheVerona has processes like horns. The shape ofthe Vibrio is cylindrical, and more or lesspointed at one or both ends, like an eel, or aserpent, which animals it also resembles in itsINFUSORIA. 187adulatory mode of swimming.* Some, as theGonium, have an angular, others, as the Kol-soda, a waving outline. Some, as the Urceolaria,present the likeness of a bell or funnel, andappear to be analogous to the Vorticella, inwhich genus they should probably be included.Forms still more irregular are exhibited byother infusoria. Of these the most singular isthe Proteus (Fig. 78), which cannot, indeed, besaid to have any determinate shape, for it seldomremains the same for two minutes together. Itlooks like a mass of soft belly, highly irritableand contractile in every part ; at one time whollyshrunk into a ball, at another stretched out intoa lengthened ribbon ; and again, at anothermoment, perhaps, we find it doubled upon itselflike a leech. If we watch its motions for anytime,we see some parts shooting out, as if sud-animalculesreferable to this genus are met with in greatnumbers in blighted wheat, (Fig. 2, p. 62) in sour paste, andin vinegar which has lost the whole of its alcohol. In this lastfluid they sometimes attain so large a size as to be visible to thenaked eye.188 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.deny inflated, and branching forth into star-likeradiations, or assuming various grotesque shapes,while other parts will, in like manner, be asquickly contracted. Thus the whole figure may,in an instant, be completely changed, by metamorphosesas rapid as they are irregular andcapricious.The Volvox globator (Fig. 79) is found in prodigiousnumbers at the surface of many stagnantpools. Its figure is perfectly spherical ; and itsmovements consist in a continual and rapidrotation round its axis, frequently remaining allthe while in the same spot. Another species,the Volvox conflict, moves by turning alternatelyto the right and to the left.The progressive movements of industry animalculesare of two kinds, the one consisting inasmooth and equable gliding through the fluid,produced apparently by the vibrations of cilia,which are set on various parts of the body, andoften seem to cover the whole surface : the other,more rapid and energetic, when the animalculedarts forward in a particular direction, as if inpursuit of prey, and proceeds by sudden andirregular starts, like a vivacious insect or fish.The voluntary nature of their motions is evidentfrom the dexterity they display in avoiding obstacles,while swimming together in myriads inasingle drop.The great agent in the movements of theanimal frame being the muscular fibre, it wasWHEEL ANIMALCULES. 189natural to suppose that a texture analogous tothat of muscles might exist in these latter generaof infusoria. It was not till very recently, however,that the actual presence of contractile fibrescould be recognised. But this problem has atlength been solved by the discoveries of Ehren-berg, who, in his observations of the larger andmore highly organized species belonging to theorder of Rotifera, has, with a magnifying powerof 380, distinctly seen muscular bands runningin pairs between the two layers of transparentmembrane which envelope the body. When theanimalcule throws itself into its violent lateralcontortions, these fibrous bands are observed tobecome broader and thicker, as well as shorter,on the side towards which the contractions takeplace. There can, therefore, be no doubt thatthese are muscular organs, and that they are thereal agents by which the motions witnessed areeffected.These Rot if era, or wheel animalcules, are sonamed from their being providedwith an apparatus for creating aperpetual eddy, or circular currentin the surrounding fluid.'The remarkable organs, by whichthis effect is produced, are generallytwo in number, (Fig. 80, r, r)and are situated on the head, butdo not surround the opening ofthe mouth, as is the case with the tentacula ofr190 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.polypes. They consist of circular disks, themargins of which are fringed with rows of cilia,bearing a great resemblance to a crown wheel.This wheel appears to be incessantly revolving,and generally in one constant direction ; givingto the fluid a rotatory impulse, which carriesit round in a continual vortex. The constancyof this motion would seem to indicate that it isrelated to some function of vital importance,such as respiration. But even considered asamechanical action, which is the view we havenow to take of it, this phenomenon is of a natureto excite much curiosity ; for the continuedrevolution round an axis of any part or appendageto the body, is quite inconsistent withany notion we can form of the solid organicattachment of such appendage ; and we canhave no conception of organization extendingthrough the medium of a fluid, or of any substance,which, like a fluid, admits of the continualdisplacement of its parts. Mr. Dutrochethas offered an ingenious solution of this difficulty.He suggests that the revolution of the wheels ofthe Rotifer a may not be real, but apparent only.*The indented margin of each wheel being composedof a material so exceedingly flexible as tobe capable of assuming quickly all kinds of curvatures,may be conceived to be thrown intoundulations, which follow one another round theThe same opinion was advanced long ago by Vice. d'Azyr.WHEEL ANIMALCULES. 191circumference ; each part, in succession, becomingalternately convex and concave, andthus producing the appearance of the actualadvance of the portions that are raised ; whiletheir real motions are only those of elevation anddepression, by the elongation and contraction oftheir perpendicular fibres.Besides possessing extensive powers of locomotion,the infusoria manifest in several ofthe vital functions, as we shall hereafter find, adegree of complication, which appears to entitlethem to a higher station in the animal scale,than that which most naturalists have assignedto them. They are certainly superior to thesponges or the polypi, doomed by nature to bepermanently fixed, like plants, to the same spot;and of which, if we consider them as compoundbeings, the individual animals are often so minuteas to be scarcely visible without the aid ofthe microscope. Mere size, indeed, is of all thecircumstances attendant on organized beings,that which should least be assumed as the criterionof complication or refinement of structure.An object is great or small, only in relation tothe standard of our own limited and imperfectsenses; but with reference to the operations ofcreative power, all such distinctions must vanish.There is not, as far as we have the means ofjudging, in the colossal fabric of the elephant, anystructure more complicated than exists in theminutest insect that crawls unheeded at our feet.THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.§ 5. Acalepha.Floating masses of living gelatinous matterare met with in every part of the ocean ; oftenin vast numbers, and of various forms ; and havingbut little the appearance of belonging to theanimal kingdom. They compose the order Aca-81 ^m^sii^ lepha, of which theMedusa (Fig. 81) maybetaken as the type.They appear, fromtheir organization, tobe raised but a singlestep above polypi ; andin point of activity andlocomotive powers, theyrank among the lowestof those Zoophyteswhich are not permanently fixed to the spotwhere they were first developed. They arealmost wholly passive beings, floating on thesurface of the sea, or remaining at a small depthbelow it, carried to and fro by the motion ofevery tide and current, and destined to be theunresisting prey of innumerable tribes of animalswhich people every part of the ocean.The usual form of a Medusa is that of a hemisphere,with a marginal membrane, like the foldMEDUSA. J 93of a mantle, extending loosely downwards fromthe circumference ; together with a central pedicledescending from the lower surface, like thestalk of a mushroom, and terminating below inseveral fringed laminae, or processes, which havesometimes been denominated tentacula.The whole substance of the body of thesemedusae is semi-transparent and gelatinous, withoutany distinct fibrous structure ; yet it hasconsiderable elasticity, and possesses also somedegree of contractile power. The animal isseen alternately to raise and depress the marginof its hemispherical body, and to flap withthe fringed membrane or mantle, which descendsfrom it, in a manner somewhat similar to theopening and shutting of a parasol. This pulsatorymovement is performed about fifteen timesin every minute, with great regularity : and bythe reaction of the water, the animal is sustainedat the surface ; or by striking the waterobliquely, it may even perform a slow lateralmovement. They descend in the water bysimply contracting their dimensions in everydirection. Sometimes, in order to sink morequickly, they turn themselves over, so that theirconvex part is undermost.Medusae are met with of very various sizes ;the larger abound in the seas around our coast ;but immense numbers of the more minute andoften microscopic species occur in every part ofvol. i. o194 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.the ocean.* In some parts of the Greenlandseas they swarm to such an extent that theygive a visible tinge to the colour of the waves forhundreds of miles. The total number of theseanimals dispersed over that space surpasses theutmost stretch of the imagination. In thesesituations a cubic foot of water, taken indiscriminately,was found by Mr. Scores to containabove 100,000 of these diminutive medusae.Belonging to the tribe of Medusaria is a singulargenus, denominated the Serve, (Fig. 82and 83,) which is remarkable for its organs ofprogressive motion. Its body is either globular,or oblong, and it swims with its axis in a verticalposition. Eight longitudinal bands or ridges,which have been sometimes compared to ribs,The luminous property of sea water, or its phosphorescence,as it is sometimes called, generally arises from the presence ofminute medusae, which are met with in greatest numbers at thesurface, being specifically lighter than the surrounding fluid.Berne. 193extend down its sides, like those of a melon ;and along each of these is attached a set of littlemembranes, extended horizontally, and supportedon radiating fibres ; so that they bear apretty exact resemblance to the fin of a fish.Their action is not unlike that of the wings of abird ; for they are made to flap up and down,striking the water vertically, and communicatingan ascending impulse to the body. This animalis also provided with two very long and slenderprocesses, which come out from the sides of thebody, and from these a great number of stillfiner filaments, or cilia, proceed : the wholeapparatus is highly sensitive and irritable, andon the slightest touch the filaments are throwninto spiral coils, and retract rapidly within thebody. They thus act the part of tentacula, ordelicate organs both of touch and of prehension.*It was observed by Patricius, that whena Beroe is cut into many pieces, each piece continuesto live, and to swim about by the actionof the cilia, which still continue their vibratorymotions.In two other genera of Acalepha, the Portaand the Velella, provision is made for the mechanicalsupport of the soft gelatinous mass, bymeans of an internal cartilage. In the former,this cartilage is of a circular form ; in the latter,See a description of the Beroe pileus, Lam. by Dr. Grant, inthe Transactions of the Zoological Society of London, vol. i. p. 9.190 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.(Fig. 84), it is oval, and bears upon its upperedge a thin pellucid membrane of a triangularshape, which extends the whole length of theupper surface of the body. As this membraneis connected with the cartilage at its middle partonly, while its edges are loose and floating, it ispeculiarly adapted, when above the surface ofthe water, to catch the wind and act as a sail.Such, indeed, appears to be the purpose forwhich it was given to the animal ; enabling it tosteer its course by means of the loose edges, andalso of the tentacula, which extend from thelower side of the body, and act as a rudder,while the sail is impelled by the wind.A construction still more artificial is providedin another family of the same order, denominatedthe Pkt/sa/ida, or Hydrostatic Acalepha.They have attained this latter appellation fromtheir being rendered buoyant by means ofvesicles filled with air, which enable them tofloat without the necessity of using any exertionfor that purpose. The Physalia, or PortugueseMan-of-war, as it is called, (Fig. 85,) is furnishedwith a large air-bladder, of an ovalshape, placed on the upper part of the body :and also with a membrane of a beautiful purplecolour, which, as in the Velella, serves as a sail.These Zoophytes are met with in great numbersin the Atlantic Ocean, and more especially inits warmest regions, and at a considerable dis-acting.197tance from land. In calm weather they float onthe surface of the sea, rearing their purplecrests, and appearing at first like large airbubbles, but distinguishable by the vivid huesof the tentacula which hang down beneath them.Nothing can exceed the beauty of the spectaclepresented by a numerous fleet of these animals,quietly sailing in the tropical seas. Wheneverthe surface is ruffled by the slightest wind, theysuddenly absorb the air from their vesicles, andbecoming thus specifically heavier than thewater, immediately disappear, by diving into thestill depths of the ocean. By what processthey effect these changes of absorption and ofreproduction of air yet remains to be discovered.Other genera, as the Physsophora, have severalof these air-bladders ; but in other respectsresemble the ordinary Medusae, in having nomembranous crest.The Actinia are a tribe of Zoophytes, which,from the general resemblance of their forms tothose of Polypi, are by most naturalists includedunder that order. But they exhibit amuch greater development in their organization; having very distinct muscular fibres, endowedwith strong powers of contraction. Theirdigestive organs, also, as I shall have afterwardsoccasion more fully to notice, are constructedupon a more complicated plan than in the polypus.Fig. 86 exhibits an Actinia in its THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.traced state. When their tentacula, which surroundthe mouth, and are very numerous, arefully expanded, (as shown in Fig. 87,) theseanimals present a striking analogy of form tomany of the compound flowers ; and accordinglythe particular species are named from these resemblances,the sea-anemone, the sea-marigold,the sea-carnation, the sun-joiner, daisy, &c. are seen in great numbers on many shores,adhering by their flat surfaces to rocks, andbeing generally permanently fixed to their abode.When the weather is fine, and the sea calm, it isvery amusing to watch the rapid expansions andretractions of their many coloured tentacula,while they are moving in search of food : to observethe quickness with which they seize onwhatever prey comes within their reach, and tonotice the suddenness with which they collapseinto a round contracted mass, on receiving theslightest injury.Yet these animals are not of necessity confinedto the particular spots where we see themfixed ; for they are capable, when disturbed, ofseeking, by a slow progressive motion, a moreECHINODERMATA.secure abode. Reaumur has minutely examinedthe arrangements of their muscular fibres, andhas described the actions by which they eitherattach themselves to the surfaces of rocks, oreffect their sluggish movements.*§ 6. Echinodermata.Ascending in the scale of organization we cometo the Echinodermata, a class which comprehendsthe families of the Astride, the Echini,the Holothurida, and the Crinoidea, togetherwith other tribes of less note.These animals, both in their general form, andin the arrangement of their internal organs,Memoires de l'Academie des Sciences, 1710, p. 490.200 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.retain, in a very marked manner, the radiateddisposition so characteristic of Zoophytes : forwe find all their parts symmetrically arrangedeither in lines, or in compartments, which proceedfrom a common centre, or axis, and whichare repeated, in regular succession, all round thecircumference (See Fig. 88 to 94). Besides anexternal horny, or semi-calcareous covering, thereis also provided, for the support of the softerparts, a kind of internal skeleton, or jointedframe-work. The organs in the interior of thebody are further supported by membranous walls,which impart mechanical firmness to the fabric.The Asterias, or star-fish (Fig. 88), is so namedfrom its star-like form ; and the number of rayscomposing the star is generally five. Besidesthe tough coriaceous integument, which protectsthe mass of the body, each ray is farther supportedby a series of calcareous pieces, resemblingthose which compose the spinal column of vertebratedanimals, and forming an articulated axis,constructed with the evident design of combiningthe greatest strength with a proper degree of flexibility.Cartilaginous plates are also added for themore special support of the integument. Thisintegument itself is irritable, and has the powerof changing its form, although the muscularfibres by which its motions are effected are noteasily distinguished. Calcareous grains, of a solidAsturias,consistence, are thickly interspersed throughoutits texture ; and these, in various parts of thebody, both in the upper and the under side,often project from the surface in the form ofspines or prickles. They are particularly largearound the mouth of the animal, which opens atthe centre of the under side. These calcareousmasses have a crystalline arrangement, and exhibitin fracture the exact oblique angles characteristicof the primitive rhomboid of carbonateof lime.The under side of each ray (Fig. 95) has alIgroove termed, by Linnaeus, the ambulacrum, oravenue, a name which it has received from itsfancied resemblance to a walk between rows oftrees : for each groove contains a quadruple rowof perforations, like pin holes, through whichsmall fleshy cylindrical processes pass. Theseprocesses extend but a short distance from thesurface ; but they admit of being elongated, orretracted, at the pleasure of the animal, by avery curious mechanism, which I shall presentlydescribe. By bending them on either side, in202 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.their expanded state, the Asterias is capable ofeffecting a slow progressive motion ; so that theseprocesses may be regarded as corresponding tofeet, being levers for the advance of the body.This, it may be remarked, is the first time thatwe meet with organs of that description in ourprogress through the animal kingdom. Each ofthese feet is terminated by a concave disk, whichwhen applied to any flat surface acts as a sucker,on the principles already adverted to.* Reaumurcounted 304 of these feet in each of the fiverays of the star fish, making 1520 in all.f Eachfoot consists of a tube, closed at the outer end,and the stem of which, after passing throughthe aperture in the integument, is dilated into abag or reservoir of fluid ; as is shown in Fig. 97.By the contraction of this reservoir, the fluid itcontains is propelled into the outer portion of thetube, which protrudes by being thus distended ;the foot fixes itself by means of its terminalfleshy disk to the point it touches, and then, byretracting, draws the body along for a short distance.By the retreat of the fluid into its reservoir,the foot is again detached, and ready to bemoved forwards, and is thus made instrumentalin taking another step, by a repetition of the samePage 137.f Memoires de l'Academie des Sciences, 1710, p. 487.echinus. 203process.* From the shortness of these feet,notwithstanding their great number, the advancewhich this animal can make in any particulardirection is excessively slow.Besides this movement of creeping, the Asteriasis capable of bending and unbending each of itsrays ; actions, however, which it can perform butvery slowly, and not to an extent sufficient toaccomplish its removal from one place to another.!The skeleton of the Echinus or sea-urchin,(Fig. 91), is still more artificially framed thanthat of the Asterias. It has a spheroidal form,like that of an orange ; the calcareous materialThe mechanism by which the feet are protruded and retractedis illustrated by the diagram, Fig. 97, which exhibits thebladders connected with them, in different states of distentionand contraction. Fig. 96 shows the upper side of the simulacra,and of the bladders connected with the feet. Dr. Grant,from some observations which he made on the structure of thecilia of the Beroe pileus, is led to suspect that the rapid vibrationsof these singular organs in the lowest animals may dependon the undulations of water conveyed through elastic tubesalong their bases, in a manner resembling the injection of thetubular tentacula of Actiniae and Arteries. If this conjecturewere verified, he remarks, one of the most remarkable phenomenaof animal motion, though one of the most frequent, would losemuch of its present marvellous character.+ In addition to these larger tubes, there exists also a smaller set,which pierce the skin in different places, and are channels forthe absorption of the water used in respiration. These I shallhave occasion to notice more particularly hereafter.THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.employed in its construction, instead of formingisolated grains, is accumulated and extendedinto polygonal plates(Fig. 98), the edgesof which are dovetailedinto each other.The form of eachpiece is that of alengthened hexagon ;and the whole are regularly arranged in rows,like a mosaic or tesselated pavement. Simulacraare also seen on the surface of the shell,passing vertically down the sides of the sphere,similar to the meridians of a globe ; and containing,like those of the Asterias, a double rowof perforations.*On the outer spherical surface of the externalcrust, there are formed a great numberof calcareous tubercles, arranged with beautifulregularity and symmetry in double lines, passing,like meridian circles, from the upper to thelower pole of the sphere. Each appears, whenmagnified, to be a smooth and solid ball, projectingfrom the surface of one of the polygonalplates of the crust. These balls serve for theAn architecture of a still more curious description is exhibitedin the calcareous frame-work that has been provided for thesupport of the teeth, and other organs of mastication, with whichthis animal is furnished. The structure of these organs will benoticed when treating of that function.support of the spines,* which have grooves orsockets at their base, allowing of their accurateapplication to the spherical surface of the tubercles.They thus constitute ball-and-socketjoints, allowing of free motion in all directions.Each joint is connected with the plate on whichit turns, by means of the integument, whichacts the part of a capsular ligament ; and setsof radiating muscular fibres are provided foreffecting the movements of the spines. Byemploying these spines as levers, the Echinusadvances with great facility along plane surfacesat the bottom of the sea. This animalis also aided in its progressive motion by theemployment of suckers, which are placed atthe end of the slender tubes, protruding fromthe pores of the simulacra, and analogous tothose of the Asterias.The Spa tang us, a genus belonging to this order,buries itself in the sand by the action of itsspines, which on its under surface are short,thick, and expanded at the ends, like the handleof a spoon, with the convexity downwards ; andwhich have a limited rotatory motion. Thosewhich grow from the sides are more slender,It has been ascertained by Mr. Harbinger, that the structureof these spines is crystalline, and that their cleavage presentsthe exact rhomboidal angles characteristic of carbonateof lime. See his Translation of Mois's Mineralogy, vol. ii.p. 91.206 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.and taper towards the extremities, and whennot in use they fall flat upon the body withtheir points directed backwards. Besides these,there are a few longer bristles, arranged in acrescent on the back, and converging till theirpoints meet, but capable of being erected toa perpendicular position. The animal, whenplaced on sand, commences its operations byrevolving the lower spines, thus soon creatinga hollow quicksand, into which it sinks by itsown weight so far as to enable the lowest ofthe lateral spines to cooperate with them, byscattering and throwing up the loosened particles; while these, at the same time, contribute,by their reaction, still farther to depress thebody. As the animal sinks, a greater numberof spines are brought into action, and its progressbecomes more rapid ; while the sand,that had been pushed aside, flows back, andcovers the body, when it has sunk belowthe level of the surface. In this situation thelong dorsal bristles come into play, preventingthe sand from closing completely, and preservinga small round hole for the admission ofwater to the mouth and respiratory organs.*Whenever, in following the series of organicstructures, new forms are met with, we alwaysThe account here given is taken from Mr. Osier's papers inthe Philosophical Transactions for 1826, p. 347.ECHINUS. 207find them accompanied by corresponding modificationsin the processes of development. Theorganization of the animals belonging to thelowest division of the series is not sufficientlyperfect to afford the means, which are suppliedin the higher animals, of removing or modifyingthe substances that have at any time been deposited,and suffered to harden. Hence thestructures composed of these substances remainunchanged during the life-time of the animal,although they may continue to receive additionsof new layers of the same material, depositedupon their surface by the soft parts in contactwith them ; for it is through the medium of thesoft parts alone that these materials are supplied.All the solid structures of zoophytes are formedby this process, and they are subjected to allthe consequences of this law of increase. Asthese consequences are important in their relationto the conditions of growth, and to the formswhich result, it will be necessary to direct ourattention to them more particularly.The influence which this mode of increaseby superficial depositions may have, in changingthe form of the original structure, will dependaltogether upon the relative situations of the softsecreting organ and the hard part on whichit is to deposit new layers : for, as every newlayer must occupy the situation of the soft organwhich has formed it, it must displace the latter,208 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.and push it back for a space equal to its ownthickness. In process of time, the addition of numerouslayers having led to successive encroachmentsof the solid substance, the latter will havebeen displaced to an extent which must sooneror later become sensible. If the soft organs havesufficient room for their expansion, as is thecase when they are external to the hard axisof the zoophyte, the growth of that axis may goonwithout impediment ; and no change needtake place in the general figure of the parts,since their relative proportions and situationsmay be preserved unaltered. But this cannothappen when the new materials are to be depositedon the internal surface of a membrane,or a shell, which completely encloses the softparts : for the additions thus made to the thicknessof the layer must encroach upon the spacewithin ; and, that space being limited, the softparts contained in it will not merely cease togrow, but will be actually contracted in theirdimensions : and if the process of depositionwere to go on, the space occupied by the softorgans would at last be entirely filled up withsolid matter, and the cavity be obliterated. Accordinglyit is necessary, whenever cells, intendedfor the lodgement of soft organs, are tobe constructed of hard materials, that the foundationof these cells should be laid, and theirconstruction begun, upon a scale of the sameECHINUS. 209size as that which they are intended to haveat all future periods ; because, as we have justseen, after the innermost layer has been deposited,they admit not of any future enlargementof their cavity. Thus we find that, in the caseof polypes which are lodged in cells, the wallsof these cells must be completed before the softpolypous portion has attained its full expansion ;for were it at first built of a smaller size, proportionedto that of the young polype, it wouldprevent all farther growth.The globular shell of the Echinus, which isexternal to the soft parts that nourish it, andwhich yet grows from a very minute sphereto one of large dimensions, keeping pace withthe gradual expansion of the internal organs,might appear to be an exception to the generallaw. Nature has, however, accomplished herpurpose without deviating from her usual plan ;first, by dividing the shell of the Echinus intoa great number of small pieces ; and secondly,by giving to each piece the polygonal form,which is best adapted to their mutual and perfectjunction, without leaving any interveningspaces. Thus has she provided for the enlargementof the whole structure, by admitting ofadditions being made to the margins of eachof the separate polygonal pieces; fresh layersof calcareous substance being deposited on theunder side, and on the edges of each, in pro-vol.I. p210 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.portion as the expansion of the contents of theshell causes their separation. That such a successionof deposits has taken place, may easilybe seen, by minutely examining the textureof the plates, which will be found marked byconcentric polygonal lines. (Fig. 99.)The spines of the Echinus must be formed bythe successive deposition of layers on their outersurface, as appears from the examination oftheir structure, when a longitudinal section ofthem has been made. The lines exhibiting thesuccession of layers are seen in Fig. 100, whichrepresents such a section. Hence they are probablydeposited by the membrane which coversthem during the whole period of their growth.There is probably no series of animals that exemplifyin so marked a manner as the Echinodermata,the gradations which nature has observedin passing from one model of constructionto another of a totally different aspect, throughevery intermediate form. What shapes can bemore diversified, and apparently irreducible to acommon standard, than ; those of the star-likeAsterias, (Fig. 88) of the globular Echinus, (Fig.91) and of the lily-shaped Pentacrinus ; (Fig. 94)and yet we find these passing the one into theother by the most gradual transitions ? Settingout from the star with five slender rays, whichis the standard form of the Asterias ; we find therays, in succeeding species, assuming graduallyGRADATION IN THE ECHINODERMATA. 211a greater breadth at their base, and their sidesjoining at more obtuse angles : the star-likeform is gradually effaced, and the outline israther a pentagon, with its sides curved inwards(Fig. 89). We soon perceive this curvaturegiving place to a straight line, so that the shapebecomes an exact pentagon. The next changeeffected is in the angles of this pentagon, whichby degrees are lost in a general rounded outline ;still, however, preserving its flatness. Thisstage is attained in the Stella, and the Cly-pester. (Fig. 90.) We next find that, in theSpatangns, the thickness increases ; though atfirst with an oval outline, and with severalchanges in the situation of the mouth of the animal.At length, after passing through many intermediatesteps, we arrive at the perfectly circularand spheroidal Echinus. (Fig. 91.) If wemight be permitted to conjecture the objects ofall these changes, which occur in this continuousgradation, we might not unreasonably supposethem to be the concentration of the internalorgans into one compact mass, and the retrenchmentof all the external appendages. It is alsocurious to observe, how, amidst all these modifications,the double rows of perforations, whichconstitute the simulacra, retain their situations,diverging in five equidistant lines from one ofthe extremities of the axis, and winding round tothe other.212 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.Returning to the Asterias, we can trace changesequally gradual, though in an opposite sense, inanother series, which presents a striking contrastwith the former. Here, instead of the retrenchmentof the appendages, we find themgreatly developed, and amplified in every possibledegree. The rays of the Asterias becomenarrower, while their length is at the same timeincreased ; the vital organs, and also the tubularfeet, are gradually withdrawn from them, and retirewithin a central disk, to which the slenderrays, now bereft of feet, become mere appendages.Such is the condition of the Ophir.(Fig. 92.) By the prolongation and tapering ofthese rays to slender filaments, they acquire agreater prehensile power, and twine with easeround their prey. We next find their numberaugmented ; it is at first doubled, then tripled,and at length indefinitely augmented. Theyalso become branched, subdividing by simplebifurcations, as in the Euryale palmiferum (Fig.93) ; next into minuter ramifications, as in theCaput Menace, where the thousands of filamentshave the appearance of a tangled web, whichdefies all attempts at unravelling.The steps are but short from the Comatula tothe Crinoidea, or lily-shaped tribe, (of which,Fig 94, representing the Pentacrinus europe's, isan example); for they consist chiefly in theMOLLUSCA. 213addition of a jointed stalk, which is made to proceeddownwards from the centre of the wholeassemblage of rays, and which is to serve asacommon stem for sustaining the whole mass ;while the branches themselves are carried up,and folded inwards. The lower joint of thefoot-stalk is a little expanded, in order to procurea more extensive base of support ; and thewhole structure thus presents a remarkable resemblanceto a liliaceous plant.Chapter III.MOLLUSCA.§ 1 . Mollusca in general.The series of animal structures, arranged accordingto their mechanical functions, conductsus next to the Mollusca; an assemblage ofbeings which was first recognised as constitutingone of the primary divisions of the animal kingdomby Cuvier, the greatest naturalist of moderntimes. A vast multitude of species, possessingin common many remarkable physiological charactersare comprehended in this extensive class.In all, as their name imports, the body is of soft214 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.consistence ; and it is enclosed more or less completelyin a muscular envelope, called the mantle,composed of a layer of contractile fibres, whichare interwoven with the soft and elastic integument.Openings are left in this mantle for theadmission of the external fluid to the mouth andto the respiratory organs, and also for the occasionalprotrusion of the head and the foot, whenthese organs exist. But a large proportion ofthe animals of this class are acephalous, that is,destitute of a head, and the mantle is then occasionallyelongated to form tubes, often of considerablelength, for the purpose of conductingwater into the interior of the body.Mollusca, with the exception of a few amongthe higher orders, are but imperfectly furnishedwith organs of locomotion. The greater number,indeed, are formed for an existence as completelystationary as the Zoophytes attached to a fixedbase. The Oyster, the Muscle, and the Limpet,for example, are usually adherent to rocks at thebottom of the sea, and are consequently dependentfor their nourishment on the supplies of foodcasually brought within their reach by the wavesand currents of the ocean. This permanent attachmentto the solid body on which they fixtheir abode, does not, however, take place tillthey have arrived at a certain period of theirgrowth : for at the commencement of their sej)a-MOLLUSC A. 215rate existence, that is, immediately after theyare hatched, they are free to move in the water,and to roam in search of a habitation. In thisrespect, therefore, they preserve an analogy withthe gemmules of sponges, and of polypi, whichexercise locomotive powers only in the earlystages of their development.*The organization of the Mollusca being unfittedfor the construction of an internal skeleton, Naturehas ordained that the purposes of mechanicalsupport and protection shall be answered bythe formation of hard calcareous coverings, orshells, the result of a peculiar process of animalproduction. These shells are formed either ofone piece, or of several ; the separate pieces, ineither case, being termed valves; so that shellsThis analogy is strengthened by the circumstance that themovements of many of these animals, in the first periods of theirexistence, are effected by the same mechanism of vibratory ciliawhich we found to be instrumental in the progression of the industryanimalcules, and of the young of polypi. On observing thefirst evolution of the ova of the Buccinum natum, Dr. Grantfound them to consist of groups of spherical gelatinous bodies,which soon become covered on one side with a transparent envelope,the rudiment of the future shell ; while, on the other side,the gelatinous matter is extended outwards, so as to form themargin of an internal cavity, of which the entrance is surroundedwith vibratory cilia, and in the interior of which a revolution ofparticles is seen, indicating a constant current of fluid. The vibrationsof these cilia are perceived long before the pulsations ofthe heart, and even before any appearance of that organ is visible;216 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.may be either univalve, bivalve, or midtivalve,according as they consist of one, two, or morepieces. Univalve shells have generally more orless of a spiral form, and are then called turbinatedshells. In a few, the cavity of the shell isdivided by transverse partitions into numerouscompartments. Some Mollusca have internalshells for the defence and support of particularorgans ; and others have shells which are partlyexternal, and partly internal. As respects theirshape, colour, and appearance, shells admit ofinfinite diversity ; yet, as will presently be shown,all are composed of the same kind of material ;and their production and increase are regulatedby the same uniform laws.they are, indeed, the first indications of life in the embryo. Thecilia are in activity even before the animal is hatched; for whileconfined within the egg, it is seen almost continually revolvinground its centre ; a motion which appears destined to bring a constantsupply and renewal of sea water into the interior of the organization,in order to perfect the formation of the shell before theanimal is, as it were, launched into the ocean. Possibly, also, thecontinued friction of the cilia against the interior of the egg maytend to abrade it, and open a passage for the young animal. Nosooner has the animal effected its escape, than it darts rapidlyforwards by the motion of its cilia. The same appearances havealso been observed by Dr. Grant in the young of different Mollusca,such as the Doris, Elis, &c. which have no shell. — Eden.Journal of Science, Vol. vii.MOLLUSCA ACEPHALA.§ 2. Acephala,The Mollusca which inhabit bivalve shells, suchas the Oyster, the Muscle, and the Cockle, are allacephalous. The two valves of the shell areunited at the back by a hinge joint, often veryartificially constructed, having teeth that lockinto each other : and the mechanism of this articulationvaries much in different species. Thehinge is secured by a substance of great strength.It is seen in Fig. 101,which shows the valvesof the Unto batavia, withthe connecting ligament.This ligament iscomposed of two kindsof texture : the one,which is always external,is strictly ligamentous; that is, perfectlyinelastic : theother has more of theproperties of cartilage, being highly elastic, andformed of parallel series of condensed transversefibres, directed from the hinge of one valve to thesimilar part of the other, and having generallya deep black colour, and a pearly lustre. Thecartilage is always situated within the ligament,218 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.sometimes in immediate contact, and formingwith it one and the same mass : at other timesplaced at a distance, in a triangular cavity,amongst the teeth of the hinge. The closing ofthe valves produces, in all cases, a compressionof the cartilage, the elasticity of which tends,therefore, to separate the valves from each other ;that is, to open the shell.During the life of the animal, the usual andnatural state of its shell is that of being keptopen for a little distance, so as to allow of theingress and egress of the water necessary for itsnourishment and respiration. But as a securityagainst danger, it was necessary to furnish theanimal with the means of rapidly closing theshell, and retaining the valves in a closed state.These actions being only occasional, yet requiringconsiderable force, are effected by a muscularpower : for which purpose sometimes one,sometimes two, or even a greater number, ofstrong muscles are placed between the valves,their fibres passing directly across from the innersurface of the one to that of the other, and firmlyattached to both. —a^ 1 hey are named, fromtheir office of bringingthe valves towardseach other,the adductor muscles.Fig. 102, which re •presents the section of an oyster, shows the situa-molluscaAC RPHALA . 219tion of the hinge l, the adductor muscle a, andthe transverse direction of its fibres, with respectto the valves. When these muscles are not inaction,the elasticity of the cartilage attached tothe hinge is sufficient to separate the valves ;but as they were not intended to open beyond acertain extent, it was necessary to provide somelimitation to the action of the cartilage. The adductormuscle might, it is evident, be called intoplay "to counteract that action ; but this would requirea constant muscular exertion, and a greatexpenditure, therefore, of vital force. Naturehas always shown a solicitude to economize muscularpower, whenever a substitute could be had,and such a substitute she has here provided, byuniting with the muscle an elastic ligament, of apeculiar construction.

This departure fromthe ordinary structure is probably occasioned by a new conditionintroduced into the economy of the animal in consequence of itsbeing fitted for excavating passages through hard rocks. It isfurnished, for this purpose, with a complicated boring apparatusmoved by many muscles, and requiring great freedom of action.Fig. 103 represents the shell of the Pholas Candida extremelyexpanded, in order to show the hinge, together with the ligament,l ; the long and thin process of shell, p, to the ends ofwhich, on each side, a pair of fan-shaped muscles, more particularlyemployed in boring, are attached; and the two adductormuscles, a a, which retain the valves in contact independentlyof the ligaments. For a full description of this apparatus, Imust refer to a paper by Mr. Osier, on burrowing and boringmarine animals, contained in the Phil.

The Solen, or razor-shellfish, has a foot of a cylindrical shape,tapering at the end, and much more resemblingin its form a tongue than a foot. In some bivalvesthe dilatation of the foot is effected by a curioushydraulic mechanism : the interior of the organis formed of a spongy texture, capable of receivinga considerable quantity of water, whichthe animal has the power of injecting into it,and of thus increasing its dimensions.The foot of the Mytilus oculis, or commonmuscle, can be advanced to the distance of twoinches from the shell, and applied to any fixedbody within that range. By attaching the pointto such body, and retracting the foot, this animaldrags its shell towards it ; and by repeating theoperation successively on other points of thefixed object, continues slowly to advance.This instrument is of great use to such shellfishas conceal themselves in the mud or sand,which its structure is then peculiarly adaptedfor scooping out. The Cardium continually employsits foot for this purpose : first elongating itand directing its point downwards, and insinuatingit deep into the sand ; and next, turningup the end, and forming it into a hook, bywhich, from the resistance of the sand, it isMOLLUSCA ACEPHALA. 223fixed ill its position, and then the muscles whichusually retract it are thrown into action, and thewhole shell is alternately raised and depressed,moving on the foot as on a fulcrum. The effectof these exertions is to drag the shell downwards.When the animal is moderately activethese movements are repeated two or threetimes in a minute. The apparent progress isat first but small; the shell, which was raised onits edge at the middle of the stroke, falling backon its side at the end of it ; but when the shell isburied so far as to be supported on its edge, itadvances more rapidly, sinking visibly at everystroke, till nothing but the extremity of the tubecan be perceived above the sand. Mr. Osier,who has given us this account,* observes thatthe instinct, which directs the animal thus toprocure a shelter, operates at the earliest periodof its existence. The Mya tnmcata, when fullygrown, will not attempt to burrow ; but onplacing two young ones, which were scarcelymore than a line in length, and apparently butjust excluded, on sand, in a glass of sea water,he found that they buried themselves immediately.By a process exactly the inverse of this, thatis, by doubling up the foot, and pushing withit downwards against the sand below, the shellPhilos. Trans, for 1826, p. 349.224 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.may be again made to rise by the same kind ofefforts which before protruded the foot. By thisprocess of burrowing the animal is enabledquickly to retreat when danger presses : andwhen this is past, it can, with equal facility,emerge from its hiding place.The Cardium can also advance at the bottomof the sea along the surface of the soft earth,pressing backwards with its foot, as a boatmanimpels his boat onwards, by pushing with hispole against the ground, in a contrary direction.It is likewise by a similar expedient that theSolen forces its way through the sand, expandingthe end of its foot into the form of a club.The course of these locomotive bivalves mayreadily be traced on the sand by the furrowswhich they plough up in their progress.This, as well as many other of the bivalvemollusca, are enabled by the great size andflexibility of this organ to execute various othermovements, of which, from the habitual inactivityof animals of this class we should scarcelyhave supposed them capable. The Telling isremarkable for the quickness and agility withwhich it can spring to considerable distances byfirst folding the foot into a small compass, andthen suddenly extending it; while the shell isat the same time closed with a loud snap.The Pimp, or Marine Muscle, when inhabitingthe shores of tempestuous seas, is furnished,MOLLUSCA ACEPHALA. 225in addition, with a singular apparatus for withstandingthe fury of the surge, and securingitself from dangerous collisions, which mighteasily destroy the brittle texture of its shell.The object of this apparatus is to prepare agreat number of threads, which are fastened atvarious points to the adjacent rocks, and thentightly drawn by the animal ; just as a ship ismoored in a convenient station to avoid the buffetingof the storm. The foot of this bivalve iscylindrical, and has, connected with its base, around tendon of nearly the same length as itself,the office of which is to retain all the threadsin firm adhesion with it, and concentrate theirpower on one point. The threads themselves arecomposed of a glutinous matter, prepared by aparticular organ. They are not spun by beingdrawn out of the body like the threads of thesilk-worm, or of the spider, but they are cast inamould, when they harden, and acquire a certainconsistence before they are employed. Thismould is curiously constructed ; there is a deepgroove which passes along the foot from the rootof the tendon to its other extremity ; and the sidesof this groove are formed so as to fold and closeover it, thereby converting it into a canal. Theglutinous secretion, which is poured into thiscanal, dries into a solid thread ; and when it hasacquired sufficient tenacity, the foot is protruded,and the thread it contains is applied toVOL. I. Q226 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.the object to which it is to be fixed; its extremitybeing carefully attached to the solid surfaceof that object. The canal of the foot isthen opened along its whole length, and thethread, which adheres by its other extremity tothe large tendon at the base of .the foot, is disengagedfrom the canal. Lastly, the foot is retracted,and the same operation is repeated.Thread after thread is thus formed, and appliedin different directions around the shell.Sometimes the attempt fails in consequence ofsome imperfection in the thread ; but the animal,as if aware of the importance of ascertainingthe strength of each thread, on which itssafety depends, tries every one of them as soonas it has been fixed, by swinging itself round, soas to put it fully on the stretch : an action whichprobably also assists in elongating the thread.When once the threads have been fixed, theanimal does not appear to have the power ofcutting or breaking them off. The liquidmatter out of which they are formed is so exceedinglyglutinous as to attach itself firmly tothe smoothest bodies. It is but slowly produced,for it appears that no Pinna is capable of formingmore than four, or at most five threads in thecourse of a day and night. The threads thatare formed in haste, when the animal is disturbedin its operations, are more slender thanthose that are constructed at its leisure. Reau-MOLLUSCA GASTEROPODA. 227mur, to whom we are indebted for these interestingobservations, states also that the marinemuscles possess the art of forming thesethreads from the earliest periods of their existence; for he saw them practising it, when theshells in which they were inclosed were notlarger than a millet seed.* In Sicily, and otherparts of the Mediterranean, these threads havebeen manufactured into gloves, and other articles,which resemble silk.§ 3. Gasteropoda.The Mollusca which inhabit univalve or turbinatedshells, belong to the order of Gasteropoda,and have a more highly developed organizationthan the Acephala, The part which performsthe office of a foot is a broad expansion offleshy substance, occupying nearly the wholeunder surface of the animal, and forming a flatdisk, capable of being applied to the planealong which it moves.This is seen in thePlanorbis (Fig. 1 05, d).In some species it isfashioned into a pro-memoiresde l'Academie des Sciences : 1711, p. 118 to 123.Poli conceived that these threads are dried muscular fibres ; anopinion which has been adopted by Blainville.228 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.jesting ridge which cuts its way, like a ploughshare,along the surface on which it moves.The bands of muscular fibres, which composethe principal part of its structure, are short,and are interlaced together in a very intricatearrangement. All the columns of their fibresterminate at the surface of the disk ; so thatwhen the animal is crawling their successiveactions produce a visible undulatory motion ofthat surface. The effect of these actions is thatdifferent parts of the plane on which it movesare laid hold of in succession, and each correspondingportion of the animal is dragged along,so that the body advances by a slow and uniformgliding motion. The operation of thismechanism may easily be seen in a snail, bymaking it crawl on a pane of glass, and viewingthe movement of its disk from the other side ofthe glass: the regular undulations which advancein the direction of the motion of the snail,but with twice the velocity, present a curiousand interesting spectacle.A mucilaginous secretion generally exudesfrom the surface of the disk, and tends to increaseconsiderably its power of adhesion, bothwhen the animal is crawling, and also when itfixes itself on any surface. In the Patella, orlimpet, this adhesion is greatly favoured by theconical form of the shell, which, having a circularbase, enables the muscles of the disk, bySTRUCTURE OF SHELLS. 229their efforts to create a vacuum underneath it,to command the whole hydrostatic pressure ofthe superincumbent water, as well as of theatmosphere above the water. Besides the muscularbands contained in the substance of thefoot, other sets of fibres are provided for thepurpose of protruding or of retracting the wholemember, and of moving it in different directions.The foot of the Buccinum natum, or Whelk,is capable of great dilatation by means of fourtubes, which open from the surface near thegullet, and convey into it a large quantity ofwater. It may, by this means, be distended toa size even greater than the shell itself; so thatthe opening which it forms in the sand is largeenough to receive the shell, when the latter isdrawn down by the contraction of the muscleswhich are attached to the foot.* The foot ofthe Scylla is grooved, for the purpose ofenabling the animal to lay hold of the steinsand branches of marine plants, and advancealong them by a gliding motion.The head is generally furnished with tubulartentacula, which the animal protrudes for thepurpose of feeling its way as it advances, andwhich are quickly retracted, by the reversion ofthe tube, when they are touched or irritated.This mechanism is matter of familiar observa-osier,Phil, trans, for 1826, p. 352.230 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.tion in the tentacula, or horns, of the snail and ofthe slug, which are terrestrial mollusca belongingto this order. The former of these has a turbinatedshell of the ordinary structure : the latter,though extremely similar in its internal structureto the snail, is destitute of any externalshell ; but is furnished, instead of it, with a smallinternal plate of cartilage, giving support tosome of the vital organs.§ 4. Structure and Formation of the Shells ofMollusca.The structure and formation of the shells of molluscousanimals is a subject of much interest incomparative physiology, as presenting manybeautiful illustrations of the laws by which theinorganic parts of the living system are increasedin their dimensions. ,All shells are composed of two portions, theone consisting of particles of carbonate of lime,the other having the character of an animal substance,and corresponding in its chemical propertieseither to albumen or to gelatine. Themode in which these two constituent parts areunited, as well as the nature of the animal portion,differ much in different kinds of shell ; andit is chiefly in reference to these circumstancesSTRUCTURE OF SHELLS. 231that shells have been divided into two classes,namely, the membranous and porcellaneous shells.In shells belonging to the first of theseclasses, the carbonate of lime is united with amembranous substance deposited in layers, whichmay be separated from one another, either bymechanical division with a sharp instrument, orby the slow actions of air, water, or other decomposingchemical agents. The shells of thelimpet, of the oyster, and of almost all the largerbivalve mollusca which reside in the ocean areof this kind. They are usually covered with athick outer skin, or epidermis; and their textureis of a coarser grain than that of other shells.If a shell of this description be immersed inan acid capable of dissolving carbonate of lime,such as the muriatic or nitric acids properlydiluted, at first a brisk effervescence is produced,but this soon slackens, and the carbonateof lime contained in the shell is slowly dissolved ;the membranous layers being left entire, andsufficiently coherent to retain the figure of theshell, but, having lost the earthy material whichgave them hardness, they assume their naturalform of soft and flexible plates.Many membranous shells exhibit, on severalparts of their internal surface, a glistening, silvery,or iridescent appearance.* This appear-examplesof this nacreous structure, as it is termed, occurin the shells of the Haliotis, or Sea-ear, and of the Anton, orfresh water muscle.232 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.ance is caused by the peculiar thinness, transparency,and regularity of arrangement of the outerlayers of the membrane, which, in conjunctionwith the particles of carbonate of lime, enter intothe formation of that part of the surface of theshell. The surface, which has thus acquired apearly lustre, was formerly believed to be a peculiarsubstance, and was dignified with the appellationof mother of pearl, from the notion thatwas entertained of its being the material of whichpearls are formed. It is true, indeed, that pearlsare actually composed of the same materials, andhave the same laminated structure as the membranousshells ; being formed by very thin concentricplates of membrane and carbonate oflime, disposed alternately, and often surroundinga central body, or nucleus :but Sir David Brewster hassatisfactorily shown that theiridescent colours exhibitedby these surfaces are whollythe effect of the parallelgrooves consequent upon theregularity of arrangement inthe successive deposits ofshell.* The appearance of these grooves or striaewhen highly magnified is shown in Fig. 106. fPhilosophical Transactions for 1814, p. 397.f See also a paper on this subject by Herschel in the EdinburghPhilosophical Journal, ii. 114, from which the annexedfi L> ure is taken.STRUCTURE OF SHELLS. 233This iridescent property may be communicatedto shell lac, sealing wax, gum Arabic, balsam ofTolu, or fusible metal, by taking an accurate castorimpression of the surface of mother of pearlwith any one of these substances.*Miscellaneous shells have a more uniform andcompact texture than those of the former class.The animal matter which unites the carbonateof lime is less in quantity and not so evidentlydisposed in layers ; but it is more equally blendedwith the earthy particles, with respect to whichit appears to perform the office of a cement,binding them strongly together, although it hasof itself but little cohesive strength. The Cyprceaand the Volute are examples of porcellaneousshells.In shells of this kind the carbonate of limeassumes more or less of a crystalline arrangement;the minute crystals being sometimes inthe form of rhombs, and sometimes in that ofprisms. In the former case they are composedof three distinct layers, as may be seen bymaking sections of any of the spiral univalveshells, or simply by breaking them in variousWhen these shells decay and fall to pieces, they separateinto numerous thin scales of a pearly lustre. The fine scales thusobtained from the P lacuna, or window oyster, are employed bythe Chinese in their water-colour drawings to produce the effectof silver.

Each layer is composed of very thinplates, marked by oblique lines,which show the direction of thecrystalline fibres.* The directionof the layers and fibres isalso rendered manifest by theplanes of cleavage, when theyare broken into fragments. Theplates of the outer and innerlayers are always directed fromthe apex of the cone to its base, so as to followthe direction of the spire : while, on the contrary,those of the intermediate plate form concentricrings round the cone parallel to its base. Thusthe fibres of each layer are at right angles tothose of the layer which is contiguous to it ; anarrangement admirably calculated for givingstrength to the shell, by opposing a considerablecohesive resistance to all forces tending to breakit, in whatever direction they may be applied.*We here find that a principle, which has only oflate years been recognised and applied to theThese lines are shown in the diagram, Fig. 107, which representsa longitudinal section of a shell of this kind. A is theouter layer, of which the fibres pass obliquely downwards. B isthe middle layer, having fibres placed at right angles with theformer. C is the third, or inner layer, the fibres of which havea direction similar to the outer layer. Within this layer there isfrequently found a deposit of a hard, transparent, and apparentlyhomogeneous calcareous material, D. Of this latter substance Ishall afterwards have occasion to speak.STRUCTURE OF SHELLS. 235building of ships, namely, that of the diagonalarrangement of the frame work, and the obliqueposition of the timbers, is identical with thatwhich, from the beginning of creation, has beenacted upon by nature in the construction ofshells.When the form of the crystals is prismatic,the fibres are short, their direction is perpendicularto the surface, and the prisms are generallyhexagonal. This structure is observablein the Teredo gigantic from Sumatra,* and alsoin many bivalves, such as those belonging to thegenera Vincula and Pinna.When porcellaneous shells are subjected tothe solvent action of acids, the animal matter intheir composition offering but little resistance,there is a considerable and long continued effervescence.The solution of the carbonate of limeproceeds rapidly, in consequence of the speedydisintegration of the animal substance, which isbroken up, and partly dissolved. The remainderis reduced to minute fragments, which subsidein the form of flakes or scales to the bottom ofthe fluid. Poli has given a minute and elaboratedescription of the appearances of these fragmentsof membrane, when seen under the microscope. |In this shell the crystalline appearance is so perfect, thatwhen some fragments were sent to England, they were mistakenfor a mineral production. Home ; Lectures, I. 53.f See his folio work on the Testacea of the Two Similes.230 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.The difference between the textures of thesetwo kinds of shell is further illustrated by theimpression made upon them by fire. Miscellaneousshells, when exposed to a red heat, giveout neither smell nor smoke : they lose indeedtheir colour, but retain their figure unaltered.Membranous shells, on the contrary, emit astrong fetid odour, and become black ; afterwhich the plates separate, and the structure fallsto pieces.This variety in the composition and structureof different kinds of shell is accompanied bycorresponding modifications of their mechanicalproperties. The toughness of the fibrous basisof membranous shells imparts to them greaterstrength than is possessed by the porcellaneousshells, which, in consequence of the tenuity anduniform intermixture of the animal cement withthe calcareous particles, present a harder andmore transparent, but at the same time morebrittle compound. It is these qualities, togetherwith their smooth enamelled surface, often beautifullyvariegated with brilliant colours, and presentingaltogether a close resemblance to porcelain,that have procured them the name they bear.When the transparency and brittleness of theseshells are very great, they have been consideredas forming another class, and they have beentermed Vitreous shells, from their making a nearerapproach to glass. Some shells present intermentOF SHELLS. 237date textures between the membranous and theporcellaneous.All those surfaces of the shell on its outer sidewhich are not in contact with any part of theanimal, are originally covered with an epidermis: * which, however, is frequently rubbed offby friction.The process employed by nature for the formationand enlargement of the shells of themollusca was very imperfectly understood priorto the investigations of Reaumur, who may beconsidered as having laid the first solid foundationsof the theory of this branch of comparativephysiology His experimental inquiries havefully established the two following general facts :first, that the growth of a shell is simply theresult of successive additions made to its surface ;and secondly, that the materials constitutingeach layer, so added, are furnished by the organizedfleshy substance, which he termed theskin of the animal, but which is now known bythe name of the mantle, and not by any vesselsor other kind of organization belonging to theshell itself.If a portion of the shell of a living snail, forinstance, be removed, which can be done withoutinjury to the animal, since it adheres to the fleshThis membrane has been termed the Periosteum.f Memoires de l'Academie des Sciences, 1709, p. 367, and1716, p. 303.238 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.only in one point, there is formed, in the courseof twenty-four hours, a fine pellicle, resembling aspider's web, which is extended across the vacantspace, and constitutes the first stratum of thenew shell. This web, in a few days, is found tohave increased in thickness, by the addition ofother layers to its inner surface ; and this processgoes on until, in about ten or twelve days, thenew portion of shell has acquired nearly the samethickness as that which it has replaced. Itssituation, however, is not exactly the same, for itis beneath the level of the adjacent parts of theshell. The fractured edges of the latter remainunaltered, and have evidently no share in theformation of the new shell, of which the materialshave been supplied exclusively by the mantle.This Reaumur proved by introducing throughthe aperture a piece of leather underneath thebroken edges, all round their circumference, soas to lie between the old shell and the mantle :the result was that no shell was formed on theoutside of the leather ; while, on the other hand,its inner side was lined with shell.The calcareous matter which exudes from themantle in this process is at first fluid and glutinous; but it soon hardens, and consolidates intothe dense substance of the shell. The particlesof carbonate of lime are either agglutinatedtogether by a liquid animal cement, which unitesthem into a dense and hard substance, resentOF SHELLS. 239being porcelain ; or they are deposited in a bedof membranous texture, having already the propertiesof a solid and elastic plate. This explainsthe laminated structure possessed by many shellsof this class, such as that of the oyster, of whichthe layers are easily separable, being merelyagglutinated together like the component leavesof a sheet of pasteboard.It has long been the prevailing opinion amongnaturalists that no portion of a shell which hasbeen once deposited, and has become consolidated,is capable of afterwards undergoing anyalteration by the powers of the animal thatformed it. Very conclusive evidence has, in myopinion, been adduced against the truth of thistheory, by Mr. Gray, in a paper lately read tothe Royal Society. From a variety of facts, itappears certain that on some occasions the molluscousanimal effects the removal of large portionsof its shell, when they interfere with itsown growth, or are otherwise productive of inconvenience.We should at the same time regardthese cases in the light of exceptions to theordinary rule that a portion of shell once formedremains ever after unchanged, while it continuesto be connected with the animal which producedit. In a general way, indeed, we may considerthe connexion between the animal and the shellas mechanical, rather than vital ; and the shellitself as an extraneous inorganic body, forming240 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.no part of the living system : for whatever shareof vitality it may have possessed at the momentof its deposition, all trace of that property issoon lost. Accordingly we find that the holesmade in shells by parasitic worms are neverfilled up, nor the apertures of the cavities somade covered over, unless the living flesh of theanimal be wounded ; in which case an exudationof calcareous matter takes place, and apearly deposit is produced. The worn edges ofshells, and the fractures, and other accidentswhich befall them, are never repaired, except asfar as such repairs can be made by the additionof materials from the secreting surfaces of themantle. It is found that shells may be impregnatedwith poisonous metallic salts, such as thoseof copper, without any detriment to the animalsthey enclose.The power of secreting the materials of shelldoes not usually extend to the whole of the surfaceof the mantle, but is generally confined tothe parts near the margin, composing what istermed the collar. The calcareous substance isalways poured out underneath the epidermis,*that is, between this outermost layer of integer.Gray considers the external membrane of the shell, orepidermis, as formed by the outer edge of the plates of animalsubstance, which have scarcely any calcareous matter in theircomposition, and which are soldered together into a membranouscoat.FORMATION OF SHELLS. 241ment, and the subjacent corium, which is incorporatedwith the mantle, and may be regardedas forming one and the same organ.*The shape of the shell depends altogether onthe extent and particular form and position ofthe secreting organ. The animal, on its exclusionfrom the egg, has already a small portion ofshell formed. The simplest case is that inwhich this rudiment of shell is a concave disk.We may conceive the animal, covered by itsmantle, to expand the border of this organ, andextend it beyond the edge of the shell, where itthen forms a new layer of shell ; and this newlayer, being applied to the inner or concave surfaceof the original shell, will, of course, extenda little way beyond its circumference. Thesame happens with the succeeding layers, eachof which being larger than the one which haspreceded it, projects in a circle beyond it ; andthe whole series of these conical layers, of increasingdiameters, forms a compound cone, ofwhich the outer surface exhibits transverse lines,showing the successive additions made to theA secreting power is also, in some instances possessed bythe foot, as is exemplified in some of the gasteropoda, where itforms an operculum, or calcareous covering to the mouth of theshell. Mr. Gray also ascertained that in the Cymbia, the Olive,and the Ancillarice, shell is deposited, and most probably secretedby the upper surface of the foot, which is very large, andnot by the mantle, which is small, and does not extend beyondthe edge of the mouth.VOL. I. R242 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.shell in the progress of its increase. The Patella,or limpet, is an example of this form ofstructure.But in by far the greater number of mollusc awhich inhabit univalve shells, the formation anddeposition of the earthy material does not proceedequally on all sides, as happens in the patella.If the increase take place in front only,that is, in the fore part of the mantle, the continualdeflexion thence arising necessarily givesthe shell a spiral form, the coils being simplyin one plane. This is the case in the Planorbis,(Fig. 105) the Spirula and the Nautilus. Mostcommonly, however, as in the Buccinum, andAchatina, (Fig. 108) the deposit of shell takesplace laterally, and more on one side than on theother ; hence the coils produced descend as theyadvance, giving rise to a curve, which is continuallychanging its plane, being converted from aspiral to a helix, a term of Geometry borrowedfrom the Latin name of the common snail, which,FORMATION OF SHELLS. 243as is well known, has a shell of this form. Fig.108, which represents the shell of the Chat inazebra, and of which Fig. 109 shows a longitudinalsection, may serve as an example of a shellof this kind. The axis of revolution is termedthe Columella, and the turns of the spiral are denominatedichor Is. In consequence of the situationof the heart and great blood-vessels relativelyto the shell, the left side of the mantle ismore active than the right side, so that the lateralturns are made in the contrary direction, that is,towards the right.* There are a few species,however, where, in consequence of the heartbeing placed on the right side, the turns of thespiral are made to the left. Such shells havebeen termed sinistral, or reversed shells : but thisleft-handed convolution seldom occurs among theshells of land or fresh water mollusca.It results from this mode of formation that theapex both of the simple and of the spiral cone isthe part which was formed the earliest, and whichprotected the young animal at the moment of itsexclusion from the egg. This portion may generallybe distinguished by its colour and appearancefrom that which is afterwards formed. Thesucceeding turns made by the shell in the progressof its growth, enlarging in diameter as theyThe terms right and left have reference to the position of theanimal when resting on its foot ; the head being of course in front.See Gray, Zool.

During the growth of the animal, as thebody extends towards the mouth of the shell, itsposterior end often quits the first turn of the spire,and occupies a situation different from that whichit had originally. In these cases the cavity atthe apex of the spire is filled up with solid calcareousmatter of a hardness not inferior to thatof marble.Such is the general form of turbinated shells.It sometimes happens, however, as in the Conus,that the upper surface of the spiral scarcely descendsbelow the level of the original portion ofthe shell, which in the former disposition of itsparts would have been the apex : while thelower portions of the spiral turns shoot downwardsso as to form a pointed process ; thus thewhole is still a cone, but reversed from theformer, the part last formed being the outersurface of the cone and the circumference ofthe apparent base, or flat surface, of which thecentral part is the one first formed.Various causes may occur to disturb the regularityof the process of deposition, by which theshell is enlarged in its dimensions : at one timeaccelerating, and at another retarding, or totallyarresting its growth. These irregularities areproductive of corresponding inequalities in thesurface of the shell, such as transverse lines, orstriae. Whenever an exuberance of materialsFORMATION OF SHELLS. 245has led to a sudden expansion of growth, whichhas again soon subsided, a projecting ridge isproduced in the direction of the margin of themantle at the time this happens. This changegenerally recurs at regular periods, so that theseridges, or ribs, as they are often called, succeedone another at equal distances along the courseof the spiral turns.It not unfrequently happens, that at differentperiods, a sudden development takes place inparticular parts of the mantle, which become inconsequencerapidly enlarged, shooting out intolong slender processes. Every part of the surfaceof these processes has the power of secretingand forming shell, so that the portion of shellthey construct, being consolidated around eachfleshy process, must necessarily have at first theshape of a tube closed at the extremity. Asfresh deposits are made by the secreting surface,which are in the interior of the tube, theinternal space is gradually filled up by thesedeposits ; the process of the mantle retiring tomake way for their advance towards the axis ofthe tube. In the course of time, every part ofthe cavity is obliterated, the process of the shellbecoming entirely solid. Such is the origin ofthe many curious projecting cones or spineswhich several shells exhibit, and which havearisen periodically during their growth fromtheir outer surface. In the Murex these pro-theMECHANICAL FUNCTIONScesses are often exceedingly numerous, and occurat regular intervals, frequently shooting out intovarious anomalous forms. In many shells ofthe genus Strombus these spines are of greatlength, and are arranged round the circumferenceof the base, being at first tubular, andafterwards solid, according to the period ofgrowth. This is exemplified in the Pterocerascorpio (Lamarck) of which Fig. 110 shows theearly, and Fig. Ill the later period of growth.A limit has been assigned by nature to thegrowth of molluscous animals, and to the shellswhich they form : and there is a certain epochof their existence, when considerable changestake place in the disposition of the mantle,and in its powers of secretion. Often we findit suddenly expanding into a broad surface,adding to the shell what may be termed a largelip. Sometimes no sooner has this been accom-FORMATION OF SHELLS. 247polished than the same part again shrinks, andthe mantle retires a little way within the shell,still continuing to deposit calcareous layers,which give greater thickness to the adjacentpart of the shell : and at the same time narrowits aperture, and materially alter its generalshape and aspect. Thus it happens that theshells of the young and of the old individuals ofthe same species are very different, and wouldnot be recognised as belonging to the same tribeof mollusca. This is remarkably the case withthe shell of the Cyprcea, or Cowrie, which in theearly stage of its growth, (Fig. 112) has theordinary form of an oblong turbinated shell :but from the process j must described taking placeat a certain period, the mouth of the shell (asshown in Fig. 113), becomes exceedingly narrow,and the edges of the aperture are markedby indentations, moulded on corresponding processesof the mantle.* But in this instance thechange does not stop here ; for both edges of themantle next take a wider expansion, turningover the outer surface of the shell, and passingon till they meet at the upper convex part, orback of the shell, forming what has been termedthe dorsal line. They deposit, as they proceed,• Similar changes occur in the shells of the Ovula (spindles),Erato (tear-shells), and Marginal, (dates).

This new plateof shell completely envelopesthe original shell, giving it anew covering, and disguisingits former character. A transversesection (Fig. 114) atonce shows the real steps bywhich these changes havetaken place.*Changes equally remarkable are observed tooccur in the interior of the shell at differentstages of its growth. On the inner surface ofthe Mitre, the Volute, and other shells of a similarkind, there is deposited a layer of a hard semitransparentcalcareous material, having a vitreousappearance.! The thickness of the layer, whichthus lines the cavity of the shell, is greater as itapproaches the apex ; and where the spire isAccording to Bruguiere, there is reason to believe that theanimal of the Cyprcea after having completed its shell, in themanner above described, still continuing to grow, and beingincommoded for want of space, quits its shell altogether, andsets about forming a new one, better suited to its enlargeddimensions. It is stated also that the same individual is evencapable of forming in succession several shells. Blainville,however, considers it impossible that the living animal can everquit its shell. Malacologie, p. 94.f This is the substance represented at d, Fig. 107, p. 234.FORMATION OF SHELLS. 249much elongated, or turreted, as it is called,* thisdeposition entirely fills the upper part, which, inthe early condition of the shell, was a hollowspace with thin sides. The purpose answeredby this deposit is evidently to give solidity andstrength to a part which, by remaining in itsoriginal state, would have been extremely liableto be broken off by the action of the sea.In other cases a different expedient is adopted.The animal, instead of fortifying the interior ofthe apex by a lining of hard shell, suddenlywithdraws its body from that part, and builds anew wall or partition across the cavity, so as toprotect the surface thus withdrawn. That portionof the shell, which is thus abandoned, beingvery thin and brittle, and having no support internally,soon breaks off, leaving what is termeda decollated shell ; examples of this occur in theCerithium decollation, the Julius decorates,&c. The young of the genus Magnus has avery thin shell of a crystalline texture ; butwhen it has attained its full size, and has formedfor itself a lodgment in a coral, it fills up thecavity of the shell with a glassy deposit, leavingonly a small conical space for its body ; and itcontinues to accumulate layers of this material,so as to maintain its body at a level with the topof the coral to which it is attached, until theAs in the genera Turritella, Terra, Cerithium, and .250 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.original shell is quite buried in this vitreous substance.The forms of the Cone and Olive shells are suchas to allow but a small space for the convolutionsof the body of the animal, which accordinglybecomes, in the progress of its enlargement, excessivelycramped. In order to obtain morespace, and at the same time lighten the shell,the whole of the two exterior layers of the innerwhorls of the shell are removed, leaving onlythe interior layer, which is consequently verythin when compared with the other whorl, thatenvelopes the whole, and which, retaining itsoriginal thickness, is of sufficient strength togive full protection to the animal. That thischange has actually been effected is very distinctlyseen in the Coins (Fig. 115) by examininga vertical section of that shell, as is representedin Fig. 116. All the inner partitions ofthe cavity thus laid open are found to be ex-formationOF SHELLS. 251extremely thin and transparent, and to consistonly of the innermost lamina of the originalshell ; as will appear on tracing them up to thatouter portion of the section b b, which lies oneach side of the proper apex of the shell, andwhich forms the apparent base. The lines onthis part of the section indicate the thicknesswhich each successive whorl had originally, andwhen it was itself the outermost whorl. Thesection also shows the vitreous deposit whichlines the upper parts of the cavity, and whichcompletely fills up the smaller turns of the spire,near the apex.*There are, indeed, instances among shells ofthe total removal of the interior whorls. This isfound to occur in that of the genus Auricula,which are molluscous animals, respiring by meansof pulmonary organs. In the young shell of thistribe, the partitions which separate the cavitiesof the whorls are incomplete, and twine parallelto each other ; but they wholly disappear as theanimal approaches to maturity. In other cases,the animal is found to remove exterior portionsof shell formerly deposited, when they lie inthe way of its farther growth, and when the mouthof the spire is advancing over the irregular sureFig. 117, which is a transverse section of the same shell,shows the spiral convolutions, and the comparative thinness ofe inner portions. It also forms a striking contrast with a similarsection of the Cypraea, Fig. 114.252 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.face of the preceding whorls. Thus we oftenfind that the ridges, ribs, or processes which hadbeen deposited on the surface of the shells ofthe Triton, Murex, &c. are removed to makeway for the succeeding turn of the spire. Inother cases, however, no such power of destroyingportions of shell previously deposited seems toexist ; and each successive whorl is mouldedupon the one which it covers.It may also be observed, that some molluscahave the means of excavating the shells of otheranimals on which they may choose to fix, forthe purpose of forming a convenient lodgementfor themselves. The Pileopsis (or fool's cap) hasthis faculty in a remarkable degree ; and it isalso met with occasionally in Siphonarice andPat dice. The common Patella, or limpet of ourown coasts, often, indeed, forms for itself, bysome unknown process, a deep cavity out of acalcareous rock.When the animal which inhabits a spiral shellretires within it, the only part of its body that isexposed to injury is that which is situated at themouth of the shell. With a view to its protection,it constructs, in many instances, a separateplate of shell, adapted to the aperture, and denominatedan Operculum. This piece is constructedby a process similar to that by which the rest ofthe shell is formed ; that is, by the deposition ofFORMATION OF SHELLS. 253successive layers on the internal surface, sometimesin an annular, and sometimes in a spiralform. If an operculum were to be constructedof a considerable size, and were connected tothe shell itself by a regular hinge, it would beentitled to be considered as a distinct valve.Here, therefore, we perceive, as was remarkedby Adamson, a connecting link between theunivalve and the bivalve testacea. A Claudiusis another kind of covering, serving also for protection,and consisting of a thin spiral plate ofshell, attached to the columella by an elasticspring, by which the plate is retracted when theanimal retires into its shell. It thus correspondsexactly in its office to a door, opening and closingthe entrance as occasion requires. An Epicis a partition of a membranous or calcareousnature, constructed merely for temporaryuse.

Havingformed this first barrier, the animal afterwardsconstructs a second, of a membranous nature,situated more internally than the first, and at alittle distance from it. If at any other season,while the snail is in full vigour, the experimentbe made of surrounding it with a freezing mixture,it will immediately set about constructinga covering for its protection against the cold ;and it works with such diligence, that in thecourse of an hour or two, it will have completedits task, and formed an entire epiphragma.*When the genial warmth of returning spring haspenetrated into the abode of the snail, the animalprepares for emerging from its prison, by secretinga small quantity of a mucous fluid, whichloosens the adhesion that had taken place betweenthe epiphragma and the sides of the aperture; and the former is, by the pressure of thefoot of the snail, thrown off. The whole of thisGray, Zoological Journal, i. 214.FORMATION OF SHELLS. 255process of construction has to be renewed, on everyoccasion when another covering is required.*One great use of these coverings is to preventevaporation from the surface of the body of theanimal. It is thus that Snails, Bulimi, &c. maybepreserved for months, and even years in atorpid, but living state, ready to be restored tothe active functions of life, when sufficient wateris supplied. tThe enlargement of bivalve shells is conductedon the same principles as that of univalves ; theaugmentation of bulk taking place principally atthe outer margin of each valve, and correspondingwith the growth of the included animal.The order of succession in which the layers aredeposited is clearly indicated by the lines on thesurface, which frequently appear of differenthues from the addition of colouring particles secretedat particular periods by the mantle.The shells of Oysters and other acephalousmollusca which adhere to rocks, are oftenmoulded, during their growth, to the surfaces towhich they are applied. The mantle, being exonepiphragma differs from true shells in having no adhesionin any part to the animal which formed it.f A remarkable instance of this apparent reviviscence of snails,which had lain for many years in a dormant state in a cabinetof shells, and which crawled out on being accidentally put intowarm water, is recorded in the Philosophical Transactions for1774, p. 432.256* THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.exceedingly flexible, accommodates itself to all theinequalities it meets with, and depositing eachsuccessive layer of shell equally on every part,the figure of the surface is assumed, not only bythe valve in contact with it, but also by the othervalve, which is formed by the opposite surface ofthe mantle,* and which during its formation wasimmediately superposed on the thin edge of theother valve, while it was deflected by the irregularsurface on which it grew. As the enlargementof the shell proceeds, it was necessary that themuscle, which closes the valves, and is attachedto their inner surface, should be gradually removedto a greater distance from the hinge, sothat it may preserve its relative situation withregard to the whole shell, and retain undiminishedits power of acting upon the valves. For thispurpose its adhesions are gradually transferred,by some unknown process, along the surface ofthe valves ; and the progress of the removal maygenerally be distinctly traced by the markswhich are left in the shell at the places beforeoccupied by the attachments of the muscularfibres. The same process takes place whenthere are two or three muscles instead of one.A few genera of Mollusca, such as the P /tolas,have, in addition to the two principal valves,small supplementary pieces of shell.

Pteropoda.In the Mollusca belonging to the two orderswhich have now passed under our review, namely,the Acephala and Gasteropoda, the mantle, whileit folds over the principal viscera of the body,leaves apertures for the admission of water to thegills, or organs of respiration. But there exist afew genera having the sac formed by the mantleclosed on every side ; a structure which rendersit necessary to adopt a different arrangementwith regard to the gills, and to place them externally,and we then find them spreading outlike a pair of wings, on each side of the neck.Since this general closing of the mantle precludes,also, the formation of any organ of progressivemotion corresponding to a foot, advantageis taken of the projection of the gills to em-vol.i. s258 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.ploy them as oars for the purpose of enabling theanimal to swim through the water.Mollusca of this description are found in greatabundance in the colder regions of the oceansurrounding both the north andsouth poles ; and other speciesare also met with, though insmaller numbers, in the tropicalseas. The Clio borealis,of which Fig. 120 is a representation,is the most perfectspecimen of this form of construction.It swarms in theArctic seas, and constitutes the principal food ofthe whale. The position of its gills, which performthe office of oars or feet, at the same timethat they resemble in their shape and action thewings of an insect, are characters which havesuggested the title of Pteropoda, given byCuvier to this order of Mollusca.§ 6. Cephalopoda,Following the progress of organic development,we now arrive at a highly interestingfamily of Mollusca, denominated the Cephalopoda,and distinguished above all the preceding ordersby being endowed with a much more elaborateorganization, and a far wider range of faculties.MOLLUSCA CEPHALOPODA,The Cephalopoda have been so named from theposition of certain organs of progressive motion,which are situated on the head, and like the ten-maculaof the Polypus, surround the opening ofthe mouth. (See Fig. 121). These feet, or arms,or tentacula, if we choose so to call them, are long,slender, and flexible processes, exceedingly irritable,and contractile in every part, and providedwith numerous muscles, which are capable ofmoving and twisting them in all directions withextraordinary quickness and precision. Theyare thus capable of being employed as instruments,not only of progressive motion, but alsoof prehension. For this latter purpose they arein many species peculiarly well adapted, because,being perfectly flexible as well as highly muscular,they twine with ease round an object of anyshape, and grasp it with prodigious force. Inaddition to these properties they derive a remarkablepower of adhesion to the surfaces ofbodies from their being furnished with numeroTHE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.rous suckers all along their inner sides. Eachof these suckers, as shown separately in Fig.122, is usually supported on a narrow neck, orpedicle, and strengthened at its circumferenceby a ring of cartilage. Their internal mechanismis more artificial than the simple constructionalready described (p. 137) : for when thesurface of the disk is fully expanded, as shownin Fig. 123* b, we find that it is formed of agreat number of long slender pieces, resemblingteeth closely set together, and extending fromthe inner margin of the cartilaginous ring, inthe form of converging radii, to within a shortdistance of the centre, where they leave a circularaperture. In the flattened state of the sucker,this aperture is filled by the projecting part of asofter substance, which forms an interior portion,capable of being detached from the flat circle ofteeth, when the sucker is in action, and ofleaving an intervening cavity. The form of thiscavity is exhibited in Fig. c, which represents aperpendicular section of the whole organ, andwhere the central portion, or principal mass ofthe sucker is drawn away from the circular disk,MOLLUSCA CEPHALOPODA. 26 ithe inner margin of which appears like a row ofteeth. It is evident that by this mechanism,which combines the properties of an accuratevalve, with an extensive cavity for producingrarefaction, or the tendency to a vacuum, thepower of adhesion is considerably augmented.*So great is the force with which the tentaculaof the cuttle-fish adhere to bodies by means ofthis apparatus, that while their muscular fibrescontinue contracted, it is easier to tear away thesubstance of the limb, than to release it from itsattachments. Even in the dead animal I havefound that the suckers retain considerable powerof adhesion to any smooth surface to which theymay be applied.Our attention must first be directed to theremarkable family of Sepia, which comprehendsthree principal genera, namely, the Octopus, theLoUgo, or Calamary, (depicted in Fig. 121),and the common Sepia, or Cuttle-fish. Thefirst of these, the Octopus, which was the animaldenominated Polypus by Aristotle, has eightarms of equal length, and contains in its interiorThe description I have here given is the result of my ownexamination of a large Octopus, which I had lately an opportunityof dissecting: and the annexed figures 123*, a, b, c, arecopied from drawings I made on that occasion, a representsthe sucker in its usual form when not in action : b shows thesucking surface fully expanded: and c is a section of the whole,which had become somewhat flattened by the operation of dividingit.262 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.two very small rudimental shells, formed by theinner surface of the mantle. This shell becomesmuch more distinct in the Loligo, where it iscartilaginous, and shaped like the blade of asword. (Fig. 123). The internal shell of thecommon Sepia is large and broad, and composedwholly of carbonate of lime : it is wellknown by the name of the cuttle-fish bone. Itsstructure is extremely curious ; and deservesparticular attention, as establishing the universalityof the principles which regulate the formationof shells, whether internal or external, andfrom which structures differing much in theiroutward appearance may result. It is composedof an immense number of thin calcareous plates,arranged parallel to one another and connectedby thousands of minute hollow pillars of thesame calcareous material, passing perpendicularlybetween the adjacent surfaces. This shellis not adherent to any internal part of the animalwhich has produced it ; but is enclosed inacapsule, and appears like a foreign body,impacted in the midst of organs, with whichat first sight, it would appear to have no relation.It, no doubt, is of use in giving mechanicalsupport to the soft substance of thebody, and especially to the surrounding muscularflesh ; and thus probably contributes tothe high energy which the animal displays inall its movements. It has been regarded as anMOLLUSCA CEPHALOPODA. 263internal skeleton; but it certainly has no pretensionsto such a designation ; for, although envelopedby the mantle, it is still formed by thatorgan ; and the material of which it is composedis still carbonate of lime. On both these accountsit must be considered as a true shell, andclassed among the productions of the integuments.It differs, indeed, altogether from bonystructures, which are composed of a differentkind of material, and formed on principles ofgrowth totally dissimilar.*Besides tentacula, the Sepia is also furnishedwith a pair of fleshy fins, extending along thetwo sides of the body. The Loligo has similarorgans of a smaller size, and situated only atthe extremity of the body which is opposite tothe head. They have been regarded as therudiments of true fins, which are organs, developedin fishes, and which are supported byslender bones, called rays; but no structure ofthis kind exists in the fins of the Cephalopoda.In swimming, the organs principally employedby cuttle-fish for giving an effective impulseSome analogies have, indeed, been attempted to be tracedbetween the cartilaginous lamina of the Loligo, and the spinalcolumn of the lowest order of cartilaginous fishes : these I shallhave occasion to point out in the sequel. Solid cartilaginousstructures also exist in the interior of the body of the cepha-lopoda, which are considered by some naturalists as indicatingan approach to the formation of an internal skeleton, analogousto that of vertebrated animals.264 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.to the water, are the tentacula. These theyemploy as oars, striking with them from behindforwards, so that their effect is to propel thehinder part of the body, which is thus madeto advance foremost, the head following in therear. They also use these organs as feet formoving along the bottom of the sea. In theirprogress, under these circumstances, the head isalways turned downwards, and the body upwards,so that the animal may be considered asliterally walking upon its head. The necessityof this position for the feet arises probably fromthe close investment of the mantle over thebody ; for although the mantle leaves an aperturein the neck for the entrance of water to the respiratoryorgans, yet, in other respects, it forms asac, closed in every part, except where the head,neck, and accompanying tentacula protrude.In the Calamary, as well as in the commonSepia, two of the arms are much longer thanthe rest, and terminate in a thick cylindricalportion covered with numerous suckers, whichmay not unaptly be compared to a hand.These processes are employed by cuttle-fish asanchors for the purpose of fixing themselvesfirmly to rocks, during violent agitations of thesea ; and accordingly we find that it is only theextremities of these long tentacula that are providedwith suckers, while the short ones havethem along their whole length.MOLLUSCA CEPHALOPODA,The other genera of Cephalopodous Molluscaare, like the Sepia, provided with tentacula attachedto the head. They comprehend animalsdiffering exceedingly in their size : some beingvery large, but a great number very minute,and even microscopic* The shells of theseanimals are often found to contain partitionsdividing them into a number of chambers;hence they have been termed castrated, ormultilocular, or polythalamous shells. The Spirula(Fig. 124) is a shell of this description, ofwhich the cellular structure and numerous partitionsare rendered visible by making a sectionthrough it : (Fig. 125). Some, however, as theArgonaut, or Paper Nautilus, have shells undividedby partitions; and are accordingly termedunilocular, or monothalamous. The shell of theArgonaut is exceedingly thin, and almost pellucid,probably for the sake of lightness, for it isintended to be used as a boat. For the purposeof enabling the animal to avail itself of the inaparticular account has been given of the shells of thesemicroscopic cephalopoda by M. D'Orbigny, in the Annales desSciences Naturelles ; vii. 96.266 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.pulses of the air, while it is thus floating on thewaters, nature has furnished it with a thin membrane,which she has attached to two of thetentacula, so that it can be spread out like a sailto catch the light winds which waft the animalforwards on its course. While its diminutivebark is thus scudding on the surface of the deep,the assiduous navigator does not neglect to plyits tentacula as oars on either side, to direct, aswell as accelerate its motion. No sooner doesthe breeze freshen, and the sea become ruffled,than the animal hastens to take down its sail,and quickly withdrawing its tentacula within itsshell, renders itself specifically heavier than thewater, and sinks immediately into more tranquilregions beneath the surface.*The common Nautilus, which is provided witha similar sailing apparatus, is an inhabitant ofa polythalamous shell (Fig. 126), of which Fig.127 represents the section. The formation ofthis, as well as of other shells of this description,presents very curious phenomena. The animalat certain periods of its growth, finding itselfcramped in the narrow part of the spire, drawsIt must be confessed, however, that the habits of the Argonautare still very imperfectly known. Considerable doubts areentertained whether the shell it inhabits is formed by the animalitself, or whether it is the production of some other, but unknownspecies of Mollusca, and is merely taken possession of by theArgonaut as a convenient habitation, which it can quit and enteragain at pleasure.MOLLUSCA CEPHALOPODA. *2u7up that portion of the mantle which occupied it,thus leaving a vacant space. The surface of themantle which has receded immediately begins tosecrete calcareous matter, which is deposited inthe form of a partition, stretching completelyacross the area of the cavity. As the animalproceeds to increase in size, and to occupy awider portion of the external shell, the samenecessity soon recurs, and the same expedient isagain resorted to. It withdraws its mantle fromthe narrower into the wider part of the shell ;and then forms a second partition, at a little distancefrom the first, corresponding to the spaceleft by the receding of the mantle. This processis repeated at regular intervals, and producesthe multitude of chambers contained in shells, of which the living animal occupiesonly the largest, or that which continuesopen.* The partitions are in general perforatedeither in the centre or at one side, for the purposeof giving passage to a ligament, which preservesthe attachment of the mantle to the apexof the shell. This ligament is often surroundedeither entirely or partially by shell, which formsa tube, denominated the syphon : and portions ofwhich are seen in the section Fig. 127.This structure is extremely prevalent in fossil shells: someof which are spiral, such as the Cornu Ammonia, while othersare straight cones, such as the Bacculite and Orthoceratite.In most of these the partitions are very numerous, and haveundulating surfaces.Chapter IV,Articulate.§ 1. Articulated Animals in general.From the Cephalopoda, the transition is easy tothe lowest order of vertebrated animals. Butpreviously to pursuing the analogies which connectthese two divisions of the animal kingdom,we have to pass in review a very extensive seriesof animal forms, constructed upon a peculiarsystem, and occupying, as well as the Mollusca,a place intermediate between Zoophytes and themore highly organized classes.We have seen that even in those Zoophyteswhich are distinguished from the rest by a moreelaborate conformation of organs, the powers ofprogressive motion are always extremely limited.Nor are the Mollusca in general more highlyfavoured with respect to the degree in whichthey enjoy this faculty. But the greater numberof the animals composing the series we are nowto examine are provided with a complete apparatusfor motion, and endowed with extensivecapacities for using and applying it in variousways. While nature has preserved in the constructionof their vital organs the simplicity whichmarks the primitive modes of organization, andArticulate. 269has adhered to a definite model in the formation ofthe different parts of the system, she has nowheredisplayed more boundless variety in the combinationsof the forms which she has impressedupon the mechanical instruments, both of prehensionand of progression.All the tribes of Zoophytes, and by far thegreater number of Mollusca, are limited by theconstitution of their system, to an aquatic existence.But in following the series of Articulatedanimals, we very soon emerge from the waters,and find structures adapted to progression onland. For this we see that preparation is earlymade in the development of the nascent structures.A farther design, also, soon becomesmanifest; and instruments are given for elevatingthe body above the ground, and fortraversing with rapidity the light and scarcelyresisting atmosphere. This prospective designmay be traced in the whole system of insects;every part of which is framed with reference tothe properties of the medium through whichthese movements are to be performed.§ 2. Annelida,The lowest division of articulated animals comprehendsthose which have a vermiform shape,and which compose the class of Annelida, orAnnulose animals; of which the earth-worm270 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.may be taken as the type, and most familiarexample. In the series of structures whichconstitute this division of the animal kingdom,we may trace remarkable gradations of development,through which nature appears topass in attaining the higher and more perfectconformations.It may be remarked that, in effecting thetransition from Zoophytes to the new model ofconstruction here presented, nature seems tohave wholly abandoned that radiated dispositionof parts, and those star-like forms, so characteristicof the beings which are placed on theconfines of the animal kingdom, and which stillretain an analogy with vegetable structures.She now adopts a more regular law of symmetry; by which all the parts are referable toone longitudinal axis, and also to a verticalplane passing through that axis, and which hasbeen termed the mesial plane. As a direct consequenceof this law, we shall find that in theforms which are hereafter to pass under ourreview, as far as the external organs and generaloutline of the body are concerned, all that existson one side is an exact counterpart, like a reflectedimage, of what is found on the other side.While in the Star-fish, and Echinus, nothing inpoint of situation was definite, excepting theupper and the lower surface, and there was noside which could be exclusively denominatedAngelina.either the right or the left side, and no end thatcould be properly said to be the front, or theback, in Articulated, as well as in Vertebratedanimals, all these distinctions are clearly markedand easily denned.In all the Annelida the firmest parts of thebody, or those which give mechanical support tothe rest, are external, and may be regarded eitheras appendages to the integuments, or as modificationsof the integuments themselves. Theyconsist of a frame work, composed of a series ofhorny bands or rings : their assemblage havingmore or less of a lengthened cylindric shape,and constituting a kind of external skeleton,which encloses all the other organs. This isexemplified in the earth-worm ; in the Pont-bella(Fig. 128), which is a species of leech ;and in the Nereis (Fig. 129). These ringsgive rise to the division of the body into asmany different segments. In some cases, however,we find all these rings compressed into272 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.the form of a flat oval disk. This is the case inthe JErpobdella, of which Fig. 130 is an enlargedrepresentation.In general, the first of the segments intowhich the body is divided, contains the principalorgans of sense, and is sufficiently distinctfrom those which follow to entitle it to the appellationof the head ; while the lengthened prolongationof the opposite extremity, when sucha form is present, may be denominated thetail.The rings which encircle the body are connectedlaterally by a looser and more flexibleportion of integument, and also by layers ofmuscular fibres, curiously collected into bands.The muscular flesh of insects, and other animalsof this class, differs much from that of the largeranimals, being soft and gelatinous in its texture,though endowed with a high degree of irritability,and contracting with great force. Thefibres composing each band are all parallel toone another, and have seldom any tendinousattachments; being generally inserted directlyon the parts they are destined to move. Thusthe adjacent margins of the rings of worms(as shown in the diagram, Fig. 131) are connectedtogether by these muscular bands, whichpass transversely from the one to the other,immediately under the skin, and parallel to theANNELIDA. 273axis of the body. There are generally fourdistinct bands provided ; two running along theback, and two along the lower part of thebody.The effects which result from the action ofthese muscles are such as might easily be anticipated.The lower set must, when contracting,bring the rings nearer to one another at thatlower part ; and when the whole series occupyingthat situation are exerted in concert, theywill raise the body in the form of an arch. Anopposite curvature will be produced by the contractionof the upper bands ; whereby the backwill be bent downwards, and both ends of thebody raised. In proportion as the two bands,situated on each side, act in concert, while theothers are relaxed, the body will be bent laterallytowards that side. When all the fourmuscular bands contract together equally, theirjoint effect will be to bring the rings near toeach other, and to contract the length of theworm ; the skin being at the same time wrinkledand swelled out between the rings.Other muscular bands, attached to the rings,pass from the one to the other in more obliquedirections. By means of these muscles therings may be made to recede at some points,while they approach at others ; so that the bodymay be either twisted laterally on its axis, orVOL. I. T274 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.wholly elongated, according as the actions ofthese oblique muscles are partially or generallyexerted.The skin on the surface of the earth-worm isfurnished, at the parts where it covers the rings,with very minute bristles, called Setce, by meansof which the animal is enabled to fix those partson the ground, while the other portions of itsbody are in motion. Both in the anterior andposterior segments, these hairs are directed towardsthe centre of the animal ; while those onthe middle segments are perpendicular.* Wealmost constantly find, in animals belongingto the order of Annelida, some provision of thiskind. Often it consists of tufts of hair regularlydisposed in rows on each side of the undersurface. In the Nereis (Fig. 1*29), a genus ofsea-worms, there are often above a hundredpair of little tufts of strong bristles : and betweenthese we find tentacula to prevent theanimal from running against any thing by whichit might be injured. They also raise the bodyfrom the ground, for which purpose, as theyAs an instance of the extraordinary multiplicity of speciesexisting in every department of living nature, I may here notice,that of the common earth-worm, apparently so uniform in itsshape, Savigny has lately, by a closer examination, been able todistinguish no less than twenty-two different species, amongthose found in the neighbourhood of Paris alone.ANNELIDA. 275are used under water, very little support is necessary.*Sometimes the whole body is coveredwith hair ; at other times these appendages arein the form of hooks, which, of course, givegreater power of clinging to the objects on whichthey fasten. In some, again, they assume morethe nature of feet, of which they exercise duringprogression all the functions ; being furnishedwith several sets of muscles for adjusting andstrengthening their actions.The mode by which an animal of this descriptionadvances along the ground is verysimple. It first protrudes the head by the elongationof the foremost segments of the body,while the others cling to the earth by meansof the rings, and also of the bristles and otherappendages to the integuments. The headis then applied to the ground, and made thefixed point, and the segments next to it, whichhad been elongated, are now contracted bythe action of their longitudinal muscles ; indoing which, equal portions of the succeedingsegments are necessarily elongated : these arenext contracted ; and so on, in succession, tillthe whole is brought forwards to the head : afterwhich the same series of actions is repeated,beginning with the advance of the head.Home; Lectures, &c. Vol. i. p. 115.THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.Worms often reverse this motion, and are thusenabled to move backwards, or with the tailforemost. *Great variety exists in the forms of the animalsreferable to the type of Annelida. TheGordius, or hair-worm (Fig. 132) is that whichexhibits the greatest development in lengthcompared with the breadth of the body. It hasthe form of a very long and slender thread : theannular structure being indicated only by veryslight transverse folds of the integuments. Noexternal members, nor even tentacula, havebeen given to this simplest of vermiform animals.Many of the animals of this class being softand defenceless, are obliged to consult theirsafety by retreating into holes and recesses, orby burrowing in the sand or mud. One genusSee Home ; Lectures on Comparative Anatomy, Vol. i.p. 114.ANNELIDA. 277only, the Serpula (Fig. 133), forms for itself anexternal shell, which is shaped into a spiral tube.Others, as the Isabella and the Terebella, accomplishthe same object by collecting grains ofsand, or fragments of decayed shells, or othersubstances, which they agglutinate together bymeans of a viscid exudation, so as to form afirm defensive covering, like a coat of mail.Fig. 134 shows this rude architecture in theTerebella conchilega. These coverings, however,composed as they are of extraneous materials,and not being organic productions of the animalsthemselves, are structures wholly foreign to theirsystems. These inhabitants of tubes, the of Cuvier, are generally furnished withtentacula, issuing from the head, which, whenthe rest of the body has retired within the tube,is the only part exposed.The expedient resorted to for progressive motionby the Lumbriciis marinus of Linnaeus(Arenicola piscatorum of Lamarck), is very remarkable.*This worm, depicted in Fig. 135,swarms on all sandy shores, and is dug up ingreat numbers as bait by the fishermen. Itbores its way through the sand by means ofthe peculiar construction of the rings of its head,which, when elongated, has the shape of a re-seethe account given by Mr. Osier, Philosophical Transactionsfor 1826, p. 342.278 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.gular cone. As each ring is so much smallerthan the one behind it as to admit of beingreceived within it, the whole head, when completelyretracted, presents a flat surface. Whenthis disk is applied to the sand, the animal, bygradually projecting the cone, and successivelydilating the rings of which it is composed, opensfor itself a passage through the sand, and thensecures the sides of the passage from falling inby applying to them a glutinous cement, whichexudes from its skin, and which unites the particlesof sand into a kind of wall, or coating.This covering does not adhere to the body, butforms a detached coherent tube, within whichthe animal moves with perfect freedom, andwhich it leaves behind it as it progressivelyadvances : so that the passage is kept perviousthroughout its whole length by means of thislining, which may be compared to the brickworkof the shaft of a mine, or tunnel.An apparatus of a more complex descriptionis provided in the Cerebellum conchilegce, belongingto a tribe of marine worms, which from thepeculiar circumstances of their situation, inhabitingparts of the shore nearly midway betweenhigh and low water, are obliged often toprolong their tubes to a great length throughthe sand ; for, in consequence of the frequentshifting of the sands in storms, these animalsare sometimes buried to a considerable depth,ANNELIDA. 279and at others have several inches of their tubesexposed. In the one case, they must work theirway speedily to the surface ; in the other, theymust dive deeper below it. The manoeuvres ofthe terebella are best observed by taking it outof its tube and placing it under water upon sand.It is then seen to unfold all the coils of its body,to extend its tentacula in every direction, oftento a length exceeding an inch and a half, and tocatch, by their means, small fragments of shells,and the larger particles of sand. These it dragstowards its head, carrying them behind thescales which project from the anterior and lowerpart of the head, where they are immediatelycemented by the glutinous matter which exudesfrom that part of the surface. Bending the headalternately from side to side, while it continuesto apply the materials of its tube, the terebellahas very soon formed a complete collar, which itsedulously employs itself to lengthen at everypart of the circumference with an activity andperseverance highly interesting. For the purposeof fixing the different fragments compactly,it presses them into their places with the erectedscales, at the same time retracting the body.Hence the fragments, being raised by the scales,are generally fixed by their posterior edges, andthus overlaying each other, often give the tubean imbricated appearance.Having formed a tube of half an inch, or an280 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.inch in length, the terebella proceeds to burrow ;for which purpose it directs its head against thesand, and contracting some of the posterior rings,effects a slight extension of the head, which thusslowly makes its way through the mass before it,availing itself of the materials which it meetswith in its course, and so continues to advancetill the whole tube is completed. After this hasbeen accomplished, the animal turns itself withinthe tube, so that its head is next to the surface,ready to receive the water which brings it food,and is instrumental in its respiration. In summer,the whole task is completed in four or fivehours ; but in cold weather, when the worm ismore sluggish, and the gluten is secreted morescantily, its" progress is considerably slower.Tentacula of various kinds are also met withinseveral of the more active and vivacious kindsof angelica, such as the Nereis (Fig. 129), proceedingfrom the margin of the mouth and otherparts of the head. This animal swims withgreat facility by rapid, undulating inflexions ofits body ; and by practising a similar successionof movements in the loose sand at the bottomof the water, it quickly buries itself, and eventravels to considerable distances through thesand, first extending the anterior rings, and thenbringing up the posterior part of the body ; itsprogress being also much assisted by the actionof its numerous bristly feet.*Osier, Phil. Trans. 1826. p. 342.ANNELIDA. 281Facilities for progression are also given by theaddition of tubercles, arranged in pairs alongthe under side of the body, which serve the purposesof feet, and are often furnished with bristlesor hooks. In the Amphitrite, and many othergenera, tufts of hair occupy the place of feet oneach side, and being moved by muscles speciallyprovided for that purpose, serve as leversfor effecting progressive motion.We find the same object accomplished by verydifferent means in other animals of this class.The leech, for instance, having the rings whichencircle its body very numerous and close toeach other, could not well have advanced by theordinary modes of vermiform progression. As asubstitute, accordingly, it has been furnishedwith an apparatus for suction at the two extremitiesof the body, which are formed into disks forthat purpose. By fixing alternately the oneand the other, and contracting or elongating thebody as the occasion requires, the leech canmove at pleasure either forwards or backwards.Thus, while the tail is fixed, the head may beadvanced by lengthening the whole body, andwhen the head is fixed, the hinder sucker canbe brought forwards by the contraction of thebody, and applied to the ground near to thehead, and preparation may thus be made fortaking another step.Most of the parasitic animals which inhabitthe interior cavities of the body, and especially282 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.the alimentary canal, correspond in externalform, as well as in many circumstances of internalconformation, to the Annelida. They composean order denominated the Entozoa.§ 3. Arachnida.In passing from the Annelida to the Arachnida ,an order which comprehends all the species ofspiders, together with animals allied to them inconformation, we find that a considerable advancehas been made in the progress of development.The frame work of the body is more consolidated: and the instruments provided for progressivemotion are shaped into longer and moreperfect levers, are united by a more refined systemof articulation, and are moved by more distinctand more powerful muscles ; so that thebody is elevated from the ground, and enjoys agreater range of action, and a wider sphere ofperception.The rings, which always compose the frameworkof the Annelida, are here consolidated soas to form two principal divisions of the body,the one in front, termed the Cephalic thorax,which contains the organs of sensation, and ofmastication, and also the principal reservoir ofcirculating fluids ; the other, which is behind,and contains the organs of digestion, is termedARACHNIDA. 283the abdomen. In the spider (Fig. 136, whereC is the cephalic-thorax,and a the abdomen) thesetwo portions of the bodyare separated by a deepgroove, which leaves onlya slender pedicle, or tubeof communication betweenthem. There are usually in the malefour pair of legs, constantly articulated with thecephalic-thorax ; but the female is furnished withan additional pair, to enable her to carry hereggs. For the purpose of obtaining an extensivebase of support, the feet of the spider are spreadout in diverging rays, so as to include a verywide circle. They are divided into several joints,those next to the body being termed the haunches,and the succeeding ones the leg, and the tarsus,and each foot is terminated by two, or sometimesthree hooks. Besides these, there are othermembers, resembling feet, which are placed infront of the head, and have affixed to them eithera moveable hook, or pincers, which are employedas organs of prehension, and of offence. Throughthe larger branches of these a canal passes,which opens near the point, and conducts apoisonous fluid into the wounds inflicted by thisformidable weapon.In common with all articulated animals,spiders, in the progress of their growth, cast off*284 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.their outer skin several times, and at regularperiods. In the earlier stages of their existence,although they have the general form of themature insect, yet they have a smaller number oflegs : the last pair not making their appearancetill after the spider has attained a certain size.We may here trace the commencement of thatsystem of metamorphosis, which, as we shallafterwards find, is carried to so great a length inwinged insects.Spiders are endowed with extensive powers ofprogressive motion, and display great activityand energy in all their movements. The longand elastic limbs on which the body is suspended,being firmly braced by their articulations,enable the muscles to act with greatmechanical advantage in accelerating the progressionof the body. Hence these animals areenabled to run with great swiftness, and to springfrom a considerable distance on their prey ;powers which were necessary to those tribes thatlive altogether by the chase. The greater numberof species, however, as is well known, are providedwith a curious apparatus for spinningthreads, and for constructing webs to entangleflies and other small insects. Every species ofspider weaves its web in a manner peculiar toitself: and, besides the principal web, they oftenconstruct in the neighbourhood a smaller one,in the form of a cell, in which they concealARACHNIDA. 285themselves, and lie in ambush for their prey.Between this cell and the principal web theyextend a thread of communication, and by thevibrations into which this thread is thrown, onthe contact of any solid body, the spider is immediatelyacquainted with the event, and passesquickly to the spot, by the assistance of thesame thread.Some species have the power of conveyingthemselves to considerable distances through theair by means of threads which they dart out,and which are borne onwards by the wind,while the spider is clinging to the end of thethread which is next to it. In this manner thesespiders are often carried up to a great height inthe air : and it has been supposed that duringtheir flight they often seize upon gnats and otherflies ; because the mutilated remains of theseinsects are often seen adhering to the threads :this point, however, is still open to muchdoubt.The Natural History of the spider is in manypoints of view highly interesting, not only fromthe great extent to which the organic developmentis carried, and the energy with which allthe functions of animal life are performed ; butalso with reference to the wonderful instinctsdisplayed in the construction of its web, in thesurprise and destruction of its victims, and inthe zealous guardianship of its young. It would286 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.be impossible, in so brief an outline as the one Iam now tracing, to enlarge upon so fertile atopic, without being led too far from the objectI have at present more particularly in view,namely the development of organization withreference to the organs of progressive motion.§ 4. Crustacea.The plan which Nature appears to have commencedin the construction of the Arachnida, isfarther pursued in that of the Crustacea. Theportions into which the external framework ofthe body was divided in the former, are stillfurther consolidated in the latter : they arecomposed of denser materials, and endowedwith greater rigidity; thus not only offering moreresistance to external forces, but also giving afirmer purchase to the muscles which are themoving powers. The limbs, as well as thewhole body, are encased in tubes of solid carbonateof lime : they are articulated with greatcare, and almost always compose hinge joints.The muscles, by which these solid levers aremoved, are lodged in the interior, and theirfibres either pass directly from one point toanother, across the joint; or else they are attachedto cartilaginous plates, which, for thepurpose of receiving the muscles, are made toCRUSTACEA.project into the interior of the upper portion ofthe limb, being themselves immovably connectedwith the lower portion. By this expedient, notonly is the employment of a tendon dispensedwith, but a larger surface is presented for theattachment of the muscles, which by actingalso upon a longer lever, obtain great mechanicaladvantage. It would be superfluous tooccupy more time in explaining the minutiae ofstructure in these joints, because the simple inspectionof the limbs of a crab or lobster willgive clearer ideas of this mechanism than canbe conveyed by any laboured description. Wemust content ourselves with a brief sketch ofthe principal constituent parts of these externalmembers of the Crustacea.The number of pairs of legs is either three orfour : each leg is divided into live pieces. Thepiece h (Fig. 137), next the trunk, is termedthe haunch, to which is united the trochanter,t ; after which come, in succession, the femur288 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.or thigh, f ; two portions of the leg, l ; andthe tarsus, p. The haunch is usually short,being interposed merely as a base for increasingthe extent of motion of the pieces which follow :and sometimes it is itself composed of more thanone piece. The leg is usually divided into twopieces, by a joint. The tarsus is terminated bya single or double hook, and sometimes by apincer, or claw.New organs, not met with among the Arachnida,are here for the first time developed,namely, the Antenna, of which there is one oneach side of the head. They are denominated,in popular language, the feelers ; although it ismore than probable that they perform somefunction of higher importance than that of conveyingperceptions of mere touch. The antenna?consist of slender filaments, composed of a greatnumber of pieces articulated together : and theyare infinitely diversified in their form in thedifferent genera and species, both of Crustaceaand of Insects.The jaws, and other parts connected with themouth, present a great complication of structure;and many of these parts are employed in varioususes besides those of mastication ; such as theseizing of objects, and turning them in variousways for examination ; and, according to theirsuitableness as articles of food, conveying theminto the mouth. These organs are called theCRUSTACEA. 289Palpi, and sometimes the false feet. Theyalways exist in pairs, and take their rise fromthe lower lip, or some adjacent part of the head.The portions of which each is composed arearticulated together and moved by muscles inthe same manner as the ordinary or proper feet.It is worthy of notice, however, that sometimesthe foremost pairs of palpi are shaped more likejaws, and actually perform the office proper tojaws, of compressing and dividing the food previouslyto its introduction into the mouth. Theseauxiliary jaws are then called mandibles. In otherinstances, we see them assuming every varietyof intermediate form between that of mandiblesand of false feet, so that it is often difficult,amidst these gradual transitions of structure, todecide to which of these two kinds of organs aspecimen we meet with properly belongs. It isapparently with a view to evade this difficultythat a term has been invented which shall includethem all, namely, that offeet-jatvs. Thesetransitions are illustrated by the annexed figuresof several of these members in the My sis Patricii;Fig. 138 being that of a mandible, withits feeler, or palpus; Figures 139, 140, and 141,representing the first, second, and third pairof feet-jaws; and Fig. 142, the first pair oftrue feet. It would thus seem as if the sameconstituent element of the fabric is converted byvol. i. u290 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.nature into the one or other of these organs,according as best suits the exigencies of eachparticular case.*In the lobster, the crab, and many otheranalogous Crustacea, the foremost pair of truefeet are also modified to suit a particular purpose; the pincers which terminate them beingexpanded into a claw, and constituting a powerfulorgan of prehension, and a formidableweapon of offence . It resembles a finger andthumb in its power of grasping and stronglycompressing any object on which it seizes; andto enable it to do this with more effect, the inneredges of both parts of the claw are notched orserrated.The large portion of shell which is consolidatedinto one piece, and covers the upper partof the body, is termed the shield, or carapace.The tail of the crab is very short, and is unitedwith the body, appearing as if it had been foldedunder it. The feet-jaws are particularly large,but short : the articulations of the feet are suchas to allow of scarcely any motion but in a transverseplane. This is the cause of the greaterThe labours of Savigny, Audouin and Latreille appear tohave established a complete analogy in the respective componentparts, not only of the feet, feet-jaws, jaws and mandibles, butalso of the palpi and other appendices attached to the head, inall the articulated animals, whether belonging to the classes ofarachnida, Crustacea, myriapoda, or winged insects.CRUSTACEA. 291facility the crab finds in walking side-ways,which it can do with great quickness whenurged by a sense of danger. The lobster, onthe contrary, is better formed for swimmingthan for walking. The hinder part of its bodyis divided into segments, which play upon eachother by a remarkable kind of mechanism, themargins of each portion overlapping the succeedingsegment, and partly enclosing it. Thetail is the principal agent used in swimming,and the whole force of the muscles is bestowedupon its movements. As it strikes the waterfrom behind forwards, the lobster can only swimbackwards ; and it is assisted in this action byfive pair of false feet, which are attached to theunder side of the body, behind the true feet, andwhich terminate in a fin-shaped expansion, givingthem the effect of oars. The extremity of thetail is still more expressly formed for givingeffect to the stroke, being terminated by a numberof flat scales, which, when expanded, presenta broad surface to the water.The calcareous coverings of these Crustaceaare analogous to shell both in structure and composition.They contain, however, some phosphateof lime, in addition to the carbonate. Thecalcareous particles are deposited on a membraneof considerable firmness ; and they together composea dense, but thin and fragile structure,which, in order to distinguish it from the shells292 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.of the mollusca, has been denominated a cast.A solid structure of this kind, as we have alreadyseen, does not admit of increase by the extensionof its own parts: so that in order to allowof the growth of the parts which it encloses, it isnecessary that it be cast off, and exchangedfor a new shell of larger dimensions.The process by which this periodical castingand renewal of the shell are effected, has beenvery satisfactorily investigated by Reaumur.The tendency in the body and in the limbs toexpand during growth is restrained by thelimited dimensions of the shell, which resiststhe efforts to enlarge its diameter. But thisforce of expansion goes on increasing, till atlength it is productive of much uneasiness to theanimal, which is, in consequence, prompted tomake a violent effort to relieve itself; by thismeans it generally succeeds in bursting the shell ;and then, by dint of repeated struggles, extricatesits body and its limbs. The lobster first withdrawsits claws, and then its feet, as if it werepulling them out of a pair of boots : the headnext throws off its case, together with its antennae; and the two eyes are disengaged from theirhorny pedicles. In this operation, not only thecomplex apparatus of the jaws, but even thehorny cuticle and teeth of the stomach, are allcast off along with the shell : and, last of all, thetail is extricated. But the whole process is notCRUSTACEA. 293accomplished without long continued efforts.Sometimes the legs are lacerated or torn off, inthe attempt to withdraw them from the shell ;and in the younger Crustacea the operation is notunfrequently fatal. Even when successfully accomplishedit leaves the animal in a most languidstate : the limbs, being soft and pliant, arescarcely able to drag the body along. They arenot, however, left altogether without defence.For some time before the old shell was cast off,preparations had been making for forming a newone. The membrane which lined the shell hadbeen acquiring greater density, and had alreadycollected a quantity of liquid materials properfor the consolidation of the new shell. Thesematerials are mixed with a large proportion ofcolouring matter, of a bright scarlet hue, givingit the appearance of red blood, though it differstotally from blood in all its other properties. Assoon as the shell is cast off, this membrane, bythe pressure from within, is suddenly expanded,and by the rapid growth of the soft parts, soonacquires a much larger size than the former shell.Then the process of hardening the calcareous ingredientcommences, and is rapidly completed ;while an abundant supply of fresh matter isadded to increase the strength of the solid wallswhich are thus constructing for the support ofthe animal. Reaumur estimates that the lobstergains, during each change of its covering, an294 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.increase of one-fifth of its former dimensions.When the animal has attained its full size, nooperation of this kind is required, and the sameshell is permanently retained.A provision appears to be made, in the interiorof the animal, for the supply of the largequantity of calcareous matter required for theconstruction of the shell at the proper time. Amagazine of carbonate of lime is collected, previousto each change of shell, in the form of tworounded masses, one on each side of the stomach.In the crab these balls have received the absurdname of crab's eyes; and during the formationof the shell they disappear.It is well known that when an animal of thisclass has been deprived of one of the claws, thatpart is in a short time replaced by a new claw,which grows from the stump of the one whichhad been lost. It appears from the investigationsof Reaumur, that this new growth takes placemore readily at particular parts of the limb, andespecially at the joints ; and the animal seemsto be aware of the greater facility with which arenewal of the claw can be effected at theseparts ; for if it chance to receive an injury atthe extremity of the limb, it often, by a spontaneouseffort, breaks off the whole limb at itsjunction with the trunk, which is the pointwhere the growth more speedily commences.The wound soon becomes covered with a delicateCRUSTACEA. 29-5white membrane, which presents at first a convexsurface : this gradually rises to a point, and isfound on examination to conceal the rudiment ofa new claw. At first this new claw enlargesbut slowly, as if collecting strength for the morevigorous effort of expansion which afterwardstakes place. As it grows, the membrane is pushedforwards, becoming thinner in proportion as itis stretched ; till at length it gives way, and thesoft claw is exposed to view. The claw nowenlarges rapidly, and in a few days more acquiresa shell as hard as that which had preceded it.Usually, however, it does not attain the samesize ; a circumstance which accounts for ourfrequently meeting with lobsters and crabs whichhave one claw much smaller than the other.In the course of the subsequent castings, thisdisparity gradually disappears. The same powerof restoration is found to reside in the legs, theantennae, and the jaws.We must naturally be curious to learn, if possible,from what source these astonishing powersof regeneration are derived.

But this hypothesis is overturned bythe fact that if the animal loses only part of thelimb, it is the deficient portion alone, and not thewhole limb that is regenerated. The sproutingof the new claw bears a strong analogy to thebudding of a plant; both having their originfrom an imperceptible atom, or germ, which iseither formed on the occasion, or had pre-existedin the organization. We are, however, totallydestitute of the means of deciding which of thesealternatives is nearest to the truth. It is but tooprobable that the agents which can effect suchwonderful operations will ever baffle our mostscrutinizing inquiries, and that they are of toorefined an order to come within the reach of themost subtle conjectures that human imaginationcan devise.Chapter V.INSECTS.§ i. Altera*Apterous, or wingless insects form the next termin the series of articulated animals. Closelyallied in their organization to many of the precedingfamilies, they differ from them in beingessentially formed for a terrestrial instead of anaquatic life. Most of the lower tribes of thisAPTEROUS INSECTS. 297order are parasitic, that is, derive their nourishmentfrom the juices of other animals, the skinof which they infest and penetrate, and intowhich they insert tubes for suction. The varioustribes of Acari, or mites, of Pediculi, or lice, ofVicinity or ticks, of Places, or fleas ; together withthe Podura, or spring-tail ; the Lepisma, andthe family of Myriapoda, or mille pedes, arecomprehended in this order. I shall be obligedto pass over these tribes very cursorily, noticingonly a few of the more remarkable circumstancesattending their mechanical conformation.The Pulex is the only apterous insect thatundergoes complete metamorphoses in the courseof its development. In the first stage of itsexistence, it has the form of a long worm, withoutfeet, frequently rolling itself into a spiral coil.It consists of thirteen segments, having tufts ofhair growing upon each. In its mature state ithas six articulated legs, the hindmost of whichare of great size, for the purpose of enabling theinsect to take those prodigious leaps whichastonish us in beings of so diminutive a size, andafford a striking proof of the exquisite mechanismpervading even the lowest orders of theanimal creation.The Podura leaps into the air by a mechanicalcontrivance of another kind ; employingfor this purpose the tail, which is very long, andforked at the end. In its ordinary state this298 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.organ is kept folded under the abdomen, whereit is concealed in a groove. The pieces ofwhich it is composed are articulated together insuch a manner as to admit of their being rapidly-unbentby the action of its muscles, the wholemechanism conspiring to produce the effect of apowerful spring, by which the body is propelledforwards to a considerable distance. In somespecies, this flexible tail has a flattened form,for the purpose of enabling the insect to leapfrom the surface of water, an action which itperforms with apparently as much ease as if itsprung from a solid resisting plane.The Lepisma leaps by means of moveableappendages, placed in a double row along theunder side of the body, and acting like springs.There are eight pair of these members, correspondingin situation and structure to thefalse feet of the Crustacea, and, like them, terminatingin jointed filaments.The Julus and the Scolopendra, which composethe family of the Myriapoda, so called fromthe immense number of their feet, undergo, to acertain extent, a kind of metamorphosis in theprogress of their development. When firsthatched they have often no feet whatever, andresemble the simpler kinds of worms. Legs atlength make their appearance ; but they arise insuccession, and it is not until the later periodsof their growth that these animals acquire theirWINGED INSECTS. 29i)full complement of segments, with their accompanyinglegs. The Julus terrestris, for example,(Fig. 143) has, at its entranceinto the world, only eightsegments and six feet; butacquires in the course of itsdevelopment, fifty segments and about twohundred feet. The anterior legs are directedobliquely forwards, and the rest more or lessbackwards. The mandibles have the form ofsmall feet; as we have seen is frequently thecase in crustaceous animals.§ 2. Insect a plata.Our attention is now to be directed to the morehighly developed Insects, which have beenformed with a view to progression through theair. On these, which compose the most extensiveclass of the whole animal kingdom, Naturehas lavished her choicest gifts of animal powers,as far as they are compatible with the diminutivescale to which she has restricted herself intheir formation. The model she has chosen fortheir construction is that which combines thegreatest security against injurious impressionsfrom without, with the most extensive powers oflocomotion ; and which also admits of the fullest300 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.exercise of all those faculties of active enjoymentwhich are characteristic of animal life. She hasprovided for the first of these objects by enclosingthe softer organs in dense and hornycoverings, which perform the office of an externalskeleton, sustaining and protecting theviscera, and furnishing extensive surfaces ofattachment to the muscles, from the action ofwhich all the varied movements of the systemare derived.The muscular system of perfect insects is exceedinglycomplex. Lyonet has described anddelineated an immense number of muscularbands in the caterpillar of the Cossus, and theplates he has given have been copied in a varietyof books in illustration of this part of thestructure of insects. The recent work of StrausDurckheim affords an equally striking exampleof admirable arrangement in the muscles of theMelolontha vulgaris, or cockchaffer, the anatomyof which has been minutely investigated byWINGED INSECTS. 301that distinguished entomologist. These musclesare represented in Fig. 144, which has beencarefully reduced from his beautifully executedplates. The largest mass of muscular fibres isthat marked a, which depress the wings, andare of enormous size and strength.On examining the different structures whichcompose the solid frame-work of insects, we findthem conforming in every instance to the generaltype of annulose animals, inasmuch asthey consist of thickened portions of integument,encircling the body ; but variously unitedand consolidated, for the manifest purpose ofobtaining greater mechanical strength and elasticitythan if they had remained detached pieces,joined only by membranous connexions. A longflexible body, such as that possessed by the ,could not easily have been transportedthrough the air; for every bend would havecreated a resistance, and have impeded its advanceduring flight. Hence the body of theinsect, which is to be ultimately adapted to thismode of progression, has been shortened by areduction in the number of its segments, andrendered more simple and compact. The segmentsdestined to support the wings have beenexpanded for the purpose of lodging the powerfulmuscles that are to move them ; and rendereddense and unyielding in order to supporttheir action.302 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.Nature has farther provided insects with instrumentsadapted to different kinds of externalactions. They consist of articulated levers, variouslycombined together, and forming legs,claws, pincers, oars, palpi, and, lastly, wings,calculated for executing every variety of prehension,of progression, or whatever other actiontheir wants and necessities require.§ 3. Development of Insects.It would appear as if the final accomplishmentof objects so numerous, so widely different,and so liable to mutual interference, could be attainedonly by the animal being subjected to along series of modifications, and passing throughmany intermediate stages of development. Thepower of flight is never conferred upon the insectin the earlier periods of its existence : forbefore its structure can obtain the lightnesswhich fits it for rising in the air, and before itcan acquire instruments capable of acting uponso light an element, it has to go through severalpreparatory changes, some of which are so considerableas to justify the term of metamorphoses,which has been generally given to them.* ButTransformations quite as remarkable occur in several tribesof animals belonging to other classes : such as those of the Frogamong reptiles, and of the Lerncea among parasitic worms.WINGED Insects. 308transient is the state of perfection in every thingthat relates to animal existence. When the insecthas by a slow development reached thisultimate elaboration of its organs, its life ishastening to a close ; and the period of its perfectstate is generally the shortest of its whole existence.The history of the successive stages of developmentof insects opens a highly interestingfield of philosophical inquiry. For a certain periodof the early life of these animals, the growthof all the parts appears to proceed equably anduniformly : but at subsequent epochs, some partsacquire a great and sudden increase of size, andothers that were in a rudimental condition becomehighly developed, and constitute what appear tobe new forms of organs, although their elementswere in existence from a much earlier period.The modifications which the harder and moresolid structures of insects exhibit in the progressof these changes, are particularly remarkable, asillustrating the principles on which the developmentis conducted. The researches of modernentomologists have led to the conclusion that theframe work, or skeleton of insects, is alwaysformed by the union of a certain determinatenumber of parts, or elements, originally distinctfrom one another, but which are variously joinedand soldered together in the progress of growth :frequently exhibiting a great disproportion in304 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.the comparative expansion of different parts.The enlargement of any one part, however, exercisesa certain influence on all the neighbouringparts, and thus are the foundations laid ofall the endless diversities which characterize theseveral species belonging to each tribe andfamily.In the progress of development, we may recognizetwo principles, which, though apparentlyopposite to each other, concur and harmonize intheir operation : these are expansion and concentration.Thus while those segments of bodywhich follow the head are greatly enlarged, inorder to support the more recently developedorgans of progressive motion, they are also moreconsolidated, and rendered stronger by the unionof several pieces which were before separate.The hinder segments, having no such appendagesto support, are less dilated, and the wholebody is much shortened by the approximation ofthe segments, which in this way compose theabdomen, or hinder division of the insect.The progress of the metamorphoses of insectsis most strikingly displayed in the history of theLepidopterous, or butterfly and moth tribe.*The four periods of the existence of the Bombyx mori, orthe moth of the silk worm, are shown in the annexed engravings,Fig. 145 are the eggs; Fig. 146, the Larva, or caterpillar ; Fig.147, the Pupa, or chrysalis; and Fig. 148, the Imago, or perfectinsect.DEVELOPEMENT OF INSECTS.The egg, which is deposited by the butterfly, givesbirth to a caterpillar ; an animal, which, in outwardshape, bears not the slightest resemblanceto its parent, or to the form it is itself afterwardsto assume. It has, in fact, both the externalappearance, and the mechanical structure of aworm. The same elongated cylindric shape, thesame annular structure of the denser parts of itsintegument, the same arrangements of longitudinaland oblique muscles connecting these rings,the same apparatus of short feet, with claws, orbristles, or tufts of hairs, for facilitating progression; in short, all the circumstances mostcharacteristic of the vermiform type are equallyexemplified in the different tribes of caterpillars,as in the proper Annelida.But these vermiform insects have this peculiarity,that they contain in their interior the rudimentsof all the organs of the perfect insect.These organs, however, are concealed from viewvol. i. x300 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.by a great number of membraneous coverings,which successively invest one another, like thecoats of an onion, and are thrown off, one afteranother, as the internal parts are gradually developed.These external investments, whichhide the real form of the future animal, havebeen compared to a mask ; so that the insect,while wearing this disguise, has been termedlarva, which is the Latin name for a mask.This operose mode of development is renderednecessary in consequence of the greatercompactness of the integuments of insects, ascompared with those of the angelica. In proportionas they acquire density, they are lesscapable of being further stretched, and at lengtharrive at the limit of their possible growth. Thenit is that they obstruct the dilatation of the internalorgans, and must be thrown off to makeway for the farther growth of the insect. In themean time a new skin has been preparing underneath,moulded on a larger model, and admittingof greater extension than the one which precededit. This new skin, at first, readily yields to thedistending force from within, and a new impulseis given to the powers of development : until,becoming itself too rigid to be further stretched,it must, in its turn, be cast off in order to giveplace to another skin. Such is the processwhich is repeated periodically, for a great numberof times, before the larva has attained its full size.DEVELOPEMENT OF Insects 307These successive peelings of the skin are butso many steps in preparation for a more importantchange. A time comes when the whole ofthe coverings of the body are at once cast off,and the insect assumes the form of a pupa, orchrysalis ; being wrapt as in a shroud, presentingno appearance of external members, and retainingbut feeble indications of life. In thiscondition it remains for a certain period : its internalsystem continuing in secret the fartherconsolidation of the organs ; until the periodarrives when it is qualified to emerge into theworld, by bursting asunder the fetters which hadconfined it, and to commence a new career ofexistence. The worm, which so lately crawledwith a slow and tedious pace along the surfaceof the ground, now ranks among the sportiveinhabitants of air ; and expanding its newly acquiredwings, launches forward into the elementon which its powers can be freely exerted, andwhich is to waft it to the objects of its gratification,and to new scenes of pleasure and delight.Thus do the earlier stages of the developmentof insects exhibit a recurrence of those structureswhich are found in the lowest department of thisseries of animals. The larva, or infantile stageof the life of an insect, is, in all its mechanicalrelations, a mere worm. The imago, or perfectstate, on the other hand, exhibits strong analogieswith the crustaceous tribes, not only in the308 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.general form of the body, but also in the consolidatedtexture of its organs, (especially of thosewhich compose its skeleton) and in the possessionof rigid levers, shaped into articulated limbs,and furnished with large and powerful muscles,from all which circumstances great freedom andextent of motion are derived. To this elaborateframe, nature has added wings, those refinedinstruments of a higher order of movements,subservient to a more expanded range of existence,and entitling the beings on which theyhave been conferred to the most elevated rankamong the lesser inhabitants of the globe.The mechanical functions of insects scarcelyadmit of being reduced to general principles, inconsequenceof the great diversity of forms, ofhabits and of actions, that is met with among theinnumerable host of beings which rank underthis widely extended department of the animalcreation. In these minute creatures may bediscovered all the mechanical instruments andapparatus required for the execution of thosevaried motions which we witness in the largeranimals, and which, though almost peculiar to thedifferent classes of these animals, are here frequentlyunited in the same individual. Insectsswim, dive, creep, walk, run, leap, or fly with asmuch facility as fishes, reptiles, quadrupeds, orbirds. But besides these, a great number havealso movements peculiar to themselves, and ofPROGRESSIVE MOTION IN INSECTS. 309which we meet with no example in other partsof the animal kingdom.In attempting to delineate a sketch of themovements of insects, and of the mechanism bywhich they are performed, I am compelled, bythe great extent of the subject, to confine myselfto very general views ; and must refer such ofmy readers as are desirous of fuller informationon this subject to the works of professed entomologists.The mechanical conditions of an insect in itsseveral states of larva, pupa, and imago, are sowidely different, that it will be necessary to considereach separately. In many tribes, however,the difference between the larva and the perfectinsect is much less considerable than in others.Those belonging to the orders of Hemiptera andOrthoptera for example, come out of the eggwith nearly the same form as that which theyhave in the mature state ; excepting that theyare without wings, these organs being added inthe progress of their growth, and constituting,when acquired, their perfect or imago condition.§ 4. Aquatic Larvct.Many insects, which, when fully developed, arethe most perfectly constructed for flying, are,when in the state of larvae, altogether aquatic310 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.animals. Some of them are destitute of feet, orother external instruments of motion, swimmingonly by means of the alternate inflexions of thebody from side to side, in the same manner asthe Nais, and the Leech. Sometimes theseactions are performed by abrupt strokes, givingrise to an irregular zig-zag course : this is thecase with the larva of the gnat, and with manyothers which have no feet. In the structure ofthe larva of the Libellula, or dragon-fly, a singularartifice has been resorted to for giving animpulse to the body, without the help of externalmembers. It is that of the alternate absorptionof water into a cavity in the hinder part of thebody, and its sudden ejection from that cavity, sothat the animal is impelled in a contrary direction,upon the same principle that a rocket risesin the air by the reaction of that fluid. It hasat various times been proposed to apply thepower of steam to the production of an effectexactly similar to that of which Nature here presentsus with so perfect an example, for the purposeof propelling ships, instead of the ordinarymode of steam navigation.Some larvae, such as that of the Stations,collect a bubble of air, which they retain withina tuft of hair at the extremity of the tail, evidentlywith a view of diminishing the specificgravity of the body, and thus giving greaterefficacy to the muscular actions which theyAQUATIC LARVAE. 311employ in their progression through the water.Another use is also made of these tufts of hair ;for by repelling the water, they allow of theinsect's suspending itself from the surface of thefluid in the manner already noticed in givingthe history of the evolutions of the hydra.*The impulse given by the lateral inflexions ofthe body are in many cases assisted by shortlegs ; but the larvae of the Ephemera, thoughfurnished with legs, do not use them for this purpose,and swim simply by the action of the tail .Those of the Dytiscus are furnished with a pairof very long members, projecting to a considerabledistance from the sides, and flattened at theends, to serve as oars. The larvae of the Hydro-philosare also admirably formed for swimming ;and they not only dart forwards with surprisingvelocity, but also turn in all directions with theutmost facility.§ 5. Terrestrial Larvae.The movements of larvae that are not aquaticare perfectly analogous to those of the Annelida,which they much resemble in their outwardform and mechanical structure. The musclesby which the annular segments of the body aremoved, are exceedingly numerous, and beauties179.312 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.fully arranged with reference to the motionsthey are intended to effect. The investigationof the structure of these minute organs has longexercised the talents of the most skilful entomologists,and still offers much that remains to beexplored* The researches of Lyonet, alreadyalluded to, on the anatomy of the larva of theBombyx Cossus* of which he has published anelaborate description, accompanied by admirableengravings, will ever remain a splendidmonument of patience and ingenuity in overcomingthe difficulties which impede this kindof inquiry. In the body and the limbs of thiscaterpillar, Lyonet counted above 4000 separatemuscular bands, all arranged with the mostperfect symmetry, and adapted with wonderfulprecision to the performance of the requiredeffects.In these larvae, as in the simpler forms ofthe Annelida, progression is often accomplishedsolely by the alternate contraction and extensionof the annular segments, aided, in manycases, by short hairs, and frequently, also, bya slimy secretion which exudes from their bodies.Many larvae which are destitute of feet,move onwards by first coiling the body into acircle, making the head and the tail meet, andthen springing forwards by a sudden extensionof the back, producing an effect like the ligniperda. Patricius.TERRESTRIAL LARVAE. 313bending of a bow. By an artifice of the samekind, some larvae contrive to leap to a considerabledistance, by the violent effort which theymake in unfolding the curvatures of their bodies.Some larvae avail themselves of their jaws inorder to fix the head, and drag the rest of thebody towards it. In this manner do the larvaeof the Capricorn beetles advance along the windingpassages which they have themselves excavated,holding by the jaws, and dragging themselvesforwards. These movements are assistedby the resistance afforded by short tubercleswhich project from different parts of the backand under surface of the body ; so that theseinsects advance in the passage by an act similarto that by which a chimney-sweeper, exertingthe powerful pressure of his elbows, shoulders,and knees, manages to climb up a chimney.For the purpose of enabling insects to takestronger hold of the surfaces they pass over, weoften observe them furnished with spines, orhooks, which are moved by appropriate muscles,and they occupy different situations on the body.Modifications without end occur with regard tothese and other external parts subservient, invarious degrees, to progressive motion. Everypossible gradation is also seen between the shorttubercles already mentioned, and the more regularlyformed feet or legs. Those which areregarded as spurious legs, or prolegs, as theyhave been called, occupy an intermediate place314 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.between these two extremes. They consist offleshy and retractile tubercles, and are oftenvery numerous ; while the number of the truelegs, as they are called, is limited to six. Theselast are the representatives of the legs of thefuture perfect insect; for they are attached tothe three first segments of the thorax ; and areformed of those portions articulated to eachother, corresponding to the three principal jointsof the imago. The true legs are generally protectedby horny scales ; but the coverings of theprolegs are wholly membranous. The office ofthese spurious legs is merely to serve as props tosupport the body while the insect is walking,and to prevent its hinder part from trailing onthe ground. They are frequently terminated bysingle or double hooks ; and also by a marginalcoronet of recurved spines. These hooks, orspines, enable the insect to cling firmly tosmooth surfaces; and also to grasp the mostslender twig, which could not have been laidhold of by legs of the usual construction.The speed with which these larvae can advanceis regulated by many circumstances independentlyof the mere possession of legs : forsome caterpillars move slowly, while others canrun very nimbly. The following is the order inwhich the legs are usually moved : namely, theanterior and the posterior leg on the same sideare advanced at the same moment, together withTERRESTRIAL LARVAE. 315the intermediate one on the other side ; and thistakes place alternately on both sides.There is one tribe of caterpillars called Surveyors,or Geometers, (Fig. 148*, a) which walkby first fixing the fore feet, and then doublingthe body into a vertical arch ; this action bringsnp the hind part of the caterpillar, which is furnishedwith prolegs, close to the head. Thehind extremity being then fixed by means ofthe prolegs situated at that part, the body isagain extended into a straight line ; and thisprocess being repeated, the caterpillar advancesby a succession of paces, as if it were measuringthe distance, by converting its body into a pairof compasses. At the same time that they employthis process, they further provide for theirsecurity by spinning a thread, which they fastento different points of the ground as they goalong. *Many other species of caterpillar practise theThe great force exerted by the muscles of many caterpillarsis exemplified by their often fixing themselves to an object,and extending the body to a distance, as if it were a rigidcylinder: this attitude is shown in Fig. 148* b.316 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.same art of spinning fine silken threads, whichespecially assist them in their progression oversmooth surfaces, and also in descending from aheight through the air. The caterpillar of thecabbage butterfly is thus enabled to climb upand down a pane of glass, for which purpose itfixes the threads that it spins in a zig-zag line,forming so many steps of a rope ladder. Thematerial of which these threads are made is aglutinous secretion, which, on being depositedon glass, adheres firmly to it, and very soonacquires consistence and hardness by the actionof the air.Other caterpillars, which feed on trees, andhave often occasion to descend from one branchto another, send out a rope made with the samematerial, which they can prolong indefinitely ;and thus either suspend themselves at pleasurein the air, or let themselves down to the ground.They continue, while walking, to spin a threadas they advance, so that they can always easilyretrace their steps, by gathering up the cluethey have left, and reascend to the height fromwhich they had allowed themselves to drop.STRUCTURE OF INSECTS. 317§ 6. Imago, or Perfect Insect.The process which nature has followed in thedevelopment of the structure of insects, has forits object the gradual hardening and consolidationof texture, and the union and concentrationof organs : for we find that the segments whichwere at a distance from one another in the larva,are approximated in the perfect insect, andoften closely tied together by ligaments : and inother cases, adjoining segments cohere so as toform but a single piece. Thus the number ofseparate parts composing the solid fabric is considerablydiminished. Other segments, again,fold inwardly, forming internal processes, andadding to the extent and complication of theskeleton.The integuments of perfect insects, being designedto be permanent structures, are thickerand more rigid than those of their larvae,and are formed of several layers, in which thecomponent parts of the integuments of the largeranimals may readily be distinguished. Theirrigidity does not, like that of shells, arise fromthe presence of carbonate of lime ; for they containbut a small proportion of this material : andwhatever calcareous ingredient enters into theircomposition is in the form of phosphate of lime.318 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.In external appearance their texture approachesnearer to that of horn than to any other animalproduct : yet in their chemical composition theydiffer from all the usual forms of albuminousmatter. The substance to which they owe theircharacteristic properties is of a very peculiarnature; it has been termed Chine by M. Oder,*and Entomology by M. Lassaigne.f This substanceis found in large quantity in the wingsand elytra of coleopterous insects. It is remarkablefor not liquefying, as horn does, bythe action of heat ; and accordingly the integumentsof insects, even after having been subjectedto a red heat, and reduced to a cinder,are found to retain their original form. {With this substance there is blended a quantityof colouring matter, which has usually a dullbrown or black hue. But the colour of the externalsurface is generally owing to another portionof this matter, which is spread over it like avarnish, and being soluble in alcohol and inether, may be removed by means of these agents.The colours which are displayed by insects, andAnnales de Chimie, torn. 76.f See the work of Straus Durckheim, p. 33.% M. Oder had concluded from his experiments that no nitrogenenters into the composition of this substance. That thisconclusion has been too hastily adopted has been proved by Mr.Children, who, by pursuing another mode of analysis, found thatthe chine of cantharides contains not less than nine or ten percent,of nitrogen. See Zoological Journal, i. Ill — 115.STRUCTURE OF INSECTS. 319which arise from the presence of this latter substance,are often very brilliant, and, as is thecase with many other classes of animals, the intensityof the tints is heightened by the action oflight. The elytra of tropical insects display agorgeous metallic lustre depending on the reflexionof the prismatic colours ; and the samevariegated hues adorn the scales of butterfliesof those regions.Hair grows in various parts of the surface ofinsects. Where the integument is membranousand transparent, these hairs may be distinctlyperceived to originate from enlarged roots, orbulbs, and to pass out through apertures in theskin ; as is the case with the hair of the largeranimals. Their chemical composition, however,is very different, for they are formed of the samesubstance as the integuments, namely entomology.The purposes served by the hairs are notalways obvious. In many cases they seem intendedto protect the integuments from the water,which they repel from their surfaces. They alsotend to prevent injury arising from friction ; andare found to be more abundant in those parts, asthe joints, which are liable to rub much againstone another.The divisions of the body are frequentlymarked by deep incisions ; whence has originatedthe term insect, expressive of this separationinto sections. It is, however, a character whichTHE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS,they possess in common with all articulated animals,the typical form of which consists, as wehave seen, of a series of rings, or segments,joined endwise in the direction of a longitudinalaxis. The principal portions into whichthe body is divided arethe head, the trunk, andthe abdomen: each ofwhich is composed ofseveral segments. Ihave here given, in illustration,the annexedfigures, showing thesuccessive portions intowhich the solid framework,or skeleton, ofone of the beetle tribe,the Calosoma sycophants* may be separated.The entire insect, which presents the most perfectspecimen of a complete skeleton in this classof animals, is represented in Fig. 1 49 ; and theseveral detached segments, on an enlarged scale,in Fig. 150. The head c, as seen in the latterfigure, may be regarded as being composed ofthree segments; the trunk, x, y, z, of three; andthe abdomen, b, of nine.

Its size, as comparedwith the rest of the body, varies much inVOL. I. Y322 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.different insects, and is in general proportion ablylarger than it is in the larva state. Its integument,which, from analogy with vertebrated animals,has been called the skull, or cranium,(c, Fig, 150), is usually the hardest part of thegeneral crust. Although it may appear, a onsuperficial examination, to consist of a single undividedpiece, yet, on tracing its gradual formation,it is found to be in reality composed of aunion of several of the segments of the larva.Audouin and Carus distinguish three componentsegments in the cranium of insects ; while StrausDurckheim considers it as formed by the consolidationof no less than six segments of thevermiform larva. According to this theory, thesame elements which in the thoracic segmentsare developed into feet, are here employed toform parts having other destinations. From thesegment adjacent to the thorax the antennae aresupposed to be developed. The two anteriorsegments belong properly to the face ; the onegiving origin to the mandibles (m), to themaxillae, or proper jaws, (j), and also to the palpi(p) ; the other producing the processes called thelabial palpi (l).The mode in which the head is connected withthe trunk varies much in different insects.Sometimes it is united by a broad basis of attachment,forming a joint between the adjacentsurfaces : but usually it is only appended by aSTRUCTURE OF INSECTS. 323narrow filament, or neck ; so that the articulationis effected by ligament alone. Occasionally itis placed at the end of a long pedicle, whichremoves it to a considerable distance from thetrunk. In the Hymenoptera and Altera, thehead moves upon a pivot, so as to admit of itsbeing turned completely round.The trunk, or Thorax, is composed, as shownin the figure, of three segments, termed respectivelythe Prothorax (x) ; the Mesothorax (y) ;and the Metathorax (z).* The first of these, theprothorax, carries the first pair of legs; thesecond, or mesothorax, gives origin to thesecond pair of legs, and also to the first pair ofwings, or to the Elytra (e), as in the examplebefore us ; and the third, or metathorax, supportsthe third pair of legs, and the second pair ofwings (w). These two last segments are closelyunited together, but the original distinctioninto two portions is marked by a transverse line.Each of these three segments is divisible into anupper, a lower, and two lateral portions, whichIn these denominations I have followed the nomenclature ofVictor Audouin (Annates des Sciences Naturelles, torn. i. p. 119),as being the simplest and the clearest : but other entomologistshave applied the same terms to different parts. The first segmentis termed by Straus Durckheim and other French writers,the Corselet. Mr. Kirby calls it the Manitrunk, and restrictsthe term Prothorax to its upper portion. The united second andthird segments are the Thorax of Straus Durckheim, the Troncallege of Chabrier. and the Alitrunk of Kirby.324 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.are joined together at the sides of the trunk ;these again admit of further subdivision ; but forthe names and descriptions of these smallerpieces I must refer the reader to works on Entomology.The parts of the thorax to which thewings are attached indicate the situation of thecentre of gravity of the whole insect ; a point,which being in the line of the resultant of all theforces concerned in the great movements of thebody, requires to be sustained by the movingpowers under all circumstances either of actionor repose.Victor Audouin, who has made extensive researcheson the comparative forms of all theseparts in a great variety of insects, appears to havesatisfactorily established the general propositionthat, amidst the endless diversity of forms exhibitedby the skeleton of insects, they are invariablycomposed of the same number of elements,disposed in the same relative situations and orderof arrangement : and that the only source of differenceis a variation in the proportional developmentof these elements. He has also observedthat the great expansion of one part isgenerally attended by a corresponding diminutionof others.The third division of the body is termed theAbdomen (b) ; it is composed of all the remainingsegments, which join to form a cavity enclosingSTRUCTURE OF INSECTS. 325the viscera subservient to nutrition, respiration,and reproduction. The number of these abdominalsegments is very various in different generaof insects. Sometimes there appear to bebut three or four ; while, in other cases, thereare twelve, or even a greater number. In theCalosoma (Fig. 150, b), the abdomen has sixcomplete, followed by three imperfect segments.Not being intended to carry any of the organsof progressive motion, they retain the form ofsimple hoops, which is the primitive type ofthe segments of annulose animals. Each segmenthas a ligamentous connexion with the next,which is often so close, as hardly to admit of anymotion between them; but in other instances itis more lax, and allows of the abdomen beingflexible. In the former case, which is the constructionin all the Coleoptera, or beetles, therings have an imbricated arrangement; that is,each overlaps the next, often to the extent oftwo-thirds of its breadth : so that they present asuccession of spheroidal hoops, capable of beingdrawn out, to a certain extent, like the tubes ofa telescope. This very artificial construction ismanifestly designed to allow of a great variety ofmovements, determined by the position of themuscles they enclose : for since the surfaceswhich receive, as well as those which are received,are segments of spheroids, this structure326 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.admits of a twisting motion; and the latter segmentmay be pushed more or less into the cavityof the former, either generally, or on one side.Each segment, besides being separate fromthe rest, is further divided into an upper, ordorsal, and a lower, or ventral portion ; eachportion having the form of a semicircle, or ratherof an arch of a circle. These are connected atthe sides by a ligamentous band, which runs thewhole length of the abdomen. Great advantageresults from this division of the circles, allowingof the upper and lower portions of the abdominalcovering being at one time separated, and atanother brought nearer together ; for thus thecavity is capable of being enlarged or contractedin its dimensions, and adapted to the variablebulk of its contents. It is deserving of noticethat, during the process of transformation, someof the abdominal segments, which are presentin the larva, disappear entirely, or leave onlyimperfect traces of their former existence.Sometimes the posterior segments become soexceedingly contracted in their diameter as togive rise to the appearance of a tail : this isexemplified in the Panorama.The junction of the abdomen with the trunkis effected in various ways. In all the Coleoptera,it is united by the whole margin of its base,without having a narrower part : in other tribesthere is a visible diminution of diameter, formingSTRUCTURE OF INSECTS. 327a groove all round, or an incision, as it is technicallytermed. In the Hymenoptera, this incisionis so deep as to leave only a narrow pedicle,like a neck, connecting these two divisions ofthe body. In some this pedicle is short, inothers long : in the former case, an exceedinglyrefined mechanism is resorted to for effectingthe necessary movements in a part so bulkycompared with the narrowness of the surface ofattachment.*Insects in their perfect state have constantlysix legs, which are the developements of the sixproper legs of the same animal in its larva condition: all the spurious legs having disappearedduring its metamorphosis. We have seen thatin the myriapoda, the result of development isan increase in the number both of segments andof legs ; the reason of which is that, being terrestrialanimals, a lengthened form was more usefuland accordant with their destination ; bat inwinged insects, where the object is to procurethe means of flight, the organs require to be concentrated,and all superfluous parts must be retrenchedand discarded from the fabric. Themultiplication of organs, which, in the formercase, indicated the progress of a higher development,would in the latter have been the sourceFor the details of this structure I must refer to writers onentomology, and in particular to Kirby and Spence's "Introductionto Entomology," vol. iii. p. 701.328 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.of imperfection. As long as the insect remainsin its larva stage, its condition is analogous tothat of the myriapode : but in the more elevatedstate of its existence, its structure is subject tonew conditions and regulated by new laws.While the number of members is thus reduced,ample compensation is given by their increasedactivity and power, derived from their augmentedlength, and the more distinct lever-like forms ofthe pieces which compose them.These pieces (see Fig. 150) are named, fromtheir supposed analogy to the divisions of thelimbs of the higher orders of vertebrated animals,the haunch (h), the trochanter (t), the femur(f), the tibia (s), and the tarsus (r). In generalthe femur (or thigh) has nearly a horizontal, andthe tibia (or leg) a vertical position, while thewhole tarsus (or foot) is applied to the ground.The haunch (h), which is supposed to correspondto the hip bone of quadrupeds, is a broad,but very short truncated cone. The mode of itsarticulation with the trunk admits of great variety ;sometimes it is united by a ball and socket joint,as in the Curculio and Cerambyx ; and it thenhas, of course, great freedom of motion : at othertimes the joint is of the hinge kind, as in theMelolontha. The trochanter (t), and the femur(f), though in reality distinct pieces, are usuallyso firmly united as to compose only one divisionof the limb. The articulation of this portionSTRUCTURE OF INSECTS. 329with the haunch is always effected by a hinge-joint.Joints of this description, when formed,as they are in insects, by the apposition of twotubular pieces, are constructed in the followingmanner. One of the tubes has, at the end to bearticulated, two tubercles, which project fromthe margin, and are applied to the adjacent endof the other tube at two opposite points of itscircumference ; the line which passes throughthose two points being the axis of motion. Onthe side where the flexion is intended to bemade both tubes are deeply notched, in order toadmit of their being bent upon one another at avery acute angle : and the space left by thesenotches is filled up by a pliant membrane, whichperforms the office of a ligament. These articulartubercles and depressions are so adjusted to oneanother, that the joint cannot be dislocated withoutthe fracture of some of its parts. As thedifferent axes of motion in the successive jointsare not coincident, but inclined at differentangles to one another, the extent of motion inthe whole limb is very greatly increased.Thus in the cases where the articulation of thehaunch with the trunk is a hinge joint, theaxes of this joint and of the next are placedat right angles to each other; so that thereresults, from the combination of both, a capabilityin the thigh of executing a circular motionin a manner almost as perfect as if it had330 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.revolved in a spherical socket. The principle ofthis compound motion is the same as that employedon ship-board for the mariner's compass,and other instruments which require to be keptsteady during the motion of the ship. For thispurpose what are called gambols are used, theparts of which have two axes of rotation, at rightangles to each other, so as to enable the compassto take its proper horizontal position, independentlyof any inclination of the ship.The tibia, or shank (s), is joined at an acuteangle with the femur ; and is frequently eitherbeset with spines, or else notched or serrated.The tarsus, or foot (u), is the last division ofthe limb : it is divided into several joints,which have been supposed to represent thoseof the toes of quadrupeds. The joints aregenerally of the hinge kind, but some are metwith of a more rounded form, and approachingto that of the ball and socket. The wholestructure is most admirably adapted to its exactapplication over all the inequalities of the surfaceson which the insect treads. But as thehabits and modes of life of this numerous classare exceedingly diversified, so the form of thefeet admits of greater variety than that of anyother part of the limb.The feet of insects diverge, and spread over awide surface ; thus extending the base of supportso as to ensure the stability of their bodiesSTRUCTURE OF INSECTS. 331in the most perfect manner. When the legs arevery long, as in the Tipula* the body seems,indeed, more to be suspended than supported bythem ; contrary to what obtains in quadrupeds,where the feet are more immediately underneaththe points at which they are connected with thetrunk.The last joint of the tarsus is generally terminatedby a claw, which is sometimes singleand sometimes double, and which contributes tofasten the foot, under a variety of circumstances,both of action and of repose. With feet thusarmed the insect can ascend or descend theperpendicular sides of a rough body with thegreatest ease ; but it is scarcely able to advancea single step upon glass, or other polished surfaces,even when horizontal. The hooks at theends of the anterior pair of feet are directedbackwards, those of the middle pair inwards,and of the posterior pair forwards ; thus affordingthe greatest possible security against displacement.Many insects are provided with cushions atthe extremity of the feet, evidently for the purposeof breaking the force of falls, and preventingthe jar which the frame would otherwisehave to sustain. These cushions are formed ofIt has been conjectured that the object in furnishing thisinsect with legs of so great a length is that of enabling it towalk among blades of grass.332 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.dense velvety tufts of hair, lining the undersideof the tarsi, but leaving the claw uncovered ; andthe filaments, by insinuating themselves amongthe irregularities of the surfaces to which theyare applied, produce a considerable degree ofadhesion. Cushions are met with chiefly in largeinsects which suddenly alight on the groundafter having leaped from a considerable height :in the smaller species they appear to be unnecessary,because the lightness of their bodiessufficiently secures them from any danger arisingfrom falls.Some insects are furnished with a still morerefined and effectual apparatus for adhesion, andone which even enables them to suspend themselvesin an inverted position from the undersurfaces of bodies. It consists of suckers, thearrangement and construction of which are exceedinglybeautiful ; and of which the commonhouse-fly presents us with an example. In thisinsect that part of the last joint of the tarsuswhich is immediately under the root of the claw,has two suckers appended to it by a narrowfunnel-shaped neck, moveable by muscles in alldirections. These suckers are shown in Fig.152, which represents the under side of the footof Musca victoria, or blue-bottle fly, with thesuckers expanded. The sucking part of theapparatus consists of a membrane, capable ofcontraction and extension, and the edges ofSTRUCTURE OF INSECTS,which are serrated, so as to fit them for theclosest application to any kind of surface. Inthe Tabanus, or horse-fly, each foot is furnishedwith three suckers. In the Cimex lutea, oryellow saw-fly, there are four, of which one isplaced upon the under surface of each of thefour first joints of the toes (Fig. 153) ; and allthe six feet are provided with these suckers.In the Dytiscus marginalise suckers are furnishedto the feet of the male insect only. Thethree first joints of the feet of the fore-legs ofthat insect have the form of a shield, the undersurface of which is covered with suckers havinglong tubular necks ; there is one of these suckersvery large, another of a smaller size, and agreat number of others exceedingly small. Afew of the latter kind are represented highlymagnified in Fig. 154. In the second pair offeet, the corresponding joints are proportionallymuch narrower, and are covered on their undersurface with a multitude of very minute suckers.The Acridium biguttulum, which is a species ofgrasshopper, has one large oval sucker, under334 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.the last joint of the foot, immediately betweenthe claws. On the under surface of the firstjoint are three pair of globular cushions, andanother pair under the second joint. Fig. 155shows these parts. The cushions are filledwith an elastic fibrous substance ; which, inorder to increase the elasticity of the wholestructure, is looser in its texture towards thecircumference. *The mode in which these suckers operatemay be distinctly seen, by observing with amagnifying glass the actions of a large bluebottlefly in the inside of a glass tumbler. Afly will, by the application of this apparatus,remain suspended from the ceiling for anylength of time without the least exertion ; forthe weight of the body pulling against thesuckers serves but to strengthen their adhesion :hence we find flies preferring the ceiling to thefloor, as a place of rest.Insects which, like the gnat, walk much uponthe surface of water, have at the ends of their feeta brush of fine hair, the dry points of whichappear to repel the fluid, and prevent the legfrom being wetted. If these brushes be moistenedwith spirit of wine, this apparent repulsionno longer takes place ; and the insect immediatelysinks and is drowned.Philosophical Transactions for 1826, p. 324.STRUCTURE OV INSECTS. 335§ 7. Aquatic Insects.Although many insects are inhabitants of waterwhile in their larva state, few continue to residein that element after they have undergone alltheir metamorphoses. When they have attainedthe imago state, indeed, every part of their bodiesbecomes permeated by air, which forms altogethera large portion of their bulk, and givesto the insect, when it is immersed in water, astrong buoyant force. As the largest volume ofair is contained in the abdomen, this part iscomparatively lighter than either the trunk orhead ; and the natural position of the insect inthe fluid is oblique to the horizon, the headbeing depressed, and the abdomen elevated.Any force impelling the body forwards in thedirection of its axis tends, therefore, to make italso descend. The effect of this downward forceis counteracted by the sustaining pressure of thewater, which is directed vertically upwards : sothat the real operation of the force in question isto carry the body forwards nearly in a horizontaldirection.In insects destined to move in water, sometimesall the legs, but occasionally only onepair, are lengthened and expanded into broadtriangular surfaces, capable of acting as oars :336 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.and these surfaces are further extended by theaddition of marginal fringes of hair, so disposedas to project and act upon the water everytime the impulse is given, but to bend downwhen the leg is again drawn up, preparatory tothe succeeding stroke ; thus imitating the actionwhich is called feathering an oar. The impulsesare given with great regularity, all the feetstriking the water at the same moment.Of all the coleopterous insects, the Dytiscus,or water-beetle (of which Fig. 156 representsthe upper, and Fig. 157 the under side), is theone best constructed for swimming : its bodyhaving a flattened form, very much resemblinga boat, narrower before than behind, and itssurface presenting no projecting parts. Theupper surface in particular is extremely smooth,to enable it to glide under the water with theleast possible friction. Its centre of gravity isplaced very near the under surface. The posteriorlegs, which act as powerful oars, are attachedAQUATIC INSECTS. 337to very large haunches, for the purpose of containingthe thick muscular bands which are insertedinto the trochanter, and by which thesejoints are moved with great power. As themotion of these oars is to be performed in aplane nearly parallel to the axis of the body,the haunches are not required to be moveable :and accordingly they are firmly united to thethorax ; a structure which renders the motion ofthe other joints more regular and uniform. Whenthe Dytiscus wishes to rise, it need only desistfrom all action, and abandon itself to the buoyantforce of the fluid, which quickly carries it to thesurface.The Notonecta, or water-boatman (Fig. 158),is remarkable for always swimming on its back,a peculiarity depending onthe form of its body, which issemi cylindrical, with the legsaffixed to the flat surface ; sothat, when lying on its backin the fluid, the centre of gravity is below thecentre of the whole figure, or the metacentre, asit is termed, and the equilibrium is maintained.It is evident that, under these circumstances, ifit were placed in the water with its legs undermost,it would unavoidably tilt over, and resumeits usual position. Its long legs extending atright angles to the body, present a striking re-vol.i. z338 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.semblance to the oars of a boat ; and they act,indeed, in the same manner, and on the sameprinciples.§ 8. Progressive Motion of Insects on Land.The actions of the limbs of insects in walkingare quite different from what they are in swimming,and are very similar to those of the caterpillar,in which we have seen that the motions ofthe anterior and posterior legs on one side arecombined with that of the middle one on theother side ; and the two sets of legs are movedalternately. In consequence of their relativepositions with the trunk, the anterior legs areadvanced by the extension, and the posteriorlegs by the flexion of the corresponding joints.When the feet have fixed themselves on theground, the contrary actions take place, and thebody is brought forwards. During this periodthe legs which compose the other set are calledinto play, and are advanced ; and the samesuccession of actions takes place with these aswith the former. This can easily be seen whenthe insect walks very leisurely ; but in a morequickened pace, the succession of actions is toorapid to be followed by the eye.The action of leaping is performed by thePROGRESSIVE MOTION OF INSECTS. 339sudden extension of all the joints of the limb,which are previously folded as close as possible.The joints principally concerned in this action,are those of the thigh and tibia, as they furnishthe longest and most powerful levers. Preparatoryto the effort, the tibia is brought down asclose as possible to the ground, by bending itover the tarsus ; and the thigh also is bent uponthe tibia, so as to form with it a very acuteangle. In order to enable it to take this positionwith most advantage, we find in many ofthe Coleoptera, that the thigh has a longitudinalgroove for the reception of the tibia, with a rowof spines on each side of the groove. While thelimb is in this bent position, the extensor musclesare violently exerted, and by producing a suddenunbending of this apparatus of folded springs,they project the whole body, by the accumulatedimpulse, to a considerable height in theair. The leaps of insects being generally forwards,all the legs do not participate equally inthe effect ; for the fore legs contribute muchless to it than the hind legs, and are more usefulin modifying the direction of the leap, than inadding to its force. The power of leaping isderived principally from the great size andstrength of the extensor muscles of the legs,which, being contained within the femur, necessarilyswell that division of the limb to an340 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.unusual thickness; and in order to procuresufficient velocity of action, both the femur andtibia are much elongated. Thus the locust, whichis so constructed, leaps with ease to a distancetwo hundred times the length of its own body.We may in general, indeed, infer the particularkind of progressive motion for which the insectis intended by observing the comparative lengthof the different pairs of legs. When they areof equal size, the pace is uniform : — swiftest inthose that have the longest legs, — slowest whenthey are short. When the anterior legs aremuch longer than the posterior, the power ofprehension may be increased, but that of progressionis impeded. The great prolongation ofthe posterior legs is generally accompanied bythe power of jumping, unless, indeed, they areat the same time much bent, for such curvaturedisqualifies them from acting advantageously aslevers.Many insects have the extremity of the tibiaarmed with a coronet of spines, which assist infixingthis point against the plane from whichthey intend to spring, and which give to thelimb a steady fulcrum. The Cicada samariahas been known to leap to a distance of five orsix feet ; which is two hundred and fifty timesits own length : this, if the same proportionswere observed, is equivalent to a man of ordinarystature vaulting through the air the length of aPROGRESSIVE MOTION OF INSECTS. 341quarter of a mile. When the same insect is laidon glass, on which the spines cannot fasten, it isunable to leap farther than six inches.*The insects belonging to the genus Elaterare provided with a peculiar mechanism for thespecial purpose of accomplishing a singularmode of leaping, independently of any actionof the legs. The legs of this insect are so short,that when it is laid on its back, it cannot turnitself, being unable to reach with its feet theplane on which it is lying, and procure a fulcrumfor the action of its muscles. It is apparentlywith the design of remedying this inconvenience,that nature has bestowed on this tribe of insectsthe faculty of springing into the air, and makinga somerset, so as to light upon the feet ; an effectwhich is accomplished by an exceedingly curiousmechanism. The prothorax is prolonged beyondthe length it usually has in other cleopatra, andit is articulated with the mesothorax on the dorsalside by two lateral tubercles, which form a hingejoint, limiting its motions to a vertical plane.The sternum, or pectoral portion of the prothoraxis also extended backwards, and terminates inan elastic spine, which is received into a cavityin the mesothorax, and which, while the insectis lying on its back, with the prothorax bentupon the mesothorax, recoils with the force ofDe Beer, III. 178, quoted by Kirby and Spence,342 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.a spring, and communicates to the body animpulse which carries it upwards to a considerableheight. If the elater should fail in itsfirst attempts to recover its feet, it repeats itsleaps till it succeeds. We find no example of asimilar structure in any other part of the animalkingdom.The express adaptation of structure to themode of life designed for each species of insectis nowhere more strongly marked than in thosewhich are intended to burrow in the earth : and ofthese the Gryllo-talpa> or mole cricket, presentsa remarkable example. A minute account of theanatomy of this insect has been given by Dr.Kidd,* from which it appears that being destined,like the mole, to live beneath the surfaceof the earth, and to excavate for itself a passagethrough the soil, it is furnished with limbs peculiarlycalculated for burrowing, with a skinwhich, being covered with a fine down, effectuallyprevents the adhesion of the moist earththrough which it moves ; and with a form ofbody enabling it to penetrate with least resistancethe opposing medium. By being endowedwith the power of moving as easily in abackward as in a forward direction, it is enabledquickly to retreat in the narrow channel it hasexcavated : and as a safeguard in these retroPhil. Trans, for 1825, p. 203.PROGRESSIVE MOTION OF INSECTS. 343grade movements, it is provided with a pair ofposterior appendages, which are supplied withlarge nerves, and may be regarded as servingthe purpose of caudal antennae.The fore-legs, (one of which is represented inFig. 158*) are the burrowing implements, andthey are admirably calculatedfor their peculiaroffice, both in theshape and in the modeof articulation of theirseveral divisions, which bear a considerable analogyto the corresponding member of the mole.Dr. Kidd observes, that, compared with theother legs, and with the general size of theanimal, they are as if the brawny hand andarm of a robust dwarf were set on the body ofa delicate infant ; and the indications of strengthwhich their structure manifests, fully answer totheir extraordinary size. For a more particulardescription of the mechanism of this instrumentI must refer the reader to the paper abovequoted.344 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.§ 9. Flight of Insects.If the excellence of a mechanic art be measuredby the difficulties to be surmounted in theattainment of its object, none surely would rankhigher than that which has accomplished theflight of a living animal. No human skill hasyet contrived the construction of an automaton,capable, by the operation of an internal force, ofsustaining itself in the air, in opposition to gravity,for even a few minutes ; and far less ofperforming in that element the evolutions whichwe daily witness even in the lowest of the insecttribes. To the ultimate attainment of this facultyit would appear that all the transformationsthey undergo in external appearance, andall the developements of their internal mechanism,are expressly directed. Wings areadded to the frame only in the last stage of itscompletion ; after it has disencumbered itself ofevery ponderous material that could be spared,after it has been condensed into a small compass,and after it has been perforated in alldirections by air-tubes, giving lightness andbuoyancy to every part. Curiously folded upin the pupa, the wings there attain their fulldimensions, ready to expand whenever the bandagesthat surround them are removed. NoFLIGHT OF INSECTS. 345sooner is the insect emancipated from its confinement,than these organs, which are composedof duplicates of a dense, but exceedinglyfine membrane, identical in its composition withthe general integuments, begin to separate fromthe sides of the body, and to unfold all theirparts. Their moisture rapidly evaporates, leavingthe delicate film dry and firm, so as to beready for immediate action. The fibres, orjiervures, as they are called, form a delicatenet work, for the support of this fine membrane,like the frame of the arms of a windmill, whichsupports the canvass spread over them. Themicroscope shows that these fibres are tubular,and contain air ; a structure the most effectualfor conjoining lightness with strength ; and manyentomologists are of opinion that the insect hasthe power, during the act of flying, of directingair into the nervures, so as to dilate them to theutmost, and render them quite tense and rigid.In the great majority of insects the wings arefour in number ; of which the first pair are, aswe have seen, affixed to the mesothorax, and thesecond to the metathorax. These two segmentsof the thorax, composing what has been termedthe alitrunk, constitute the most solid portion ofthe skeleton, and are frequently strengthened byridges, and other mechanical contrivances forsupport. The superior extremities of these supports,which have been compared to the clavicles,346 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.or circular bones of birds, are always curved inwards.This part of the trunk requires to bealternately dilated and contracted during flight,and hence the several pieces of which its dorsalportion is composed are loosely connected togetherby ligaments.*The shape of the wings is more or less triangular.They are moved by numerous muscles,which occupy a large space in the interior ofthe trunk, and consist of various kinds offlexors, extensors, retractors, levator, and depresses; the whole forming a very complicatedassemblage of moving powers. The largest,and consequently most powerful of these muscles,are those which depress, or bring down thewings. They form a large mass, marked a inFig. 144. All these muscles exert great force intheir contractions, which are capable of beingrenewed in very rapid succession : for, indeed,unless they had this power, even so light abody as that of an insect could not have beensustained for a moment in so rare a medium asthe atmosphere, far less raised to any height byits resistance.The simple ascent and descent of the wingswould be sufficient, without any other movementbeing imparted to them, to carry forwards theSee Chabrier's " Essai sur le Vol des Insectes," Memoiresdu Museum histoire Naturelle ; vi. 410, vii. 297, and viii. 47and 349.

The action inwhich the muscles exert the greatest force is instriking the air during the descent of the wing .an impulse in the opposite direction being theresult of the reaction of the air. The axis ofmotion of the wings is a line inclined at a smallangle to the axis of the body, and directed frombefore backwards, outwards, and downwards ;and they move in a plane, which is not vertical,but inclined forwards. The angle which theplane of the wing forms with the horizon variescontinually in the different positions of the wing,but the general resultant of all these successiveimpulses is a force directed forwards andupwards ; the first part of this force producesthe horizontal progression of the insect, whilethe second operates in counteracting the forceof gravity, and during the advance of the insect,either maintains it at the same height, orenables it to ascend.When the insect wishes to turn, or to pursuean oblique course, it effects its purpose veryeasily by striking the air with more force on oneside than on the other ; or, by employing certainmuscles which bend the body to one side, itshifts the situation of the centre of gravity, sothat the reaction of the air on the wings isexerted in a different direction to what it wasbefore ; and the motion of the body is modifiedaccordingly.348 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.By exerting a force with the wings just sufficientto balance that of gravity, insects canpoise themselves in the air, and hover for alength of time over the same spot, without risingor falling, advancing or retreating ; and the bodymay, all the while, be kept either in the horizontal,or in the erect position. In the latter casethe motions are similar to those which take placein ordinary flying, only they are more feeblyexerted, since all that is required is to sustainthe weight of the body without urging it to agreater speed. Libelled, Sphinxes, and a greatnumber of Diptera, exhibit this kind of action :among the latter the Stations is most remarkablefor its power of remaining long in the samefixed position.The number, form, and structure of the wingshave furnished entomologists with very convenientcharacters for their classification : on theseare founded the orders of the Coleoptera, Ortiiop-tera, Rhipiptera, Rhipiptera, Neuroptera, Hymenoptera,Diptera, and Lepidoptera. To enterinto any detail in a field of such vast extent as ispresented by the infinitely diversified mechanismof the insect creation, would, it is obvious, farexceed the proper limits of this treatise. I musttherefore confine myself to a few leading pointsin their structure and modes of progression.In the Coleoptera, an order which comprehendsFLIGHT OF INSECTS. 349by far the largest number of genera of insects,the lower pair of wings (w, Fig. 150, p. 321)are light and membranous, and of a textureexceedingly fine and delicate. They are of greatextent compared with the size of the body, whenfully expanded : and are curiously folded whennot in use. For the protection of these delicateorgans, the parts which correspond to the upperpair of wings of other insects, are here convertedinto thick opaque, and hard plates (e), adaptedto cover the folded membranous wings when theinsect is not flying, and thus securing them frominjurious impressions to which they might otherwisebe exposed from heat, moisture, or thecontact of external bodies. These wing cases,or elytra as they are termed, are never themselvesemployed as wings, but remain raised and motionlessduring the flight of the insect. They probably,however, contribute to direct the courseof flight, by variously modifying the resistanceof the air.*In the Orthoptera, (Fig. 159), the coverings ofthe wings, or tegmina, instead of being of ahorny texture, are soft and flexible, or semi-membranous.The wings themselves, beingThe Elytra of insects have been regarded by Open as correspondingto the bivalve shells of the Mollusca, a notion whichseems to be founded upon a fanciful and strained analogy.THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.broader than their coverings, are, when not inuse, folded longitudinally, like a fan.In the new Order of Rhipiptera of Latreille,*which includes only two genera, the tegmina areanomalous both in their situation and shape ;being fixed at the base of the anterior legs, verylong and narrow, and apparently incapable ofprotecting the wings. The wings themselves areof ample extent, forming, when expanded, aquadrant of a circle, with five or six nervuresradiating from their base, and folded longitudinally.In the Hemiptera, the tegmina, or as theyare here called, the hem-elytra, are coriaceoustowards their base, but membraneous towardsThe Strepsiptera of Kirby. See Transactions of the LinnaeanSociety, XI. 86.FLIGHT OF INSECTS. 351their extremity, and the true wings are foldedtransversely, so as to cross one another. Thesehem-elytra are employed to strike the air inflight, and their movements accompany those ofthe wings.Insects having four thin membranous andtransparent wings are arranged under two orders ;namely, the Neuroptera (Fig. 160), in which thelesser nervures form an interlacement of fibres,crossing one another nearly at right angles, likenet work, or lace : and the Hymenoptera (Fig.161), in which they are disposed like the ramificationsof arteries or veins, diverging at acuteangles from the main trunks. The insects belongingto these two orders enjoy extensive powersof flight. Libellulce, and JEschnce, which are includedin the first of these orders, never close theirwings, but, when they are not flying, keep themconstantly expanded, and ready for instant action.They fly with the greatest ease in all directions,sideways, or backwards, as well as forwards, andcan instantly change their course without beingobliged to turn their bodies. Hence they possessgreat advantages both in chasing other insects,and in evading the pursuit of birds. Bees, whichare hymenopterous insects, have often been observedto fly to great distances from their hivein search of food. The humble bee adopts avery peculiar mode of flight, describing, in itsaerial course, segments of circles, alternately toTHE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.the right and to the left. The velocity withwhich these insects move through the air ingeneral much exceeds that of a bird, if estimatedwith reference to the comparative size of theseanimals.*I have been favoured by Mr. George Newport with the followingaccount of the structure of the sting of the Wild Bee,(Antkophora retusa, Kirby) which he has lately carefully examined,and from whose drawings of the dissected parts theannexed figures (163) have been engraved. " The sting of thebee, a, is formed of two portions placed laterally together, butcapable of being separated. The point, p, is directed a littleupwards, and is a little curved :the barbs, seen still more highlymagnified at q, are about six innumber, and are placed on theunder surface, and their pointsdirected backwards. At thebase of the sting, e, there 'isa semicircular dilatation apparentlyintended to prevent theinstrument from being thrusttoo far out of the sheath (seenseparately at v), in which itmoves: it has also a long tendonto which the muscles areattached. It is between theseplates, when approximated, thatthe poison flows from the orificeof the somewhat dilated extremityof the poison duct, d,which comes from the anteriorpart of the poison bag, b. Thisbag is of an oval shape, andis not the organ which secretesthe poison, but merely a receptacle for containing it: for it isFLIGHT OF INSECTS. 353Although the greater number of insects havefour wings, there are many, such as the commonhouse fly, and the gnat, which have only two.These compose the order Diptera (Fig. 162).In these insects we meet with two organs, consistingof cylindrical filaments, terminated in aclubbed extremity ; one arising from each sideof the thorax (as seen in the above figure), inthe situation in which the second pair of wingsoriginate in those insects that have four wings.They are named the halteres, or powers, fromtheir supposed use in balancing the body, oradjusting with exactness the centre of gravitywhen the insect is flying. Whatever may betheir real utility, they may still be regarded asrudiments of a second pair of wings ; and theyafford, therefore, when thus viewed, a strikinginstance of the operation of the tendency whichconveyed into this bladder by means of a long convolutedvessel, c, which receives it from the secreting organs, s. Theseorgans consist of two somewhat dilated vessels resembling caeca,but which have each a slender secretory vessel extendingfrom them. The sting moves in a tubular sheath, V; which isopen at its base, and along its upper surface, as far as the partwhere the sting is prevented from being thrust out any farther.The muscles which move the sheath are distinct from those ofthe sting, and are attached to an elongated and curved part oneach side of its base, and to an arched and moveable part whichis apparently articulated with it. Swammerdam has delineatedthese parts as caeca in his dissection of the common hive bee, buthas not noticed the secretory vessels. The sting of the hive beeresembles that of the Anthophora retusa"VOL. I. A A354 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.prevails universally in the animal kingdom, andmodifies the structure of each individual partso as to preserve its conformity to one generaltype.The innumerable tribes of butterflies, sphinxes,and moths, are all comprehended in the orderLepidoptera, and are distinguished by havingwings covered with minute plumes, or scales.These scales are attached so slightly to themembrane of the wing as to come off whentouched with the fingers, to which they adherelike fine dust. When examined with the microscope,their construction and arrangementappear to be exceedingly beautiful, beingmarked with parallel and equidistant striae,often crossed by still finer lines, the distinctvisibility of which in many kinds of scales, asthose of Portia brassica, or cabbage butterfly,and the Morphia Menelaus of America, constitutesa good criterion of the excellence of theinstrument. The beautiful colours which thesescales possess may perhaps generally be owingto the presence of some colouring material : butthe more delicate hues are probably the resultof the optical effect of the striae on the surface ;and in some cases they result from the thinnessof the transparent plate of which they consist;for I have observed in several detachedscales that the colours they exhibit by transmittedlight are the complementary colours toFLIGHT OF INSECTS.those which they display when seen by reflectedlight.The forms of these scales are exceedingly diversified,not only in different species, but alsoin different parts of the wings and body of thesame insect ; for the surface of the body, generally,as well as the limbs, and even in some speciesthe antennae are more or less coveredwith these scales.* Fig. 164 exhibits some ofthe more usual shapes as they appear whenviewed with high magnifying powers.Each scale is inserted into the membrane ofthe wing by a short pedicle, or root, and the posthumous work of Lyonet, which has lately appeared,nearly the whole of six quarto plates are crowded withthe delineations of the different forms of the scales found in theBombyx Cossus.356 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.laps the adjoining scales : and the whole aredisposed in rows with more or less regularity ;one row covering the next, like tiles on theroof of a house.* This imbricated arrangement,together with the marks that are left on themembrane of the wing where the scales havebeen rubbed off, are shown in Fig. 165, whichis a faithful delineation of the appearance of thewing of the Hesperia Sloane, seen through apowerful microscope. The membrane of thewing itself, when stripped of its scales, is asperfectly transparent as that of the bee, andis, in like manner, supported by divergingnervures. Many butterflies exhibit in someparts of the wing smooth pearly spots, calledby entomologists, ocelli, or eyes, which arisefrom those parts being naturally destitute ofscales. The number of these scales necessaryto cover the surface of the wings must, fromtheir minuteness, be exceedingly great. Themoth of the silk worm bombyx mori, Fig.148), which has but a small wing, contains,according to Leeuwenhoek, more than two hundredthousand of these scales in each wing.These scales doubtless contribute to the protectionof the wing ; but they at the same timeThe scales on the wing of the Lepisma are of two kinds ;one set being arranged in rows, as usual, and the others, whichare of a different shape, being inserted between and over theformer, so as to fasten each firmly in its place.FLIGHT OF INSECTS. 357add considerably to their weight, and impedethe velocity of their action. This inconvenienceappears to have been in a great measure compensatedby the greater size of the wings, and bythe extent of the surface with which they strikethe air. Still, however, it is sufficiently obviousthat insects of this order fly with less rapidityand steadiness than most others. But this unsteadiness,again, is turned to good account ; forthe butterfly, by its irregular and apparentlycapricious movements, alternately dipping andrising in the air, so as to describe a series of zigzaglines, more easily eludes capture when pursued,not only by naturalists, but also by birdsthat are eagerly seeking to secure them. It isastonishing to what a distance the silk wormmoths will fly : some have been known to travelmore than a hundred miles in a short time. ThePapilio Iris often rises to so great a height inthe air as to be quite invisible.A mechanical contrivance is adopted in manyof the Lepidoptera for keeping their wingssteady during flight, consisting of a hookcovered with hair and scales, attached to theunder side of the upper wings near their base,and connected also by means of bristles to thebase of the lower wing: by this attachment allthe wings are locked together and brought intoaction at the same time. Insects of the Sphinxtribe are also provided with a kind of rudder358 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.formed by the expansion of the tail, enablingthem to steer their course with more certainty.The Lepidoptera in general fly with the bodynearly upright, contrary to the habits of mostother winged insects, whose bodies, while flying,are nearly in a horizontal position.The feats of agility and strength exhibited byinsects have often been the theme of admirationwith writers on natural history ; and have beenconsidered as affording incontrovertible proofs ofthe enormous power with which their musclesmust be endowed. We have already had occasionto notice a remarkable instance of the forceand permanence of muscular contraction in thosecaterpillars which frequently remain for hourstogether in a fixed attitude, with their bodiesextended from a twig, to which they cling bytheir hind feet alone.* Ants will carry loadswhich are forty or fifty times heavier than theirown bodies: and the distances to which manyspecies, such as the Elater, the Locust, theLepisma, and above all the Pulex, are capableof leaping, compared with the size of the insectsthemselves, appear still more astonishing. Linnaeushas computed that the Melolontha, orchaffer, is, in proportion to its bulk, more than sixtimes stronger than the horse : and has assertedthat if the same proportional strength as is pos-seeFig. 148*, p. 315,FLIGHT OF INSECTS. 359sessed by the Lucan, or stag-beetle, had beengiven to the elephant, that animal would havebeen capable of tearing up by the roots thelargest trees, and of hurling huge rocks againsthis assailants, like the giants of ancient mythology.But while we must admit that all these factsindicate a remarkable degree of energy in thecontractile power of the muscular fibres of insects,we should at the same time recollect thatthe diminutive size of the beings which displaythose powers is itself the source of a mechanicaladvantage not possessed by larger animals.The efficacy of all mechanical arrangementsmust ultimately depend on a due proportion betweenthe moving and the resisting forces : hencemechanism of every kind must be adjusted withreference not merely to the relative, but to theabsolute dimensions of the structures themselves.This will be evident when we consider that theforces which are called into action are resistedby the cohesion of the particles composing thesolid parts of the machine : and this cohesion,being not a variable, but a constant and definiteforce, must necessarily limit the dimensions ofevery mechanical structure, whether intendedfor stability or for action. An edifice raisedbeyond a certain magnitude, will not supportitself, because the weight of the materials increasesmore rapidly than the strength. How360 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.often has it been found that a machine whichworks admirably in a small model, will totallyfail in its performance when constructed on alarger scale ? Any lever, of whatever form, maybeincreased in its dimensions until the force ofgravity becomes superior to the cohesion of itsown particles : and consequently any structure,like a vegetable or animal body, composed of acombination of levers, would, if its size were toexceed a certain limit, fall to pieces merely byits own weight. This can be prevented eitherby employing materials of greater cohesivestrength, or by increasing, at the points wherethe strains are greatest, the thickness of theparts compared with their length: but thechoice of materials is necessarily restricted withinnarrow limits, and the latter expedient wouldentirely alter the relative proportions of theparts, and would require a complete changein the plan of their construction. In passingfrom the smaller to the larger animals, we find,accordingly, that new models are adopted, anew order of architecture introduced, and newlaws of development observed. We have,next, then, to direct our attention to the procedureof nature in the execution of this moreenlarged and comprehensive scheme of animalorganization.Chapter VI.VERTEBRATA.§ 1 . Vertebrated Animals in general.If it be pleasing to trace the footsteps of naturein constructions so infinitely varied as those ofthe lower animals, and to follow the gradationsof ascent from the zoophyte to the winged insect,which exhibits the greatest perfection compatiblewith the restricted dimensions of thatclass of beings, still more interesting must be thestudy of those more elaborate efforts of creativepower which are displayed on a wider field in thehigher orders of the animal kingdom. In thevarious tribes of beings which are now to comebefore us, we find nature proceeding to displaymore refined developements in her system of organization,resorting to new models of structureon a scale of greater magnitude than before, devisingnew plans of economy, calculated for moreextended periods of duration, and adopting newarrangements of organs, fitted for the exercise ofa higher order of faculties. The reside of thesemore elaborate constructions is seen in the vastseries of Vertebrated Animals, which comprises362 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.a well-marked division of Zoology, comprehendingall the larger species that exist on the globe,in whatever climate or element they may befound ; and including man himself, placed, as heunquestionably is, at the summit of the scale ; —the undisputed Lord of the Creation.A remarkable affinity of structure prevailsthroughout the whole of this extensive assemblageof beings. Whatever may be the size orexternal form of these animals, whatever theactivity or sluggishness of their movements,whether they be inhabitants of the land, thewaters, or the air, a striking similitude may betraced both in the disposition of their vital organs,and in the construction of the solid framework,or skeleton, which sustains and protects theirfabric. The quadruped, the bird, the tortoise,the serpent, and thdkfish, however they maydiffer in subordinate details of organization, areyet constructed upon one uniform principle, andappear like varied copies from the same originalmodel. In no instance do they present structureswhich are altogether isolated, or can beregarded as the results of separate and independentformations.In proceeding from the contemplation of thestructures of articulated to those of vertebratedanimals, we appear to pass by a rapid excursiveflight, from one great continent to another,separated by an immense gulf, contain-vertebrateANIMALS. 363ing no intermediate islands from which wemight gather indications of these tracts of landhaving been originally connected. At the veryfirst sight indeed, the general fabrics of thesetwo descriptions of animals appear to have beenconstructed upon opposite principles ; for in theone, as we have already seen, the softer parts areinternal, and are enclosed in a solid crust, orshell, or horny covering, answering at once thepurposes of protection and mechanical support,and furnishing extensive surfaces for the attachmentof the organs of motion. But in the Vertebrata,the solid frame work which serves thesepurposes occupies, for the most part, an internalsituation, constituting a true jointed skeleton,which is surrounded by the softer organs, and towhich the muscles, destined to move their severalparts, are attached. The office of external defenceis entrusted solely to the integuments, andtheir different appendages. Such is the generalcharacter of the arrangements which nature hashere adopted ; from which, however, she has occasionallydeviated with respect to some importantorgans of extremely delicate texture, andwhich require to be shielded from the slightestpressure. This occurs with regard to the brain,and the spinal marrow, which we shall presentlyfind are specially guarded by a bonystructure, enclosing them on every side, andforming an impenetrable case for their THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.section. The solid mass of bone, thus providedto defend the brain, gives also the opportunityof lodging safely the delicate apparatus subservientto the finer senses, namely, those of sight,of hearing, and of smell. The security whichthese organs derive from this protection allowsof their being carried to a higher degree of improvementthan could be attained in the lowerorders.There is also another advantage, of considerablemoment, which results from the internalsituation of the skeleton, namely, that it admitsof an indefinite extension by growth, without interferingwith the corresponding enlargement ofthe softer organs ; for we have seen that in all theinstances in which this arrangement is reversed,that is, whenever the enclosing surfaces becomesolid, and can no longer yield to the dilatation ofthe contained organs, no alternative remains butthat of breaking up the exterior case, and whollycasting it off, to make room for the farthergrowth of the animal ; after which operation, ithas to be replaced by another covering of largerdimensions. This operation is generally requiredto be performed a great number of times,before the animal can acquire the size it isdestined to attain. Hence the perpetual mountingof the caterpillar; hence the repeatedcastings of the shells of the Crustacea; andhence also the successive metamorphoses of theSTRUCTURE OF BONE. 365insect. Nothing of this kind takes place amongthe Vertebrata ; where all the organs are developedin regular and harmonious succession,without the slightest mutual interference, andwithout those vicissitudes of action and of torpidity,which we witness in the chequered existenceof the insect.§ 2. Structure and Composition of theOsseous Fabric.The process employed for the formation and extensionof the solid frame work of the Vertebratadiffers totally from that which we haveseen exemplified in the growth of shells, or ofthe hard coverings of insects and of 'crustaceousanimals. These latter structures, and the modesadopted for their increase, are suited only toanimals in which the functions of the economyhave not reached that perfection to which theyare carried in the higher classes. In the moreelaborate system of the vertebrata, the skeletonis composed of true bones; that is, of solid pieces,which, although they are dense calcareous structures,yet continue organized during the wholeperiod of development, and form as much apart of the living system as any other organ ofthe body. We have formerly seen that the366 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.membrane, in which the calcareous matter ofthe shell is deposited, should properly be classedamong the integuments ; being analogous tothem not only in being situated externally, butalso in their structure and in their function. Itis not so with bone, which is essentially aninternal structure.*In their chemical composition, likewise, bonesare strikingly contrasted with the calcareousproducts of the Mollusca : for in the former, theearthy portion consists almost wholly of phosphateof lime : a material which appears to haveDe Blainville regards the hard coverings of insects, togetherwith the shells of the Crustacea, as structures derived altogetherfrom the integuments, and as perfectly analogous, in this respect,to the scales, hoofs, or other horny productions of the skin invertebrated animals. Geoffrey St. Hilaire contends, on the contrary,that the former constitute the true skeleton of the lowerclasses, and that a perfect analogy may be traced between therings, which are the essential constituents of the frame-work ofannulose animals, and the vertebrae, which enclose the spinalcord of the higher classes. Professor Carus appears, in hissystem of organic formations, to have kept in view both theseanalogies ; giving to the former class of structures the denominationof Demo-skeleton, and to the latter that of N euro skeleton(See his Tabula Anatomise Comparative illustrates, editedby Thienemann). Analogies have also been imagined to existbetween the external and internal situations of the woody fibresof plants belonging respectively to the endogenous and exogenousclasses, and that of the corresponding relative situations ofthe skeletons of vertebrates and vertebrated animals. (See aMemoir by Mortier, in the Nova Acta Physic-Medica Acid.Caesar. Leopold. Caroline Nature. Curios. XVI., 219).CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF BONE. 307been selected for this purpose from its formingmuch harder compounds with animal membranethan the carbonate. Wherever great strengthand rigidity are required, this is the materialdepended on for imparting these qualities ; andit has accordingly been employed for the osseousstructures, which are among the most elaborateresults of organization. The densest and hardestof these structures are those in which the proportionof phosphate of lime is the greatest,when compared with that of the animal substancewhich cements them together ; the forceof mutual cohesion among its own particlesbeing much greater than that imparted by thecementing ingredient. The internal bony portionsof the ear, where, in order perfectly totransmit the sonorous vibrations, the greatestsolidity is required, are the densest parts of theskeleton ; and phosphate of lime enters mostlargely into the composition of these bones.The tympanic portions of the temporal bone ofthe whale and the cachalot, where the greatsize of the organ gives us advantages in examiningthem, are as dense and as hard asmarble. The bony portions of the teeth, likewise,afford instances of very hard calcareousformations ; but the enamel, which consistsalmost wholly of phosphate of lime, isharder still, and resembles the siliceous stones,being, like flint, capable of striking fire with368 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.steel. It is scarcely necessary to point out theobvious intentions which are fulfilled by thispeculiarity of structure, conferring extraordinaryhardness on a part of which the appropriate officeis that of breaking down hard bodies subjectedto their mechanical action. But this extremedegree of crystalline hardness would be ill suitedto other parts of the frame. In ordinary bones,absolute rigidity is not the quality which isalone wanted ; for, in general, the hardest bodiesare also the most fragile. An excess of rigidity,therefore, would have been attended with brittleness,and been productive of the worst consequencesto parts exposed to sudden and violentconcussions. It is in order to guard against thisevil that an elastic animal matter is employed asthe basis of the structure, acting as a strongcement interposed between the calcareous particles.This composition of bone is rendered evidentby subjecting it to certain chemical processes.On exposure to heat, we find it first becomingblack, from the development of the charcoalattendant upon the destruction of the animalmembrane. The oil contained in the cavitiesexudes, and, taking fire, is soon totally consumed.The bone then recovers its whiteness,and undergoes no further change by the actionof the fire. If it be now examined, it willbe found to have lost nearly half its originalCHEMICAL Composition OF BONE. 369weight, and to have become exceedingly brittle ;this, as already mentioned, being the natural propertyof phosphate of lime, when deprived of itsanimal cement. We may perceive on the surfaceof a bone so treated, a number of minute crevices,showing where this animal substance hadbeen situated in its original state. On breakingthe bone across, we may also discover the sizeand shape of the cavities which contained themarrow, or oily fluid above-mentioned.It is easy to reverse this process by steepingthe bone in an acid sufficiently diluted to preventits injuring the animal membrane, but yetsufficiently powerful to dissolve the phosphateand carbonate of lime. Diluted nitric or muriaticacids may be used for this purpose, andwill, in this way, gradually separate the earthyparticles from the membranous portion of thebone. During the action of the acid a fewbubbles of carbonic acid gas make their appearance,indicating the presence of a smallquantity of carbonate of lime, which alwaysexists in bones, intermixed with the phosphate.The phosphate may be recovered from its solutionin the acid by precipitation with a purealkali, such as a solution of ammonia. Thisprecipitate is readily dissolved, without effervescence,by nitric, muriatic, or acetic acids.A small quantity of sulphuric acid may also bedetected in the fluid by the addition of nitratevol. I. b B370 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.of barytes. Iron, in small quantity, is also foundin the composition of human bones.The substance which remains, after the earthhas been thus abstracted, retains the exact figureand dimensions of the original bone, but haslost all its other mechanical properties. It issoft, flexible, and elastic : resembling in everyrespect the muscular or fibrous structures, andbeing, like them, resolvable into gelatin andalbumen by long boiling in water. This substancehas sometimes, but erroneously, beenconsidered as identical with cartilage ; for it hasneither the whiteness, nor the elasticity, nor thetexture of cartilage, nor is it at all similar tothat substance in its chemical composition : forwhile cartilage is formed almost wholly of albumen,the animal basis of bone is almost entirelyresolvable into gelatin.Thus may a bone be analysed into its twoconstituent parts : by the process first describedwe obtain its earth deprived of its animal constituent;by the second, we obtain its membranousbasis free from earth. The first ofthese gives it hardness ; the second, tenacity :and thus, by the intimate combination of theseelements, two qualities, which, in masses of homogeneousand unorganized matter, are scarcelycompatible with one another, are skilfullyunited.The mechanical structure of bone is no lessSTRUCTURE OF BONE. 371worthy of admiration, as evincing the skill withwhich every part is adapted to its destined uses.The animal membrane, which, as we have seen,is the bed in which the calcareous phosphate isdeposited, partakes of the reticular structurebelonging to the ordinary cellular texture ; anda bone, when minutely examined, exhibits alsothe same appearance of plates intermixed withfibres. In the outer compact portion, indeed,the fibrous arrangement of the particles is not soeasily distinguished : but it may be detected inyoung bones while they are becoming ossified :and also in bones that have been long exposedto the weather, or long macerated in water. Theinterior of most bones, in the higher classes ofanimals, presents distinctly the appearance ofirregular cavities, resulting from the partial separationof the plates, and their mutual crossings,and fibrous connexions.The different mechanical purposes for whichbones are employed in the animal economyrequire them to be of different forms. Wherea part is intended to have compactness andstrength, with a very limited degree of motion,it is divided into a great number of small pieces,united together by ligaments, and the separatebones are short and compressed, approachingmore or less to a cubical shape. Of such is thecolumn of the spine composed, as also the jointsof the wrist and ankle. Where the principal372 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.object is either extensive protection, or the provisionof broad surfaces for the attachment ofmuscles, we find the osseous structure expandedinto flat plates; as is exemplified in the bonesof the skull, in the shoulder blade, and stillmore remarkably in the bony shield which surroundsthe body of the tortoise. On the otherhand, where a system of levers is wanted, as inthe limbs, which have to sustain the weight ofthe trunk, and to confer extensive powers oflocomotion, the bones are modelled into lengthenedcylinders, generally somewhat expanded atthe extremities, for greater convenience of mutualconnexion.In the form, the structure, and the arrangementof these levers, which allow of the regularand accurate application of the moving power,and are calculated, in circumstances so various,to give effectual support to the fabric, and alsoto execute a great diversity of movements, wediscern most palpable manifestations of profounddesign, and the most exquisite refinements ofmechanic skill. All the scientific principles ofarchitecture and of dynamics are more or lessexemplified in the construction of this part ofthe animal fabric. Levers of various kinds aremost artificially combined in the formation ofthe fins of fishes, the wings of birds, and thelimbs of quadrupeds. The power of the arch inresisting superincumbent pressure is exhibitedSTRUCTURE OF BONE.in various parts of the osseous systems of vertebratedanimals; such as the human foot, thespine, the pelvis, and more especially in thevaulted roof of the skull, and in the carapace,or upper shell, of the tortoise.The construction of these levers evinces thata minute attention has been bestowed on everycondition by which mechanical advantage couldbe gained. In the more perfect developementsof structures, such as those which obtain in thehigher orders of mammalia, and also in the classof birds, all the long bones arehollow cylinders ; and their cavityis largest in the middle oftheir length. This is shown inFig. 172, which represents alongitudinal section of a humanthigh bone, and in Fig. 173,which is a similar section of thehumerus, or bone of the arm.The walls of these bones consistof a dense and compact substance,formed by the close cohesionof the osseous plates.These walls are of greater thicknessin the middle of the shankor shaft of the column, and becomethinner as we follow themtowards either of the ends. Thisgradual diminution in the thickness of the walls• 374 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.arises from the continual separation of theplates, which bend inwards, and crossing eachother, leave a multitude of irregular spaces orcells, which are called cancelli. The plates, proceedingfrom each side obliquely inwards, atlength meet each other in the axis of thecylinder, so as to close the middle cavity nearthe extremities of the bone, where this spongyor cancellated structure is found to occupy itswhole diameter.Now if we consider that the principal mechanicalproperty required in every cylindricallever is rigidity, and more especially the powerof resisting forces applied transversely, that is,tending to break the cylinder across, we shallsoon perceive, that a given quantity of materialscould not possibly have been disposed inamanner better calculated for such resistancethan when in the form of a tube, or hollow cylinder.*To this mechanical principle I havealready had occasion to advert, when speakingof the hollow stems of vegetables, which derivetheir chief strength from their possessing thisform ; | and we now find it again applied in thestructure of bones, which by having been madeAn elaborate mathematical demonstration of this propositionwas long ago given by Dr. Copperfield, in a paper containedin the first volume of Medical Essays and Observations, publishedby a Society in Edinburgh, p. 95.f P. 81.OSSIFICATION. 375hollow, are rendered considerably stronger thanif the same materials had been collected into asolid cylinder of the same length. We mayfarther remark, that as it is in the middle ofthe shaft that the strain is greatest, so it is herethat the cavity is largest, and the resistancemost effectual.§ 3. Formation and Development of Bone.»But it is not enough to contemplate the purposesso admirably answered by these arrangements.Our curiosity cannot but be powerfullyexcited to learn what processes and refined seriesof means are employed by nature to raiseand to perfect all these artificially contrivedstructures. It fortunately happens that in thisinstance we are permitted to penetrate a littlefarther than usual into the secrets of organicevolution : for the succession of changes can bebetter followed by the eye in the slow developmentof the harder parts, than in the quickergrowth of mere yielding and expansible textures.The peculiar material also, of which boneis formed, is easily distinguished by its hardness,its whiteness, and its opacity from the softer andmore transparent animal substance with whichit is intermixed. Hence we are allowed an THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.opportunity of observing the earliest stages of itsdeposition, and of accurately following the subsequentchanges it undergoes.The parts of the embryo animal, which aredestined to become bone, partake of the softand gelatinous consistence, which, at that earlyperiod, characterises all the textures of thebody; and they can hardly, indeed, be distinguishedfrom the semi-fluid portions whichsurround them. In process of time, when thevascular circulation of the blood has been established,and the newly formed arteries have extendedtheir branches over every part of thenascent organization, those vessels which areappropriated to the task of forming the bones,arrive at the pulpy masses where their work isto commence. As sculptors, before working uponthe marble, first execute a model of a coarser andmore plastic material, so the first business ofthese arteries is to prepare a model of the futurebone, constructed, not with the same materialof which it is afterwards to consist, but with anotherof a simpler and softer nature, namely cartilage.In every case, then, cartilage is firstformed, and becomes visible by its greater opacitywhen compared with the adjacent jelly. It is anexact representation, in miniature, of the bone,which is, in due course, to take its place. It isevident that until the other parts of the fabrichave proceeded so far in their development asOSSIFICATION. 377to have acquired a certain degree of solidity andfirmness, and to bear, as well as to require, thesupport of more massive and rigid structures,this flexible and elastic cartilage may be employedwith great advantage as its substitute. Ahard and unyielding structure would, in the earlystages of its formation, have even been injurious.But in proportion as the fabric is enlarged, thenecessity for mechanical support increases, andfurther provision must be made for resistance toexternal violence.When, at length, all is prepared for the constructionof the bone, the next step to be takenis the removal of the cartilage, which had beenerected as the scaffolding for the intended building.But in taking down this scaffolding, thewhole must not be removed at once ; each partmust be carried away, piece by piece, while theoperation of fixing in their position the beamsand pillars of the edifice proceeds. The way iscleared at first by the absorption of the centralpart of the cartilage, and a few particles ofossific matter are deposited in its room. Whilethis process is going on, greater activity is displayedin the arteries ; they rapidly enlarge indiameter, so as to admit the colouring globulesof the blood ; and they thus become visible tothe eye, which can now follow their coursewithout difficulty. From being at first redpoints, they soon spread out into lines, of which•378 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.we trace the branches to a certain extent, althoughwe cannot pursue them to their minuterramifications. They now assume more activefunctions, and hasten to execute their task bydepositing granules of calcareous phosphate:these are laid down, particle by particle, in acertain determinate order, and in regular lines,so as to form continuous fibres. When a greatnumber of these delicate fibres are gathered together,and connected by other fibres, which shootin various directions across them, a texture composedof an assemblage of long spicula, or thinplates, is constituted.In the cylindrical bones, the spicula prevail,and they are arranged longitudinally, and parallelto one another, and to the axis of the bone.They first constitute a ring in the middle of itslength : this ring enlarges in all its dimensions,but principally in its length; the spicula becominglarger, not by the stretching of theirparts, in consequence of the insinuation of freshmaterials between those already deposited, butby the addition of new particles at both theirextremities. In like manner, the ring increasesin thickness, not by the deposition of phosphateof lime between the original layers, but by theapplication of fresh layers on the outside ofthose already existing.In the flat bones, the process of ossification isvery similar to what I have just described; onlyOSSIFICATION.the fibres have a radiated arrangement, shootingout from the spot where the first deposit tookplace, as from a common centre. This is seenin Fig. 174, which represents the parietal bone of^'JiiVthe human skull, in an early stage of its ossification,and shows the radiating fibres very distinctly.In the cubical, and more irregularlyshaped bones, the process is, doubtless, conductedwith the same order and regularity, althoughit cannot so readily be followed by theeye.The same process is repeated in differentparts of the bone, wherever nature has, in conformitywith determinate laws of development,appointed particular centres of ossification. Thebone continues to extend from each of these centres,proceeding gradually towards the circumference,or the remoter parts of the cartilage, onwhich the ossific materials are moulded, and bythe form of which that of the future bone isregulated. The process of ossification has, THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.ever, this peculiarity, that the cartilage is progressivelyabsorbed to make room for the depositsof bony substance. When the bone is long,separate points of ossification appear in the extremities,before the central portions are ossified ;and the ends, thus formed into bone, are afterwardsunited to the shaft, so that the wholeshall form a continuous bony mass. In the flatbones, also, if the surface be extensive, an additionalnumber of arteries are engaged to performthe work, which is begun from several auxiliarycentres of ossification, and the completion ofwhich is materially accelerated by their co-operation.This mode of increase often gives rise to acurious result, of which a striking example ispresented in the bones of the skull. The brain,which these bones are designed to protect, requirestheir protection at a very early period oflife. The growth of so large a surface of bone,as would be required for covering the brain,could not have proceeded with sufficient quicknessfor the exigencies of the occasion, if it hadoriginated from a single point. Therefore it isthat, besides being commenced at a very earlyage, the process goes on from a great number ofseparate points at the same time. The ossificationis evidently hurried on in order to completethe roofing in of the edifice by the time at whichthe animal is to be ushered into the world, andOSSIFICATION. 381exposed to dangers from the contact of externalbodies. The divergent fibres shoot out rapidly,coalescing with those in their immediate neighbourhood,which co-operate to form an extensivebony plate. When they have reached the prescribedline, they have become so much expandedas to have lost the power of coalescingwith the fibres which have originated from othercentres, and are proceeding in a contrary direction.Yet the arteries still continuing to depositossific matter, each set of fibres insinuate themselvesbetween those of the opposite set, for somelittle distance, and until their further progress isstopped by the increasing resistance they encounter.The consequence is that the edges ofthe bones, which have thus met, are irregularlyjagged, like the teeth of a saw, presenting externallythe zig-zag line of junction which is called asuture. This is seen in Figures 175 and 170, theformer of which represents the upper side of theskull of an infant ; and the latter, the samebones when completely ossified.The union of bony fibres proceeding fromdifferent centres of ossification is not indiscriminate,but is found to be regulated by definitelaws, and to have certain relations to the generalplan of conformation originally established.Each distinct bone is formed from a certainnumber of ossific centres, which altogether constitutea system appertaining to that bone only,382 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.and not extending to the adjacent bones. Thesepieces unite together, as if by a natural affinity ;and they refuse to unite with the bony fibresproceeding from neighbouring centres, and belongingto other groups. The groups themselvesare not arbitrary, but are pre-established parts ofthe original design. Circumstances occasionally,indeed, arise, which may overrule this inherenttendency to preserve the line of separation betweentwo bones ; and we then find them coalescingto form a single piece. Such unions aretechnically called anchises.Were this the whole of what takes place inthe formation of a bone, the process would not,perhaps, differ very materially from that bywhich a shell is produced ; for a shell, as wehave seen, is the result of successive depositionsof calcareous matter, forming . one layer afteranother, in union with a corresponding depositof animal membrane. But the subsequentchanges which occur, show that the constitutionof bone is totally dissimilar to that of shell : forno portion of the shell that is once formed, andhas not been removed, is subject to any fartheralteration. It is a dead, though perhaps notwholly inorganic mass; appended, indeed, tothe living system, but placed beyond the sphereof its influence. But a bone continues, duringthe whole of life, to be an integrant part of thesystem, partaking of its changes, modified byits powers, and undergoing continual altera-ossification.383tions of shape, and even renewals of its substance,by the actions of the living vessels.The form which had at first been rudelysketched, slowly advances towards perfection inthe course of its growth ; and the general proportionsof the parts are still preserved ; thefinished bone exhibiting prominences and depressionsin the same relative situation as at first ;and not only having similar internal cavities, butbeing frequently excavated in parts which hadbefore been solid. During all these gradualalterations of shape, however, there is no stretchingof elastic parts ; for all the osseous fibresand laminae are rigid and unyielding, and in thisrespect retain an analogy with shell. Thechanges thus observed can have been effected inno other way than by the actual removal of suchparts of the young bone as had occupied the situationswhere vacuities are found to exist in theold bone. We find, for instance, that in theearly state of a bone there are no internal cavities,but the whole is a uniform solid mass. Ata certain stage of ossification cells are excavatedby the action of the absorbent vessels, whichcarry away portions of bony matter lying in theaxis of the cylindrical, or in the middle layer ofthe flat bones.* Their place is supplied by anThe bones of the lower classes of vertebrated animals, as ofFishes and Reptiles, seldom reach this stage of ossification, butremain solid throughout; corresponding to the bones of thehigher classes at the early periods of their development.384 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.oily matter, which is the marrow. As the growthproceeds, while new layers are deposited on theoutside of the bone, and at the ends of the longfibres, the internal layers near the centre areremoved by the absorbent vessels, so that thecavity is farther enlarged. In this manner theoutermost layer of the young bone graduallychanges its relative situation, becoming moreand more deeply buried by the new layers whichare successively deposited, and which cover andsurround it; until by the removal of all thelayers situated nearer to the centre, it becomesthe innermost layer ; and is itself destined in itsturn to disappear, leaving the new bone withouta single particle which had entered into thecomposition of the original structure.It has been found that by mixing certaincolouring substances with the food of animalsthe bones will soon become deeply tinged bythem. This fact was discovered accidentally byMr. Beecher, who gives the following accountof the circumstances that led him to notice it.*Happening to be dining with a calico printer ona leg of fresh pork, he was surprised to observethat the bones, instead of being white asusual, were of a deep red colour ; and on inquiringinto the circumstances, he learned that thePhilosophical Transactions for 1736, vol. xxxix. 287 and289.OSSIFICATION. 385pig had been" fed upon the refuse of the dyeing-vats,which contained a large quantity of thecolouring substance of madder. So curious afact naturally attracted a good deal of attentionamong physiologists, and many experiments wereundertaken to ascertain the time required to producethis change, and to determine whether theeffect was permanent, or only temporary. Thered tinge was found to be communicated muchmore quickly to the bones of growing animalsthan to those which had already attained theirfull size. Thus the bones of a young pigeonwere tinged of a rose colour in twenty four hours,and of a deep scarlet in three days ; while inthe adult bird, fifteen days were required merelyto produce the rose colour. The dye was moreintense in the solid parts of those bones whichwere nearest to the centre of circulation, whilein bones of equal solidity, but more remote fromthe heart, the tinge was fainter. The bone wasof a deeper dye in proportion to the length oftime the animal had been fed upon the madder.When this diet was discontinued, the colour becamegradually more faint, till it entirely disappeared,I shall have occasion, in the sequel,to discuss the inferences which have been drawnfrom these curious facts.vol. i. c c386 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.§4. Skeleton of the Vertebrata.The purposes to be answered by the Skeleton,in vertebrated animals, resolve themselves intothe three following; first, the affording mechanicalsupport to the body generally, and also todifferent portions of the body ; secondly, theproviding a solid basis for the attachments ofthe muscles which are to effect their movements ;and thirdly, the giving protection to the vitalorgans, but more particularly to the central partsof the nervous system. Of these the last is thecircumstance that has the greatest influence indetermining the principles on which the osseousframe-work has been constructed. In the nervoussystem of all the animals coming under thedenomination of vertebrata, the spinal marrow,together with the brain, which may, indeed, beconsidered as the anterior extremity of the spinalmarrow, only much enlarged by an additionalmass of nervous substance, are the most importantparts of that system, and the organs whichstand most in need of protection from everykind of injury. These two portions of thenervous system, when viewed as composing asingle organ, have been denominated the spinesaxis, in contradistinction to the analogousparts of the nervous system of articulatedSpina-CEREBRAL AXIS. 387animals: for amidst great differences of structureand of functions, an analogy is still retainedamong the several forms of the nervous system,characterising these two great divisions of theanimal kingdom. In the embryo state of the vertebratathe central parts of that system consistof two separate filaments running parallel to eachother the whole length of the body : but in processof time these two filaments unite, and constitutea single spinal cord : and the primarytype of the skeleton is determined by the peculiarform of this, the central organ of the nervoussystem.In laying the foundations of the skeleton,then, the first object is to provide for the securityof the spinal cord : and this is accomplishedby enclosing it within a series of cartilaginousrings, which are destined to shield it during itsgrowth, and by their subsequent ossification, toprotect it most effectually from all injurious pressure.It is this part of the skeleton, accordingly,of which the rudiments appear the earliest in theembryo animal. These rings form a columnextending in a longitudinal direction along thetrunk ; retracing to us the series of horny rings,in which the bodies of worms, of insects, andindeed of all the Articulate, are encased. Whenossified, these several rings are termed vertebra ;and the entire column which they compose isthe Spine. Fig. 177 shows the form of one of388 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.the vertebrae of the back in the human skeleton.Fig. 178 is a side view of four vertebraejoined together, and Fig. 179 is a vertical sectionof the same part of the spine, showing the canalformed by the rings. From the constancy withwhich the spinal column is found in all animalsof this type, and from the uniformity of theplan on which, amidst endless variations, it ismodelled, it has been chosen as the distinctivecharacter of this great assemblage of animals,which have accordingly been denominated theVertebrata, or Vertebrated Animals.Nor is the spine of less importance whenviewed in its mechanical relations to the rest ofthe skeleton. It is the great central beam ofthe fabric ; establishing points of union betweenall its parts, and combining them into one continuousframe-work : it is the general axis ofall their motions, the common fulcrum on whichthe principal bones of the extremities are madeto turn : it furnishes fixed points of attachmentVERTEBRAL COLUMN. 389to all the large muscles which act upon thesebones as levers, and also to those which movethe trunk itself.If this column had been perfectly rigid, thewhole frame work would have been exposed toinconvenience and even danger, amidst theshocks it must encounter during all the quickand sudden movements of the body. Not onlymust its mechanism be framed to sustain theseshocks, but also to accommodate itself to variouskinds of flexions, and twisting of the trunk.While these objects are provided for, care mustat the same time be taken that the spinal marrowit encloses shall, amidst all these motions,remain secure from pressure ; for so delicate isits structure that the least degree of compressionwould at once interrupt its functions, and leadto the most fatal consequences. A safe passageis likewise to be afforded to the nerves, whichissue from the spinal marrow, at certain intervals,on each side throughout its whole length.No where has mechanical art been more conspicuouslydisplayed than in the construction ofa fabric capable of fulfilling these opposite, andapparently incompatible functions. The principaldifficulty was to combine great strengthwith sufficient flexibility. This we find accomplished,first, by the division of the column intoa great number of pieces, each of which beinglocked in with the two adjoining pieces, and390 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.tightly braced by connecting ligaments, isallowed but a very small degree of flexion at thepoint of junction. This slight flexion at eachsingle joint, however, by becoming multipliedalong the series, amounts to a considerabledegree of motion in the whole column.The broad basis of each bone is connectedwith the next, not by a joint, but by a plate ofequal breadth (m, m, Figures 178 and 179), composedof a peculiar substance, intermediate inits texture to ligament and cartilage, and possessingin a remarkable degree the qualities oftoughness and adhesion, united with compressibilityand elasticity. By yielding for a certainextent to a force tending to bend it to either side,it diminishes the quantity of motion which wouldotherwise have been required in each individualjoint ; and by acting at the same time as aspring, it softens all the jars and concussionsincident to violent action : for we find that howeverthe spine may be bent, no chasm is left bythe flexions of the vertebrae upon one another,nor is the continuity of the column in thesmallest degree interrupted.The motions of the vertebrae upon each otherare further regulated by the mode in which theirarticular processes, which are the pieces thatproject obliquely on each side, play upon eachother. These processes, which are seen at a, a,in the preceding figures (177 and 178), are ofVERTEBRAL COLUMN. 391great use in preventing the sudden displacementof the vertebrae ; for this effect cannot be producedby any force short of that which wouldoccasion fracture. Any one who will try to dislocate,by sheer force, the spine of a hare orrabbit will find reason to admire the art withwhich its bones have been locked together, andthe skill displayed in combining great flexibilitywith such powerful resistance to every effortthat can be made to separate them.For the purpose of allowing a passage to thespinal marrow, the bodies of the vertebrae(b, Fig. 177 and 178), are hollowed out behind,into a groove, over which a broad plate of bone isthrown from the sides of the vertebrae, like thearch of a bridge. The succession of arches,when the vertebrae are joined together, forms acontinuous canal, which is occupied by thespinal marrow. Notches, corresponding to eachother, are left in the sides of each of the arches,forming apertures for the secure passage of thenerves as they issue from the spinal marrow.All these circumstances are visible in the figures,particularly in the section, Fig. 179, where c, c,is the canal for the spinal marrow, and in whichthe apertures just mentioned are distinctly seen,at o, o.In order to give an advantageous purchase tothe muscles which are attached to the spine,each vertebra has, besides the parts above THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.cried, a projecting piece of bone, extendingupwards from the crown of the arch, and denominatedthe spinous process (s, s). The sharpridge that runs along the middle of the back ofa quadruped, is formed by the continued seriesof these processes. There are also, on the sidesof the vertebrae, two other projecting pieces,which are denominated the transverse processes(t), and which serve as levers for bending thecolumn laterally, that is, either to the right or tothe left. All these component parts of the spineare subject to considerable modifications, in differenttribes of animals, according to the particularmechanical circumstances of the system,and to the particular intentions of their formation.There is scarcely any part of the osseousfabric of which the variations better illustratethe strict unity of plan and the beautiful law ofgradation observed by nature in all her operations,than the spine. In studying the variousmodifications which this part of the skeletonundergoes, it will be useful to bear in mind theprinciples, which appear to regulate its formation,and which Geoffrey St. Hilaire has deducedby following the history of its earlygrowth, and noticing the order in which itsseveral parts are developed.* In common withMemoires du Museum, ix. 79 and 89.STRUCTURE OF Vertebrae.all bones, the vertebrae take their rise from certaindeterminate points, or centres of ossification,where, at first, detached pieces of bone areformed, destined to unite together so as to composethe entire bone. An accurate knowledgeof the general forms and relative situations ofthese elementary pieces is of much importance,because we find that particular circumstancesdetermine the development of some of theseparts much earlier, and to a greater extent thanother parts ; and thus lead to great differences inthe shapes and proportions of various bones, atdifferent periods of their growth, although theirorigin and composition are essentially the same.The number of elements which enter into thecomposition of a vertebra has been differentlyestimated by different physiologists: but the followingare certainly entitled to thatcharacter. They are representedin their relative situationsin Fig. 180. The firstis the part which forms thenucleus, or body (b) of thevertebra; and its ossificationbegins at the centre. Nextin importance are the twobony plates, or leaves, as they may be called(l, l), which proceed from the sides of the body,and embrace the spinal marrow which is THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.tufted between them. The fourth essential elementis the spinous process (s), which unites thetwo leaves, and thus completes the superior arch,of which it may be regarded as the key stone,for the protection of the spinal marrow. Thencome the two transverse processes (t, t) whichextend outwards from the sides, and with whichthe arches of bone, that constitute the ribs(r, r) are generally connected. These are thesix parts which may be considered as the elementsthat are most essential, and most constantlypresent in the composition of the vertebrae.But some other parts may also be noticedas of very frequent occurrence : such are thebony plates which cover the two flat portions ofthe bodies of the vertebrae, forming the surfacesimmediately contiguous to the intervertebralligament ; which surfaces, in some of the lowerorders of the vertebrata become articular. Thereis frequently, also, a development of processes(f), forming arches and spines at the lower surfaceof the vertebrae, or the one opposite to thatwhich gives rise to the superior arches alreadymentioned. This structure is very generallymet with in fishes, and it is observed also in thecetacea. The arches thus formed enclose a largeartery, which is the continuation of the aorta, orthe main artery running along the back, immediatelyunder the spinal column.There are still other processes, less constantlySTRUCTURE OF VERTEBRAE. 395present and more variable in their shape. Theyform articular surfaces for the purpose of beingconnected with the surfaces of correspondingprocesses in the contiguous vertebra. Of thesethere are four (a, a, a, a) belonging to each vertebra,two in front, and two behind. These,however, should not be included among theprimary elements of the vertebra?, because wefind them, in different instances, occupyingdifferent positions, and formed sometimes byextensions of the bodies, and at other times ofthe leaves. In following them through the severaltribes of animals, we observe them shiftingtheir places, in various ways, and not even preservingany constancy in their number. Theyare wholly absent in fishes : in the crocodile,and other reptiles, they approximate so as toform three articular surfaces, namely, two closeto one another, and a third posterior to these.In the Ornithorhyncus, while the latter retainsits situation in the middle, the other surfaceshave separated from each other, and have travelledoutwards, taking their stations upon theleaves. In the Mammalia, the middle surfacehas wholly disappeared, and the outer surfaceshave risen into what are termed the oblique processes.In addition to these, accessory bones are oftendeveloped to suit particular occasions. Thus infishes, we see that one or two additional pieces396 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.(i) are affixed to the ends of each spinousprocess. In many cases, instead of being thusplaced in aline with these processes, they appearat a little distance, as if they had slipped fromtheir proper situations ; they are then foundbetween the spinous processes, and receive thename of inter spinous bones.The spinous processes have a tendency, whentheir development proceeds, to divide into twobranches, and this bifurcation frequently takesplace also in the inter spinous bones. The transverseprocesses likewise occasionally developedaccessory pieces, as is found to be the case insome reptiles ; but in other instances they undergoa gradual change of position, as we follow thembackwards along the spinal column, where theydescend towards the abdominal region.The flexibility of particular portions of thespinal column is regulated by the size and formof its processes. When these are much developed,they necessarily obstruct the flexion ofthe vertebrae in the directions in which they aresituated : when they are small, no such hindrancearises, and the spine is free to move in alldirections. Thus, when we see the spinous processesmuch enlarged, while the transverse processesare small, we may infer that the spine isincapable of any bending in that direction ; butthat it has the power of free lateral flexion. ThisSTRUCTURE OF THE SPINE. 397is the condition of the spine of fishes, where thislatter kind of motion is the one principallywanted. In dolphins, and other cetacea, on thecontrary, where the actions are required to bevertically upwards and downwards, the spinousprocesses are small, and the transverse processesvery long and broad.Every instance of variation in the forms ofthese important parts of the osseous system, will,in like manner, be found to have a relation tosome particular circumstance in the living habitsof the animal, and to be subordinate to thegeneral plan of its economy. But in order tounderstand the mode in which nature has effectedthese changes, it is necessary to study the elementsof each part of the osseous system ; forthese constitute the alphabet by which the combinationsshe presents to us become legible, andtheir origin and progress are unfolded to ourcomprehension. According as each of theseelements of ossification receives different degreesof development, so do the different bones theycompose acquire their particular shapes andrelative dimensions. Sometimes, indeed, we findthat one or other of these elements has disappeared;or at least we can discover no traceof its development ; in other cases, we see itexceedingly expanded, and appearing underforms of greater complication, so as to be with398 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.difficulty identified : on some occasions, as wehave just seen in the spinous bones of fishes, itsaccessory structures are multiplied, as if continuedefforts were made by the system to repeatthe same structures. Amidst all these modifications,the parts that preserve the greatest constancyof form are those which are of most importance,and which are constituent parts of theprimordial type of the class to which the individualanimal belongs.The spinal column is generally prolonged atits posterior extremity into a series of vertebrae,which are sometimes exceedingly numerous;decreasing in their size as they extend backwards,and having continually smaller processes, theone disappearing after the other, till all of themare lost, and nothing remains in those at theextremity of the series but the cylindrical bodiesof the vertebrae. Even these become stinted intheir growth and ossification, until we findthe terminal pieces generally remaining in thestate of cartilage. Such is the structure of theosseous support of the tail, as seen in manyquadrupeds in its most developed forms. Itillustrates the law, that when in any systemthere occurs a frequent repetition of the samestructure, the evolution, in the latest of thoserepetitions, becomes less perfect, and ends bybeing abortive. In the present instance, theconsequences of this law are highly advantageCRANIUM. 399genus, since it provides for the flexibility of thetail, and qualifies it for being applied to a greatvariety of useful purposes, as we find more especiallyexemplified in the Ateles, or spider monkey,and in the Kanguroo.Next in importance to the spine is the cranium,or osseous covering of the brain ; togetherwith the bones of the face, which protect theorgans of the finer senses. An accurate investigationof the mode in which these bones areformed has led many modern anatomists to theopinion that they were originally parts of thespinal column, and that they are in fact developmentsof vertebrae, much altered, indeed, inshape, in consequence of the new conditions towhich they have been subjected ; but still possessingall the essential elements of vertebrae.In the embryo condition of these organs, andwhile the brain is yet undeveloped, the resemblanceof the bony circles which enclose it tovertebrae is certainly very striking ; but in proportionas the brain becomes expanded, the similaritydiminishes ; for the rapid growth of thebrain in the higher orders of animals is necessarilyattended with an equally sudden expansionof the bones of the skull. Hence theirseveral elements are thrown into unusual positions,and being variously distorted and disfigured,can hardly be recognised under thestrange disguises they assume.400 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.The extensive researches that have been recentlymade in this branch of comparative anatomy,have supplied many facts which tend tosupport the hypothesis that the bony coveringsof the brain are the result of the developmentof three vertebrae. According to this theory, thefirst of these supposed cranial vertebra, beginningour enumeration from the neck, is the origin ofthe occipital bone, of which the lower part, orthat which immediately supports the cerebellum,corresponds to the body of the vertebra ; the twolateral portions, to the leaves; and the upperflat plate to the spinous process. The body ofthe second cranial vertebra becomes, in processof time, the posterior half of the sphenoid bone,which lies in the middle of the basis of theskull; the temporal bones being formed by itsleaves, and the parietal bones by the lateralhalves of its spinous process. The third cranialvertebra is constituted by the anterior halfof the sphenoid bone, which is its body, andthe frontal bones, which are its leaves. Thistheory, which originated with Open, has beenfurther extended to the bones of the face, byGeoffrey St. Hilaire, who conceives them to belikewise developements of several other supposedcranial vertebrae ; * but the analogies by whichthe hypothesis is supported become more feebleIn this theory of G. St. Hilaire the number of cranial vertebraeis seven, each composed of nine elementary pieces,SKELETON OF VERTEBRATA. 401and confused as we recede from the middle ofthe spinal column.All the other parts of the skeleton may beregarded as accessory to the spine : and they arefar from exhibiting the same constancy either informor number, as the vertebral column. Insome instances, as in serpents, these accessoryparts are altogether wanting; in others, theyexist only in rudimental states ; and it is but inafew that they can be considered as havingreached their full development. In order toobtain a standard of comparison by which toestimate all their gradations of evolution, it willbe best to consider them first in their moreperfectly developed forms, as they are presentedin the higher classes of quadrupeds.In the following descriptions, the skeleton of theHog (Fig. 181) will be taken for the purpose ofreference.The ribs consist of arches of bone affixed attheir upper ends to the bodies of the vertebrae,and also, by a separate articulation, to theirtransverse processes ; where, in general, theyare allowed a slight degree of motion. Theirprimary use is to defend the vital organs situatedin the region of the chest, or thorax(namely, the heart and the lungs) ; but theyare subservient also to the function of respiration,by the alternate movements that are givento them by their muscles. The two parts, ofVOL. I. D DTHE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS,which they are composed, often form an angleby their junction, and at this angle a processoccasionally extends, for the purpose of formingconnexions with the neighbouring ribs.The ribs are connected in front with thebreast bone, or sternum (s), often by the interventionof cartilages, which, from their similarityof form to the ribs, appear as continuationsof them, and are provided apparently to eke outthe remainder of the semicircle. These cartilages,which have been termed the sterno-costalappendices, often become ossified, either whollyor in part.The sternum is formed of nine elementarypieces, each proceeding from a separate centreof ossification. Two of these occupy the endwhich is nearest to the head, four are lateral,and two are situated at the opposite extremity :SKELETON OF VERTEBRATA. 403one only being central and surrounded by therest. Few subjects in comparative osteology aremore curious and instructive than to trace thedevelopment of these several elementary partsin the different classes of animals, from the rudimentalstates of this bone as it occurs infishes, to its greatly expanded conditions in thetortoise and the bird, which severally exhibitthe most opposite proportions of these elements.Last in the order of constancy come the bonesof the extremities. As we ascend in the scale ofanimals we may observe the prevalence of a tendencyto the concentration of organs, and consequentlyto the diminution of their number.While in animals of the inferior orders, whichare possessed of extremities, we find a considerablenumber of legs; in all the animalscomprised in the class of true insects naturehas limited the number to six ; and in thevertebrata it never exceeds four. As in insectswe observed that all the legs are divided into thesame number of parts ; so we find among quadrupedsa striking correspondence in the bonesof the fore and the hind extremities. Both theone and the other are connected with the spineby the intermediate of large and broad bones,which are intended to serve as a basis for theirmore secure attachment, and for giving, at thesame time, extensive and advantageous purchaseto the muscles, which are to move the limbs.404 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.The two bones by which the anterior extremityis connected with the trunk are the blade-bone,or Scapula (b), which sends out a process calledthe coracoid bone; and the collar-bone, or theClavicle* which extends from the scapula to thesternum. The corresponding connecting bonesof the posterior extremity are three in number,and constitute, together with the part of thespine to which they are attached, what is calledthe Pelvis (p). The part of the spine which isthus included in the pelvis, is termed the Sacrum:In its complete state of ossification it is a singlebone ; but it was originally composed of anumber of separate vertebrae, which have afterwardsbecome consolidated into a single bone,and which bear the marks of having been compressedfrom behind forwards during their growth,so that they could only expand laterally. Thevertebrae which succeed to these, and which arenot consolidated with the sacrum, compose whatis called the os coccygis, (q), or more properly thecoccygeal vertebra: when they are sufficientlynumerous to compose a tail, they come under thedenomination of caudal vertebra. The threeThis bone does not exist in the skeleton of the hog ; but itsform and connexions with the sternum and scapula in thehuman skeleton are shown in Fig. 182, where s is the sternum;c, the clavicle ; b, the scapula; a, the acromion; k, the coracoidprocess ; and g, the glenoid cavity for the articulation ofthe humerus.SKELETON OF VERTEBRATA. 405bones of the pelvis, are the ilium, the ischium,and the pubis. They all concur in the formationof a large cup-like cavity, called the acetabulum,which receives the head of the thigh bone (f),constituting generally the largest joint in thebody.A single bone composes the first division ofeach limb, both in the fore and hind extremities.In the fore leg it is termed the humerus (h), in thehind leg, the femur (f). The next division containstwo bones, placed parallel to each other;they are in the former, the radius (r), and theulna (u) ; in the latter, the tibia (t), and fibula (f).These are followed by a number of small,rounded or cubical bones, collected together inagroup, which constitutes the Carpus (w), inthe fore leg, and the l y argus (t), in the hind leg.Next come a set of long cylindrical bones, composingthe metacarpus (m), in the former, and themetatarsus (m), in the latter case. In the mostcomplete forms of development these are alwaysfive in number in each limb ; they are placedgenerally parallel to each other, but are envelopedin one common covering of integument.The Phalanges, or toes (z), are cylindrical bones,continued in a line from each of the former :they are generally three in number in each toe.To the last joint, which is often termed the ungualbone, there is usually attached either a nail,a claw, or a hoof. Small detached bones are406 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.frequently found at the exterior part of the angleswhich they form by their junction, serving thepurpose of giving a more advantageous positionto the tendons of the muscles which extendthose joints. The patella, or knee pan, (k), isthe largest of these, and is pretty constantlypresent. Smaller bones of this description aremet with on the joints of the fingers, and aretermed sesamoid bones.On comparing these divisions of the limbs ofquadrupeds with those of insects we cannot failto perceive that there exists between them amarked analogy : and that naturalists were notled away by mere fancy when they applied tothe latter the same names as those borne by theformer. This, however, is not the only instanceof analogy that may be discovered between thestructures of articulated and of vertebrated animals,however strong may be the contrast whichthey offer in all the essential features of theirconformation. The rings which compose theskeleton of the insect, and which enclose its principalnervous chords, have been supposed to havean analogy with the circles of bone which constitutethe primary forms of the vertebrae, and whichcontain the spinal chord ; although in the firstcase, it is true, other viscera are included withinthe arches, whereas none are contained in thelast case. They agree, also, in having the headplaced at one extremity, distinct from the trunk,SKELETON OF VERTEBRATA. 407and containing the principal organs of the senses.Further correspondences have been likewisetraced in the minuter anatomy of these parts,which it would here occupy too much space toexamine in detail.An approximation is evidently made towardsan internal skeleton in the cephalopodous mollusca;where we find a central body, cartilaginousin some species, calcareous in others.In the Loligo it has a long and slender shape,and is pointed at the end like the blade of asword ; it bears, as we shall hereafter notice, someresemblance to the cartilaginous spine of thefish called the Myxine, or Gastrobranchus, whichdoes not enclose the spinal marrow, but onlyadmits it to pass along a groove in its upperedge.All these multiplied instances, when weighedtogether, and united in a comprehensive view,are sufficient to prove, that there exist very perceptiblelinks of connexion among all the classesof created beings, even in those apparently themost remote from one another. They render itclear to the discerning eye of the philosophicnaturalist, that all the races of animated beingsare members of one family, and the offspring ofthe same provident parent, who has matured allhis plans on a deeply premeditated system, andwho dispenses all his gifts with the most salutaryregard to the general welfare of his creatures.Chapter VIIIFISHES.In reviewing the series of animals which composeeach great division of this kingdom of nature,we constantly find that the simplest structuresand modes of progression are those belonging tothe aquatic tribes. Among vertebrated animals,the lowest rank is occupied by Fishes, a classcomprehending an immense number of species,which are all inhabitants of the water, whichexhibit an endless variety of forms, and open tothe physiologist a wide field of interesting research.We cannot fail to perceive, on the mostcursory glance, the beautiful adaptation of theform and structure of all these animals to theproperties of the element in which they aredestined to reside. In order that the fish mightglide through the fluid with the least resistance,all its vital organs have been collected into asmall compass, and the body has been reducedinto the shape of a compact oval, compressedlaterally, and tapering to a thin edge, both beforeand behind, for the purpose of readily cleavingthe water as the fish darts forward, and also ofobviating the retardation that might arise fromFISHES. 409the reflux of the water collected behind. Witha view to diminish friction as much as possible,the surface of the body has been rendered smooth,and the skin impregnated with oil, which defendsit from injurious impressions, and at the sametime prevents the water from penetrating into itssubstance.The body of a fish is nearly of the same specificgravity as the water it inhabits ; and theeffect of gravity is therefore almost whollycounterbalanced by the buoyant force of thatfluid : for the weight of a mass of water, equalin bulk to the body itself, is the exact measureof this buoyant force. If this weight were preciselythe same as that of the fish, the animalwould be able to remain suspended in any partof the fluid without the necessity of employingany voluntary motion or exertion for that purpose: but as the body of a fish is generally alittle heavier than the fluid medium, especiallyif it be fresh water, it is necessary for the animalto give its body some degree of motion, in orderto prevent its sinking.In land quadrupeds, the limbs have to performthe double office of supporting the body, and ofeffecting at the same time its locomotion : but asnearly the whole of the weight of a fish is alreadysustained by the element in which it is immersed,its instruments of motion may be employed exclusivelyfor progression ; and the powerful410 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.hydrostatic pressure, which supports the bodyon all sides, supersedes the necessity of that cohesiverigidity of frame, which is essential to thesafety of terrestrial animals. Hence we findthat in one whole tribe of fishes, the skeleton iscomposed merely of cartilage ; and, in all, it exhibitsmuch less of the osseous character than inthe higher classes. The frame-work of the skeleton,even of osseous fishes, has not the compactnesspossessed by that of quadrupeds orreptiles : the pieces which compose it are joinedtogether less firmly ; many of them, indeed,remain in an imperfectly ossified condition, theirelementary pieces being detached from one another,as if the usual process of consolidation hadbeen arrested at an early stage. The texture ofthe bones of cartilaginous fishes corresponds tothis primeval condition ; for it is composed merelyof granules of calcareous phosphate, interspersedamidst the cartilaginous substance in detachedmasses, or presenting the appearance of coarsefibres, thinly scattered through the semitransparentbone. Compared with the quantity ofgelatin which enters into their composition, thebones of fishes contain but a small proportion ofearthy ingredient ; a circumstance which explainsthe pellucidity of the mass, and the readinesswith which the osseous fibres it containscan be distinguished. Another consequence ofthe want of density in the bones of fishes is, thatFISHES. 411their articulations are less regular and perfectthan the corresponding joints of terrestrial animals;for it is evident that where the parts aresoft and flexible, joints are not required.In the osseous fishes, the bony structures aremore finished ; and they even arrive at a degreeof hardness equal to that of the higher classes.But this development is not uniform in all thebones; in the head of the pike, for instance,while some of the bones have acquired a greathardness, others remain wholly and permanentlyin a cartilaginous condition. The bones of fishes,however advanced in their ossification, neverreach that stage of the process in which cavitiesare formed ; thus there is no space for marrow,nor even for the cellular or cancellated structurewhich we have noticed in the more perfect bones.*The general disposition of the bones which composethe entire skeleton will be understood fromFig. 184, which represents that of the CyprinusCuvier, sur les Poissons. Tom. i. p. 218.412 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.carpio, or carp. The muscular flesh of fishes islikewise softer than that of the higher classes ;and the cellular substance more attenuated andmore gelatinous ; so that the membranes whichit forms are of a looser and more pulpy texture.Progressive motion in fishes is effected by thesimplest means, the principal instrument employedfor this purpose being the tail ; for thefins, as we shall presently find, are merely auxiliaryorgans, serving chiefly to balance the bodywhile it receives its propulsion from the tail. Afish moves in the w T ater upon the same principleas a boat is impelled in sculling ; for the actionof the tail upon the water is lateral, like thatof an oar, which it resembles in the verticalposition of its plane ; and the effect is transferredi) by the resistance of the water to/ | the body where the impulse oris\ B minutes. Let us suppose, forexample, that the tail is slightlyinclined to the right, as shownin Fig 185. If, in this situation,the muscles on the left side,tending to bring the tail in aright line with the body, are suddenlythrown into action, the resistance of thewater, by reacting against the broad surface ofthe tail in the direction p r, perpendicular to thatsurface, will cause the muscular action to givethe whole body an impulse in that direction ; andPROGRESSIVE MOTION IN FISHES. 413the centre of gravity, c, will move onwards in thedirection c b, parallel to p r. This impulse isnot destroyed by the farther flexion of the tailtowards the left side, because the principal forceexerted by the muscles has already been expendedin the motion from r to m, in bringing itto a straight line with the body ; and the forcewhich carries it on to l is much weaker, andtherefore occasions a more feeble reaction.When the tail has arrived at the position l, indicatedby the dotted outline, a similar action ofthe muscles on the right side will create a resistanceand an impulse in the direction of k l, and amotion of the whole body in the same direction,c a. These impulses being repeated in quicksuccession, the fish moves forwards in the diagonalc d, intermediate between the directions ofthe two forces. By bending the whole bodyalmost in a circle, and then suddenly straighteningit, fishes are often able to leap to the top of ahigh cataract, in ascending against the stream ofa river.Such being the plan upon which progressionis to be effected, we find that every part of themechanism of the fish is calculated to promoteits execution. The principal muscular strengthis bestowed upon the movements of the tail ; andthe largest assemblage of muscles consists of thosewhich give it the lateral flexions that have beenjust described. For this purpose all the importsMECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.tant viscera are placed forwards, and crowdedtowards the head. No room is allowed for aneck ; and the abdomen may be almost regardedas continuous with the head, there being properlyno intervening thorax ; for the respiratory organsare situated rather beneath than behind thehead. All this has been done with a view toleave ample scope for the prolonged expansionof the coccygeal vertebrae, and of their muscles,which compose more than half the bulk of theanimal.Having seen how all impediments to the freemotion of the tail have been carefully removed,let us next inquire into the mechanism by whichmobility has been given to that organ. The firstpeculiarity we meet with in the structure ofthe spine of fishes is the mode in which thevertebrae are connected together. The bodies ofeach vertebra, as may be seen in Figures 186and 187, are hollowed out, both before andSKELETON OF FISHES. 415behind, (considering the spinal column as extendedhorizontally), so as to form cup-likehollows : by which means, where the concavesurfaces of two adjacent vertebrae are applied toone another, a cavity, having the shape of adouble cone, is formed by the junction of themargins of these conical hollows. These cavitiesare distinctly seen laid open in Fig. 188,which represents a vertical section of threeadjacent vertebrae of a cod. The edges that arein contact, are united all round by an elasticligament, which readily yields to the bending ofthe vertebrae upon one another by the applicationof any force to one side of the spine, andrestores it to its former state when the force hasceased to act. The extent of motion in eachjoint is but small; but being multiplied in thewhole series, the resulting effect is considerable.The cavity itself is filled with a gelatinous, butincompressible fluid substance, which constitutesa spherical pivot for all the motions of the joint.This singular kind of articulation would appearframed with a view to allow of motion in alldirections. Here, however, the motions arerestricted by the extension of the spinous processes(s, s, in the preceding figures), which infishes are of great length ; so that they effectuallyprevent all flexions either upwards ordownwards, and limit it to those from side toside. It is precisely these latter kind of motions416 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.that are wanted in the fish, for striking the waterlaterally, with the broad vertical surface of thetail. Processes of a similar form and appearance,(f, f), and which impede any flexiondownwards, are generally also met with inthe lower surface of the spine, and more especiallyin the hinder portion of the column. Theseare the inferior spinous processes, and, like thesuperior, they also form an arch, throughwhich there passes the continuation of theabdominal aorta, or great artery which proceedsdown the back. The number of vertebrae isvery various in different fishes : in some theyare multiplied exceedingly, as in the shark,where there are more than two hundred.There are few parts of the structure of animalsthat exhibit more remarkable instances of thelaw of gradation than the spine of fishes, inwhich we may trace a regular progress of developmentfrom the simplest and almost rudimentalcondition in which it exists in theMyxine and the Lamprey, to that of the mostperfect of the osseous tribes. Its condition, inthe former of these animals, presents a closeanalogy with some structures that are metwith in the molluscous, and even in annuloseanimals. So near is the resemblance of thespinal column of the myxine, more especially, tothe annular condition of the frame-work of thevermes, that doubts have often arisen in theSTRUCTURE OF FISHES. 417minds of naturalists whether that animal oughtnot properly to be ranked among this latterclass. Its pretensions to be included among thevertebrata are, indeed, but slender and equivocal; for, in place of a series of bones composingthe vertebral column, it has merely a softand flexible tube of a homogeneous and cartilaginoussubstance, exhibiting scarcely any traceof division into separate rings, but appearing asif it were formed of a continuous hollow cylinderof intervertebral substance, usurping the place ofthe vertebrae, which it is the usual office of thatsubstance to connect together, and having in itsaxis a continuous canal filled with gelatinousfluid. This, however, is not the channel intendedfor containing the spinal marrow, for that nervouscord is on the outside of this column. Thecartilage, indeed, sends out no processes to bendround the spinal marrow, and forms no canal forits passage and protection. The nervous matterhere consists merely of two slender cords, whichrun parallel to one another in a groove on theupper part of the spinal column ; and thesecords are covered only by a thin membrane, thepresence of which it requires very minute attentionto detect. The partial protection thus affordedto so important an organ is not greaterthan that given by the cartilaginous lamina ofthe cuttle-fish, which in form, texture, andVOL. I. E E41 8 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.situation is very analogous to the spine of themyxine.As we ascend from this rudimental conditionof the spine, we find it, in the lamprey, moredistinctly divided into rounded portions, appearinglike beads strung together. These rudimentalbodies of vertebrae have not yet completedthe cup-like hollows on their two ends,but are shaped like rings, being perforated in thecentre, so as still to form a continuous canalthroughout the whole column.Proceeding to more advanced developements,we find, in the sturgeon and other cartilaginousfishes, a greater condensation of substance producedby the deposition of granules of osseousmatter ; the central canal becomes divided intolozenge-shaped compartments by the closing in ofthe sides of the body of each vertebra.* Frequentlythe sides do not quite meet, and theleaves, which are developed from the uppersurfaces of the vertebrae, now form arches overthe spinal cord, and are united above by spinousprocesses. Yet the whole skeleton in theseA small aperture still remains, establishing a communicationbetween the cavities the whole length of the spine. This is supposedto be designed to obviate the compression of the fluid inthe different cells or cavities during the motions of the spine.The vertical sections, Fig. 189 and 190, of two contiguous vertebrain different fishes, will convey an idea of this gradation ofdevelopment.STRUCTURE OF FISHES. 419fishes remains in the incipient stage of ossification,being more or less cartilaginous ; andwhere the ossific process has begun, it has notadvanced the length of producing union betweenthe pieces formed from the separate centres ofossification. Where they meet without uniting,they form no sutures, but overlap one another.Thus the bony structures are detached, and oftencompletely isolated ; affording to the physiologistan opportunity of studying the earlier stagesof this interesting process, and marking withdistinctness the number of the elements of eachbone, and the relative situations of their centres.This knowledge is more especially of importancetowards understanding the formation and connectionsof the bones of the head, which arevery numerous and complicated ; and the investigationof which has been prosecuted with extraordinarydiligence by Geoffrey St. Hilaireand other continental anatomists.It is here, more especially, that we obtain theclearest evidence of the derivation of the cranialbones from vertebrae analogous to those of thespine. The occipital bone, in particular, correspondsto a spinal vertebra in all its essentialelements. In many fishes, the body of thisbone, being lengthened out to form the posteriorpart of the basis of the skull, becomes the basilarportion. We find, on its posterior surface,420 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.the same cup-like cavity as in the true vertebrae ;and it is joined to the next vertebra in the samemanner as the spinal vertebrae are joined to eachother. Its crest has the exact shape of a spinousprocess. In front the basilar bone is unitedto the spend bone, which, with the vaulted roofthat springs from the sides of both these bones,like the leaves and spinous processes of the vertebrae,form together a long cranial cavity. Thiscavity is placed in a direct line with the spinalcanal, and contains the nervous tubercles whichconstitute the brain. Yet the brain does not completelyfill this cavity; for a space is still left,which is occupied by a pulpy substance. In likemanner, the accordance of the other cranial boneswith vertebrae, has been attempted to be traced ;but in proportion as we recede from the centralparts of the spine, this correspondence is lessdistinct, in consequence of the various degreesof development which these several elementshave received, in order to adapt them to particularpurposes relating to sensation, to the prehensionand deglutition of the food, and also toaquatic respiration. It is impossible, however,without exceeding the limits within which Imust here confine myself, to enter into the detailsof structure which would be requisite in order torender this subject sufficiently intelligible.The rest of the skeleton of fishes is extremelysimple. In many, as in the Ray and Tetrodon,STRUCTURE OF FISHES. 421there are no ribs. Where these bones exist,they are articulated with the extremities of thetransverse processes of the vertebrae, of whichthey appear to be merely continuations, or appendices.There is generally no sternum towhich they can be attached below : in a fewfishes only, such as the herring and the dory, wefind rudiments of this bone, consisting of a fewpieces placed in a line on the lower part of thetrunk.*The parts of the skeleton of fishes, which correspondto the arms and legs of quadrupeds, arethe pectoral and ventral fins (marked respectivelyby the letters p and v in Fig. 184). The formerare met with, with but few exceptions, in allfishes ; and they consist of a series of osseouspieces, in which we may often recognise with tolerableprecision the analogous bones composingthe anterior extremities of a quadruped ; such asthe scapula, clavicle, humerus, ulna, and radius. tThese two latter bones are very distinctly markedThe bony arches arising from the skull, which support thebranchiae, or gills, have been considered as the bones correspondingto the ribs of terrestrial quadrupeds ; and if this view weretaken of them, it would tend to confirm the analogy of the cranialbones to the spinal vertebrae.f Those anatomists who are fond of pursuing the theory ofanalogies, maintain that all these bones are merely developementsof certain ribs, proceeding from the spine in its anterior parts.A similar origin has been assigned to the pieces of bone to whichthe ventral fins are attached : but it is difficult to reconcile thisTHE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.in the Lophius piscatorius, or Angler, as may beseen in Fig. 191, where b is the scapula; c, theclavicle ; u, the ulna ; and r, the radius. Thecarpus may also be recognised in a chain ofsmall bones, w, interposed between the radiusand the Phalanges, z. In the Ray these phalangesare very numerous, and each is dividedinto several pieces by regular articulations :these are shown in Fig. 192 : they are arrangedclose to one another in one plane, and form aneffectual base of support to the integument whichcovers them. The scapula, according to Cuvier,is sometimes detached from the rest of the skeleton,and at other times connected with thespine : in most cases, however, it is suspendedtheory with the fact that these bones do not proceed from thespine, and are quite detached from the rest of the skeleton. Itis evident, therefore, that if they are to be considered as analogousto the bones of the hinder extremities in the mammalia,they are in a condition of very imperfect development.STRUCTURE OF FISHES. 423from the cranium ; a fact which may be citedin further corroboration of the analogy whichthe cranial bones have to vertebrae.In the ray and the shark tribes, both the anteriorand posterior extremities are supported byarches of bones, forming a sort of belt. Thisstructure is an approachto that whichobtains in many reptiles,and indicates afurther step in the regular progress of development.This belt in the ray is shown in Fig. 193.In examining that part of the skeleton of fisheswhich corresponds to the posterior extremity, weobserve the total absence of both femur andtibia ; but the bones of the toes are attached toa set of small bones, which appear to act thepart of a pelvis, but which, in consequence oftheir not being connected with the spine, haveno determinate situation, and are found at variousdistances from the head in different fishes.They appear emancipated from the restraints towhich they would have been subjected had theybeen fixed to a sacrum, or to any particularpart of the spine : and we find them, accordingly,often placed considerably forwards ; andin some instances, as in the Subbrachieni, evenanteriorly to the pectoral fins, which are thetrue arms of the animal. But in one wholeorder of fishes, the Abodes, there is not even a424 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.vestige of ventral fins, nor are any pelvic bonesprovided for their support. This is the casewith the Eel, the Gymnotus, &c. In a few speciesthere is also a total absence of pectoral as wellas ventral fins.The dorsal fins are supported by a series ofslender bones (d Fig. 184), which are joined tothe spinous processes of the vertebrae, and areformed from distinct centres of ossification.These rays, as they are called, are sometimesdestined to grow to so considerable a length, asto require being subdivided into many pieces,in order to lessen the danger of fracture, towhich a very long filament of bone would havebeen exposed, and also to allow of a greater degreeof flexibility. These rays assume branchedforms from the further subdivision of their parts,and when, for the purpose of adding strength tothe fin, it becomes necessary to multiply the pointsof support, intermediate bones are developed,serving as the basis of the rays. Conveniencerequires that they should be detached from theends of the spinous processes, which is theirusual position, and placed between them : whenin this situation, they bear the name of inter-spinousbones; and when a still greater lengthof osseous support is wanted, new centres ofossification are developed at their extremities,giving rise to a series of additional pieces, joinedend to end, and carrying out the interspinousMUSCULAR SYSTEM OF FISHES. 425bone, and the ray which terminates it, to a considerabledistance. This structure is distinctlyseen in the small dorsal fins of the MackareLThe anal fins, which are situated on the lowerside of the body, in the vertical plane, and nextto the tail, are, in like manner, supported byrays, having the same parallel, or fan-like arrangementas the preceding. The caudal fin, or terminalexpansion of the tail has also a similarstructure.The muscles of fishes compose a large portionof the bulk of the body, but they are arrangedin a less complex manner than those of the animalsof the higher classes. Those which appearimmediately underneath the integuments areshown in Fig. 194, where m, m are the greatlateral muscles, producing the flexion of thebody and tail : d is the dorsal fin, which israised by the muscle d ; p, the pectoral fin,expanded by the muscle p : v, the ventral fin,moved by the muscles situated at v : a, the analfin, in like manner moved by muscles at itsbase a : and c, the caudal fin, the muscles for426 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.having which are seen at c : o is the operculum,or flap, which covers the gills : and n, thenasal cavities, or organs of smell. The form ofthe body, and disposition of the skeleton, allowof their being inserted immediately on the partswhich they are intended to approximate. Hencethe use of long tendinous chords is dispensedwith.*The actions of the muscles are easily understoodfrom the nature of their insertions. Ingeneral, the direction of the fibres is in somedegree oblique, with reference to the motionperformed. Two series of muscles are providedfor the movements of the tail, which consistalmost exclusively of lateral flexion, the wholespine in some degree participating in this motion.These muscles occupy the upper and lowerportions of the trunk ; their limits being stronglymarked by a line running longitudinally thewhole length of the body on each side. Theinclination of their fibres is somewhat differentin each. The advantage in point of velocity ofaction which results from this obliquity has alreadybeen pointed out.Those fins which are in pairs are capable offour motions ; namely, those of flexion and ex-betweenthe layers of flesh, however, there occur slendersemi-transparent tendons, which give attachment to a series ofshort muscular fibres, passing nearly at right angles between thesurfaces of the adjoining plates.

Carlisle's accountof this structure in the Philosophical Transactions for 1806.SWIMMING IN FISHES. 427tension, and also those of expanding and closingthe rays ; for each of which motions appropriatemuscles are provided : and indeed each ray isfurnished with a distinct muscular apparatus forits separate motion ; and these smaller musclesregulate with great nicety all the movements ofthe fins, expanding or closing them like a fan,according as their action is to be strengthenedor relaxed. This feathering of the fin, as itmay be called, takes place in most fishes, andis particularly observable in the tail of the Esox,or pike tribe. Each ray of these fins, indeed, isfurnished with a distinct muscular apparatus,for its separate motion.Whatever analogy may exist in the structureof the fins of fishes and the feet of quadrupeds,there is none in the manner in which they areinstrumental in effecting progressive motion.The great agent by which the fish is impelledforwards is the tail : the fins, which correspondto the extremities of land animals, are usefulchiefly for the purposes of turning, stopping, orinclining the body, and for retaining it in itsproper position. The single fins, or those whichare situated in a vertical plane, passing throughthe axis of the body (the mesial plane), preventthe rolling of the body, while the fish darts forwardsin its course. The fins that are in pairs(that is the pectoral and the ventral fins), bytheir alternate flexions and extensions, act likeoars ; while they are capable, at the same time,428 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.of expanding and of closing the rays, like theopening and shutting of a fan, according as theiraction is required to be effective or the contrary.All these auxiliary instruments are chiefly serviceablein modifying the direction, and adjustingthe variations of force derived from theimpulse of the tail. They are employed also insuddenly checking or stopping the motion, andgiving it a more rapid acceleration. But stillthe tail is the most powerful of the instrumentsfor progression, being at once a vigorous oar, anaccurate rudder, and a formidable weapon ofoffence.Independently of these external instrumentsof progression, most fishes are provided with internalmeans of changing their situation in thewater. The structure by which this effect isaccomplished is one of the most remarkable instancesthat is met with of an express contrivancefor a specific purpose, and of the employmentof an agency of a class different fromthat of the mechanical powers usually resortedto for effecting the same object. We have seenthat if the body of a fish were heavier than anequal bulk of water, and if no muscular exertionswere made, it must necessarily descend in thatfluid. If, on the contrary, it were specificallylighter, it would as necessarily rise to the surface.Were the animal to acquire the power of alteringat pleasure its specific gravity, it would then pos-swimmingBLADDER OF FISHES,less the means of rising or sinking, withoutcalling into action either the fins or the tail.Such is precisely the object of a peculiar mechanism,which nature has provided in theinterior of the body of the fish. A large bladder,filled with air, has been placed immediatelyunder the spine, in the middle of the back, andabove the centre of gravity. This is known bythe name of the air-bladder, or the swimmingbladder, and in the cod-fish it is called the sound.It frequently, as in the Carp, consists of twobladders (a, b, Fig. 195) joined endwise, andcommunicating with each other by a narrowneck.* When distended with air, it renders thewhole fish specifically lighter than the surroundingwater ; and the fish is thus buoyed up, andremains at the surface without any effort of itsown. On compressing the bladder, by the actionof the surrounding muscles, the included air isThere is great variety in the form and structure of theair-bladder in different fishes. Sometimes it contains a largeglandular body of a peculiar structure, which has been conjecturedto be an apparatus for secreting air from the blood : butit is by no means very generally met with.430 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.condensed, the specific gravity of the whole bodyis increased, and the fish sinks to the bottom. Onrelaxing the same muscles, the air recovers itsformer dimensions, and the fish is again renderedbuoyant. Can there be stronger evidenceof design than the placing of this hydrostaticapparatus, acting upon philosophical principles,in the interior of the organization, for a purposeso definite and unequivocal ?In several tribes of fishes there is a canal(c d) establishing a communication betweenthis bladder and the stomach, or the gullet (o) ;so that by compressing the bladder, a quantityof air may be forced out, and a very suddenincrease of specific gravity produced ; followed,of course, by a quick descent. When, by anyaccident, the air bladder has been opened, orhas burst, so that all the air has escaped, thefish is seen to grovel at the bottom, lying on itsback, and can never afterwards rise to the surface.On the other hand, it occasionally happensthat a fish which has remained too long atthe surface of the sea, exposed to the scorchingrays of a tropical sun, suddenly finds itself retainedagainst its will at the surface, becausethe bladder has become over distended by theheat, and resists all the efforts which the animalcan make to compress it. It thus continuesfloating, until the coolness of the night hasagain condensed the air in the bladder to itsSWIMMING BLADDER OF FISHES. 431former bulk, and restored the power of descending.Some tribes of fish are totally unprovidedwith an air-bladder. This is the case w 7 with theflounder, the sole, and other genera of a flatshape, forming the family of Pleuroncetes. Theyare chiefly inhabitants of sand-banks, or othersituations where they are comparatively stationary,seldom moving to a distance, or risingmuch in the water ; and when they do so, it iswith manifest effort, for their ascent must beaccomplished entirely by the continued beatingand flapping of the water with their expandedpectoral fins. It is only the larger fish of thisform, such as rays, which have very voluminousand powerful pectoral fins for striking the waterdownwards with considerable force, that can risewith facility without the assistance of an air-bladder.In these, the lateral fins, which areenormous expansions of the pectoral fins, maybecompared to wings, their vertical action onthe water being similar in effect to the correspondingmovements of a bird, when it risesvertically in the air. Those fishes which swimrapidly, and frequently ascend and descend inthe water, are in general provided with thelargest air-bladders.In studying the varieties presented by theforms of the fins in different tribes of fishes, wefind the same constant relation preserved with432 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.the particular situations and circumstances inwhich they are placed. The dorsal fins, whichare more especially useful for steadying thebody, are longest in those fishes which inhabitthe most stormy seas. The most voracioustribes, which incessantly pursue their prey, arefurnished with most powerful muscles, andpossess the greatest means of rapid progression.On the other hand, many of the more pacific,and weaker species are studiously guardedby a dense and hard integument, serving as ashield against the attacks of enemies, and oftenarmed with sharp points, which are sufficient torepel the most daring assailant. The Balistesis covered with scales of singular hardnessclosely set together, and frequently havingrough edges. The Ostracism, or trunk fish,instead of these scales, is provided with a kindof coat of mail, composed of osseous plates,curiously joined together, like a tesselated pavement,and reminding us of the arrangementswe have seen adopted in the calcareous coveringsof the echini.Some of the cartilaginous fishes are in likemanner protected by calcareous plates, appendedto the integuments. There is a row of plates ofthis kind, of a quadrangular shape, which passalong the middle of the back in the sturgeon :and the whole body of the Ostracism, or Trunk-fish,is covered with osseous scales. All theseDiodorus AND TETRODONS. 433have no immediate relation to the skeleton, butare apparently remnants of inferior types, ofwhich one of the prevailing characters is theexternal situation of the protecting organs.Diodorus and Tetrodons are remarkable forbeing provided with the means of suddenlyassuming a globular form by swallowing air,which, passing into the crop, or first stomach,blows up the whole animal like a balloon. Theabdominal region being thus rendered thelightest, the body turns over, the stomach becomingthe uppermost part ; and the fish floatsupon its back, without having the power ofdirecting itself during this state of forced distension.But it is while lying thus bloated andpassive at the mercy of the waves, that thisanimal is really most secure ; for the numerousspines, with which the surface of the body isuniversally beset, are raised and erected by thestretching out of the skin, thus presenting anarmed front to the enemy, on whatever side hemay venture to begin the attack.There is a numerous family of fishes, foundin the seas of India, so constructed as to be ablefro crawl on land to some distance from theshore.

Terrestrial Vertebrata in general.The numerous tribes of vertebrated animalswhich are strictly terrestrial, or destined to moveon land, differ widely in their modes of progression,and in the mechanical advantages oftheir formation. The greater number are quadrupeds; some formed for climbing trees, others,for burrowing in the earth ; some for treadingon sandy plains, some for scaling precipices.A few seem scarcely capable of advancing ;others outstrip the winds in fleetness. Somefamilies of reptiles are entirely destitute of anyexternal organs of motion, the whole trunk ofthe body resting on the ground : while man occupiesa place where he stands alone, beingdistinguished by the exclusive faculty of permanentlysustaining himself on the lower extremities.In reviewing the developements and the mechanicalfunctions exhibited by so great a diversityof structures, I shall commence with an examinationof those amphibious reptiles which appear436 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.to form an intermediate link in the chain connectingthe strictly aquatic, with the terrestrialvertebrated animals : then, taking up this latterseries, I shall consider the more simple conformation,and less perfect motions of terrestrialanimals destitute of limbs ; and gradually ascendto those in which the support and progression ofthe body is effected by extremities, more andmore artificially formed : concluding with thehuman structure, which terminates this extensiveseries.§ 2. Brachia.The order of Brachia, or Amphibious Reptiles,constitutes the first step in the transitionfrom aquatic to terrestrial vertebrata. It is moreparticularly the function of respiration that requiresto be modified in consequence of thechange of element in which the animal is to reside;and as if it had been necessary, conformably tothe laws of animal creation, that this changeshould not be abruptly made, we find that Batrachianreptiles, with which this series commences,are constructed at first on the model offishes ; breathing the atmospheric air containedin the water by means of gills, and movingthrough the fluid by the same instruments ofprogression as fishes, which indeed they exactlyBrachia.resemble in every part of their mechanical conformation.The tadpole, which is the young ofthe frog, is at first not distinguishable in anycircumstance of its internal skeleton, or in thedisposition of its vital organs from the classof fishes. The head, indeed, is enlarged, but thebody immediately tapers to form a lengthenedtail, by the prolongation of the spinal column,which presents a numerous series of coccygealvertebrae, furnished with a vertical expansion ofmembrane to serve as a caudal fin, and withappropriate muscles for executing all the motionsrequired in swimming. The appearance of thetadpole in its early stage of development is seenin Fig. 197 and 198, the former being a side,and the latter an upper view of that animal.Yet with all this apparent conformity to thestructure of a strictly aquatic animal, the tadpolecontains within its organization the germs ofa higher development. Preparations are silentlymaking for a change of habitation, for theanimal's emerging from the waters, for the THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.caption of atmospheric air into new cavities, forthe acquisition of limbs suited to new modes ofprogression ; in a word, for a terrestrial life, andfor all the attributes and powers which belong toquadrupeds. The succession of forms, whichthese metamorphoses present, are in themselvesexceedingly curious, and bear a remarkable analogywith the progress of the transformations ofthose insects, which in the first stages of theirexistence are aquatic. To the philosophic inquirerinto the marvellous plans of creation, theseries of changes which mark these singular transitionscannot fail to be deeply interesting ; andoccurring, as we here find them, among a tribeof animals allied to the more perfect forms oforganization, they afford us a better opportunityof exploring the secrets of their developmentby tracing them from the earlier stages of thiscomplicated process so full of mystery and ofwonder.The egg of the frog (Fig. 196) is a roundmass of transparent nutritive belly, in the centreof which appears a small black globule. Bydegrees this shapeless globule exhibits the appearanceof a head and tail, and in this form itemerges from its prison, and moves briskly inthe water. From the sides of the neck theregrow out feathery tufts (Fig. 198, b, b), whichfloat loosely, and without protection, in the surroundingfluid. These, however, are mere tern-developmentOF THE BATRACHIA. 439porary organs, for they serve the purposes ofrespiration only until the proper gills are formed,and they then shrink and become obliterated.The true gills, or franchise, are contained withinthe body, and are four in number on each side,constructed on a plan very similar to those offishes. Retaining this aquatic constitution, thetadpole rapidly increases in size and in activityfor several weeks. In the mean time the legs, ofwhich no trace was at first apparent, havecommenced their growth. The hind legs are thefirst to make their appearance, showing theirembryo forms within the transparent coveringsof the hinder part of the trunk, just at the originof the tail. These are soon succeeded by thefore legs, which exactly follow the hind legs inall the stages of their development, until theyhave acquired their due proportion to the size ofthe trunk. The animal at this period wears avery ambiguous appearance, partaking of theforms both of the frog and of the lizard, andswimming both by the inflexions of the tail, andthe irregular impulses given by the feet. Thisinterval is also employed by this amphibiousbeing, in acquiring the faculty of respiring atmosphericair. We observe it rising every nowand then to the surface, and cultivating itsacquaintance with that element, into which it issoon to be raised ; occasionally taking in amouthful of air, which is received into its newly440 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.developed lungs, and afterwards discharging itin the form of a small bubble. When the necessaryinternal changes are at length completed,preparations are made for getting rid of the tail,which is now a useless member, and which,ceasing to be nourished, diminishes by degrees,leaving only a short stump, which is soon removed.The gills are by this time shrunk, andrapidly disappear, their function being supersededby the lungs, which have been called intoplay ; and the animal now emerges from thewater and begins a new mode of existence, havingbecome a perfect frog (Fig. 199). ' It still, however,retains its aquatic habits, and swims withgreat ease in the water by means of its hindfeet, which are very long and muscular, and ofwhich the toes are furnished with a broad web derivedfrom a thin extension of the integuments.No less curious are the changes which takeplace in all the other organs, for the purpose ofeffecting the transformations rendered necessaryby this entire alteration in all the external circumstancesof that animal, — this total reversalof its wants, of its habits, of its functions, and ofits very constitution. I shall have occasion tonotice several of these transitions when reviewingthe other functions of the animal economy :but at present our concern is chiefly with thestructure of the frame in its mechanical relationsto progressive motion. In order to form a correctidea of these relations it will be necessarySKELETON OF THE BATRACHIA.to notice the leading peculiarities of the skeletonsof this tribe of animals.The skeleton of the adult frog is shown in Fig.200 ; from which it will be seen that the spinalcolumn is comparatively much shorter than thatof fishes, or indeed of any other class of animals ;for it consists of only eight vertebrae, exclusiveof those which have united to form the os cockIt was evidently the intention of natureto consolidate the frame-work of the trunk, inwhich flexibility was not required for progressivemotion : the performance of that function beingtransferred to the hind extremities, which areexceedingly large in proportion to the rest of thebody. There is a tendency in every part of theskeleton to developed itself in a transverse direction,while the trunk is shortened as much aspossible.442 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.The mode in which the vertebrae are articulatedtogether differs widely from what we haveseen in fishes, and approaches to the structure ofthe higher classes of vertebrata. The body ofeach vertebra, instead of having at its posteriorsurface a cup-like cavity, terminates by a projectingball, which is received into the cavity inthe anterior surface of the next vertebra, so asto compose a true ball and socket joint, capable,when other circumstances permit, of a rotatorymotion. But the vertebrae of the tadpole, as wehave seen, are constructed on the model of thoseof a fish ; that is, have cup-like cavities on boththeir surfaces, which play on balls of soft elasticmatter interposed between them. We shouldnaturally be curious to learn the mode in whichthe transition from this structure to that of thefrog is accomplished. By carefully watchingthe progress of ossification, while this change istaking place, Dutrochet found that the gelatinousball, on which both the adjacent vertebrae playin the tadpole, becomes gradually more solid,and is converted into cartilage. This cartilageafterwards becomes united by its anterior surfaceto the vertebra which is in front of it ; and thewhole then becomes ossified, so as to composeonly one bone, its posterior surface remainingdistinct, and continuing to play within the cup-likehollow of the vertebra which is behind it.The cartilaginous coccygeal vertebrae of the tad-skeletonOF THE BATRACHIA. 443pole are lost long before there is time for theirbeing ossified ; but those nearest to the body areconsolidated into one long and straight os coccy-gis, which being joined to the sacrum at an angle,gives rise to the strange deformity observable atthat part of the back of a frog ; for it here looksas if it had been broken. The spinal cavity isat the same time obliterated, that portion ofthe spinal marrow which had passed through itin the aquatic life of the animal being now withdrawn.The theory of the spinal origin of the cranialbones receives considerable support from theirstructure and relative position in the skeletonof the frog. The cavity for the lodgement ofthe brain, which is enclosed by these vertebrae,is perfectly continuous in the same line withthe spinal canal, which, indeed, it scarcelyexceeds in its diameter. The bones of the faceare, at the same time, expanded laterally, soas to bear no proportion to the cranial cavity.The head plays on the vertebral column by twolateral articular surfaces, formed upon the rootof each leaf of the occipital bone, while its body,or basilar portion, is scarcely connected withthe first cervical vertebra, and has no articularsurface.In place of ribs, we find only small slenderdetached bones, or rather cartilages, affixed to theextremities of the transverse processes of some444 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.of the vertebrae. They may be regarded asrudimental ribs.*The pelvis consists of two slender and elongatediliac bones, which are extended backwards,and which, at their anterior extremities, merelytouch the points of the transverse processes of thelast vertebra of the back. This vertebra is muchbroader than the rest, and although it consistsbut of a single vertebra, must be considered as asacrum. The two pubic and ischiatic bones areexceedingly small, but still contribute to form theacetabulum, or cavity for the reception of thethigh bone, at the hinder extremity of the slenderbones above mentioned. This is the simplestpossible form to which the pelvis can be reduced,while it preserves its attachments to the spine.It presents in this respect a more advanced stageof development than that of fishes.The connexion of the bones of the anteriorextremities with the spine is analogous to thatwhich takes place in rays and sharks : therebeing an osseous belt formed by the scapula,clavicle, and coracoid bone, with the latter ofwhich the humerus is connected. The sternumThe plan of reproduction in these animals requires that theovary, or organ which contains the eggs, should be capable ofenormous dilatation, in order to contain the immense bulk towhich these eggs are expanded, previous to their being broughtforth. It was probably in order to make room for this dilatedovary that the ribs have not been developed.PROGRESSIVE MOTION IN BATRACHIA. 445is large, and considerably developed ; makingsome slight approach to the expansion it receivesin the Chelonia. The radius and ulna are unitedinto one bone : the bones of the arm and leg ingeneral resemble in their figure and connexionsthose of the higher orders of Mammalia, to thetype of which this order of reptiles is evidentlymaking an approximation. There are five toesin the foot, with sometimes the rudiment of asixth : the anterior extremity has only four toes,which are without claws.The necessity of employing the same instrumentsfor progression in the water and on land, isprobably the cause which prevents their havingthe form best adapted for either function. Thehind feet of the frog, being well constructed forstriking the water backwards in swimming, are,in consequence, less capable of exerting a forcesufficient to raise and support the weight of thebody in walking : and this animal accordinglyis exceedingly awkward in its attempt to walk.On a short level plane it can proceed only byleaps ; an action which the length and greatmuscularity of the hind legs particularly fitthem for performing. The toad, on the otherhand, whose hind legs are short and feeble, walksbetter, but does not jump or swim so well as thefrog.* The Hyla, or tree-frog, has the extremitiesIt is singular that the frog, though so low in the scale ofvertebrated animals, should bear a striking resemblance to the446 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.of each of its toes expanded into a fleshy tubercle,approaching in the form of its concave surfaceto that of a sucker, and by the aid of which itfastens itself readily to the branches of trees,which it chiefly inhabits, and along which it runswith great agility.The Salamander is an animal of the same classas the frog, undergoing the same metamorphosesfrom the tadpole state. It differs much, however,in respect to the development of particular partsof the skeleton. The anterior extremities of thesalamander make their appearance earlier thanthe hind legs, and the tail remains as a permanentpart of the structure. The rudimental ribsare exceedingly small, and the sternum continuescartilaginous. The pelvis has no osseous connexionwith the spine, but is merely suspendedto it by ligaments. The land salamanders havea rounded tail, but the aquatic species, or Tritons,have it compressed vertically ; thus retainingthe fish-like form of the tadpole, and the sameradiated disposition of the muscles.human conformation in its organs of progressive motion. Thisarises from the exertions which it makes in swimming beingsimilar to those of man in walking, in as far as they both resultfrom the strong action of the extensors of the feet. Hence wefind a distinct calf in the legs of both, produced by the swellingof similar muscles. The muscles of the thigh present, also, manyanalogies with those of man ; particularly in the presence of thelong muscle called the sartorius, the use of which is to turn thefoot outwards, both in stepping and in swimming.SERPENTS. 447§ 3. Ophidia.In the class of serpents we see exemplified thegreatest possible state of simplicity to which avertebrated skeleton can be reduced ; for, as maybeseen in Fig. 201, which shows the skeletonof a viper, it consists merely of a lengthenedspinal column, with a head but little developed,and a series of ribs ; but apparently destitute oflimbs, and of the bones which usually connectthose limbs with the trunk ; there being neithersternum, nor scapula, nor pelvis.* In the con-professorMayer has, however, traced obscure rudiments ofI pelvic bones in the Anguis fragilis, the Anguis ventral, andthe Typhlops cristatus, and is of opinion that they existI much more generally in this order of reptiles, than has beencommonly imagined. Some serpents, as the Boa, Python, Tor-tryand Eryx, have claws, which may be considered as rudimentsof feet, visible externally. In others, as the Anguis, Typh-lops, and Amphisbcena, they exist concealed under the skin.48 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.formation of the skull and bones of the face,they present strong analogies with batrachianreptiles, and also with fishes, one tribe of which,namely, the amorous or anguilliform fishes,they greatly resemble by the length and flexibilityof the spine. These peculiarities of conformationmay be in a great measure traced tothe mode of life for which they are destined.In others, he has discovered cartilaginous filaments, which heconceives to correspond to these parts. (Annales des SciencesNaturelles, VII. 170.) Some of these are represented in thefollowing figures. Fig. 203 exhibits the claw of the Boa constrictor,placed at the termination of a series of bones, representingvery imperfectly the bones of the lower extremities. Fig.204 shows the muscles attached to these small bones. The threefollowing figures, 205, 206, and 207, represent the claws andrudimental bones of the Tortrix scythe, Tortrix coralline, andAnguisfragilis, respectively. Those of the Amphisbeena alba,Fig. 208, and the Coluber pullets, Fig. 209, are still less developed.The Chalcides, or snake lizard, which has four minutefeet, is represented in Fig. 210.SERPENTS. 449The food assigned to them is living prey, whichthey must attack and vanquish before they canconvert it into nourishment. The usual modein which the boa seizes and destroys its victimsis by coiling the hinder part of its body roundthe trunk or branch of a tree, keeping the headand anterior half of the body disengaged ; andthen, by a sudden spring, fastening upon thedefenceless object of its attack, and twining roundits body, so as to compress its chest, and put astop to its respiration. Venomous serpents, onthe other hand, coil themselves into the smallestpossible space, and suddenly darting upon theunsuspecting or fascinated straggler, inflict thequickly fatal wound.*It is evident, from these considerations, that,in the absence of all external instruments ofprehension and of progressive motion, it is necessarythat the spine should be rendered extremelyflexible, so as to adapt itself to a great variety ofmovements. This extraordinary flexibility isgiven, first, by the subdivision of the spinalcolumn into a great number of small pieces ; secondly,by the great freedom of their articulations; and thirdly, by the peculiar mobilityand connexions of the ribs.Their prey is swallowed entire ; and therefore, as we shallafterwards find, the bones of the jaws and face are formed toadmit of great expansion, and of great freedom of motion uponone another.VOL. I. G GTHE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.Numerous as are the vertebrae of the eel, thespine of which consists of above a hundred, thatof serpents is in general formed of a still greaternumber. In the rattle-snake (Crotalus horrid)there are about two hundred ; and above threehundred have been counted in the spine of theColuber matrix. These vertebrae are all unitedby ball and socket joints,as in the adult brachia ;the posterior rounded eminenceof each vertebrabeing received into theanterior surface of thenext. Fig. 202 is a viewof this portion of the skeletonin the Boa constrictor,showing the articulationof the ribs withthe vertebrae.While provision has thus been made for extentof motion, extraordinary care has at the sametime been bestowed upon the security of thejoints. Thus we find them effectually protectedfrom dislocation by the locking in, above andbelow, of the articular processes, and by theclose investment of the capsular ligaments. Thedirection of the surfaces of these processes, andthe shape and length of the spinous processes,are such as to allow of free lateral flexion, but tolimit the vertical and longitudinal motions : andSERPENTS. 4->1whatever degree of freedom of motion may existbetween the adjoining vertebrae, that motionbeing multiplied along the column, the flexibilityof the whole becomes very great, and admits ofits assuming every degree and variety of curvature.The presence of a sternum, restrainingthe motions of the ribs, would have impeded allthese movements, and would have also been aninsurmountable bar to the dilatation of the stomach,which is rendered necessary by the habitof the serpent of gorging its prey entire.The mode in which the boa exerts a powerfulpressure on the bodies of the animals it hasseized, and which it has encircled within itsfolds, required the ribs to be moveable laterally,as well as backwards, in order to elude the forcethus exerted. The broad convex surfaces onwhich they play give them, in this respect, anadvantage which the ordinary mode of articulationwould not have afforded. The spinous processesin this tribe of serpents are short andwidely separated, so as to allow of flexion inevery direction. In the rattle-snake, on theother hand, their length and oblique position aresuch as to limit the upward bending of the spinalcolumn, although, in other respects, its motion isnot restricted. The vertebrae at the end of thetail are furnished with broad transverse processesfor the attachment of the first joints of the rattle.But of whatever variety of flexions we may452 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.suppose the lengthened body of a serpent to becapable, it will, at first view, be difficult to conceivehow these simple actions can be renderedsubservient to the purposes of progression on land :and yet experience teaches us that few animalsadvance with more celerity on the surface of theground, or dart upon their prey with greaterpromptitude and precision. They raise themselveswithout difficulty to the tops of the highesttrees, and escape to their hiding places with aquickness which eludes observation and bafflesthe efforts of their pursuers.The solution of this enigma is to be sought forpartly in the structure of the skin, which, inalmost every species, is covered with numerousscales : and partly in the peculiar conformationof the ribs. The edges of the scales form roughprojections, which are directed backwards, so asto catch the surfaces of the bodies to which theyare applied, and to prevent any retrograde motion.In some species, the integument is formedinto annular plates, reminding us of the structuresso prevalent among worms and myriapodeanimals. Each scale is connected with a particularset of muscular fibres, capable of raisingor depressing it, so that in this way it is convertedinto a kind of toe ; and thus the bodyrests upon the ground by numerous fixed pointsof support.This support is further strengthened by thePROGRESSIVE MOTION IN SERPENTS. 453connexion of the ribs with the abdominal scuta,or the scales on the under side of the body. Themode in which the ribs become auxiliary instrumentsof progressive motion was first noticed bySir Joseph Banks.* Whilst he was watchingthe movements of a Coluber of unusual sizewhich was exhibited in London, and wasmoving briskly along the carpet, he thought hesaw the ribs come forward in succession, likethe feet of a caterpillar. Sir Everard Home, towhom Sir Joseph Banks pointed out this circumstance,verified the fact by applying his handbelow the serpent, and he then distinctly feltthe ends of the ribs moving upon the palm, asthe animal passed over it. The mode in whichthe ribs are articulated with the spine is peculiar,and has evidently been employed with referenceto this particular function of the ribs,which here stand in place of the anterior andposterior extremities, possessed by most vertebratedanimals, and characterising the type oftheir osseous fabric. In the ordinary structure ?the head of each rib has a convex surface, thatplays either on the body of a single vertebrawith which it is connected, or upon the twobodies of adjacent vertebrae : but in serpents theextremity of the head of the rib has two slightlyconcave articular surfaces, which play on aPhilos.

Thisstructure is attended with the advantage ofpreventing the ribs from interfering with themotions of the vertebrae upon one another. Attheir lower ends the ribs of one side have noconnexion with those of the other, nor are theyjoined to any bone analogous to a sternum :for, except in the Ophiosauras and the Blind-worm(Augurs fragilis), there is no vestigeeither of a sternum or scapula, in any animalof this class. Each rib terminates in a slendercartilage, tapering to a point, which rests, for itswhole length, upon the upper surface of oneof the scuta, or broad scales on the lower side ofthe body. These scuta, which are thus connectedwith the ends of the ribs, and which aremoved by means of short muscles, may be comparedto hoofs, while the ribs themselves maybeconsidered as performing the office of legs.The ribs move in pairs ; and the scutum undereach pair, being carried along with it in all itsmotions, and laying hold of the ground by itsprojecting edge, becomes a fixed point for theadvance of the body. This motion, Sir E.Home observes, is beautifully seen when asnake is climbing over an angle to get upon aflat surface. When the animal is moving on aplane, it alters its shape from a circular or ovalform, to one that approaches to a triangle, ofwhich the surface applied to the ground formsPROGRESSIVE MOTION IN SERPENTS. 455the base. Five sets of muscles are provided forthe purpose of giving to the ribs the motionsbackwards and forwards, by which, as levers,they effect this species of progression. Thesemuscles are disposed in regular layers; somepassing over one or two ribs to be attached tothe succeeding rib. In all snakes the ribs arecontinued backwards much beyond the regionoccupied by the lungs ; and although the anteriorset are subservient to respiration, as well asto progressive motion, it is evident that all thoseposterior to the lungs must be employed solelyfor the latter of these purposes.It is easy to understand how the serpent canslowly advance, by this creeping, or vermicularmotion, consisting in reality of a succession ofvery short steps! But its progress is acceleratedby the curvatures into which it throws its body ;the fore part being fixed, and the hind partbrought near to it ; then, by a reverse process,the hind part is fixed, and the head projectedforwards. By an alternation of these movements,assisted by the actions of the ribs, theserpent is enabled to glide onwards with considerablerapidity, and without attracting observation.But where greater expedition is necessary,they employ a more hurried kind of pace,although one which exposes them more to immediateview. The body, instead of being bentfrom side to side, is raised in one great arch,456* THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.of which the two extremities alone touch theground; and these being alternately employedas points of support, are made successively toapproach and to separate from each other, thebody being propelled by bringing it from acurved to a straight line.There is yet a third kind of motion, whichserpents occasionally resort to, when springingupon their prey, or when desirous of making asudden escape from danger. They coil themselvesinto a spiral, by contracting all themuscles on one side of the body, and then,suddenly throwing into violent action all themuscles on the opposite side, the whole body ispropelled, as if by the release and unwinding ofa powerful spring, with an impulse which raisesit to some height from the ground, and projectsit to a considerable distance.Thus these animals, to which Nature hasdenied all external members, are yet capable,by the substitution of a different kind of mechanism,still constructed from the elementsbelonging to the primitive type of vertebratedanimals, of silently gliding along the surface ofthe earth, of creeping up trees, of striding rapidlyacross the plain, and of executing leapswith a vigour and agility which astonish thebeholder, and which, in ages of ignorance andsuperstition, were easily ascribed to supernaturalagency.SAURIAN REPTILES. 457§ 4. Sauria.The conformation of those parts of the framewhich are subservient to progressive motionbecomes more perfect in the class of Saurianreptiles, which includes all the Lizard tribes.Several links of connexion with the precedingclass may still be noticed, marking the progressof development, as we follow the ascendingseries of animals. Rudiments of the bones ofthe extremities, and also of the sternum maketheir appearance very visibly in the Ophiosaurus,and in the blind worm (Anguis fragilis). TheSiren lacerta has two diminutive fore feet,placed close to the head. The Lacerta umbriaof Linnaeus, or the Pipes canaliculatus ofLacepede, which is found in Mexico, and ofwhich a specimen is preserved in the collectionat Paris, has a pair of very short feet, also placednear the head, and divided into four toes, withthe rudiment of a fifth. The Lacerta pipes(Linn), or Sheltopusic of Pallas, has, on theother hand, a pair of hind feet only, but extremelysmall, together with rudiments of ascapula and clavicle concealed under the skin.Next in order must be placed the Chalcides,or Snake-lizard (Fig. 210), and the Lacerta458 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.seps, animals frequently met with in the Southof France, and which have four minute feet,totally inefficient for the support of the body,and only remotely useful in contributing to itsprogressive undulations.Ascending from these, we may form a series ofreptiles, in which the development of the limbsbecomes more and more extended, till we arriveat Crocodiles, in which they attain a considerabledegree of perfection. As a consequence ofthis greater development of the skeleton, wefind the trunk divisible into separate regions.We now, for the first time, meet with a distinctneck, separating the head from the thorax,which is itself distinguishable from the abdomen ;and a distinct sacrum is interposed between thelumbar and the caudal vertebrae.A further approach to the higher classes, isobservable in the number of cervical vertebrae,which is almost constantly seven ; as we shallfind it to be in the mammalia. The articulationsof the vertebrae are similar to those ofserpents, inasmuch as they consist of ball andsocket joints. In that of the occipital bone withthe first vertebra of the neck, we find thatnature again reverts to the simpler form of asingle condyle projecting from the body of theoccipital bone, instead of lateral condyles proceedingfrom its leaves, as we noticed was theSAURIAN REPTILES. 459structure in the brachia. The caudal vertebraeare always numerous, and the tail is compressedvertically, which is the form mostfavourable for progression in water. They areremarkable also for having inferior spinous processesattached to the bodies by cartilages ; astructure analogous to that which we have seenin fishes.The number of ribs differs in different speciesof Sauria : they are always articulated to the extremitiesof the transverse processes of the vertebrae,of which they appear to be continuations.Processes of this description also occur in theneck, attached to the transverse processes of thecervical vertebrae ; and these have been regardedas cervical ribs. Their presence are impedimentsto the flexions of the neck ; whencearises the difficulty which the crocodile appearsto have in bending the neck while turninground upon the animal he is pursuing. In thethorax, the ribs are connected with a broadsternum ; but there are other ribs, both beforeand behind, which have no such termination,and therefore bear the name of false ribs.The pelvis consists chiefly of the iliac bones,which, as in the brachia, pass backwards toform the articular cavity for the thigh bone.Two small and slender bones extend forwardsfrom the pubic bones, on the under side of the460 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.body, apparently for the purpose of supportingthe abdominal viscera.* The bones of the extremitiesare very perfectly formed, approachingin their shape and arrangement very nearly tothe corresponding parts of the skeleton of thehigher orders of quadrupeds. The toes areusually provided with membranes spread betweenthem, to assist in swimming. The formof the tail, which is generally compressed vertically,like that of fishes, though perhaps not toan equal degree, is another indication of theirbeing formed for an aquatic life : for where thetail has this shape, we always find that thechief muscular power is bestowed upon it as aninstrument of aquatic progression, producing, byits lateral flexions, a horizontal movement of thebody. Crocodiles and alligators, for instance,which have this conformation, are comparativelyweak when on land, and as soon as they haveseized their prey, their efforts are always directedto drag it with them into the water; knowingthat when in their own element they can readilymaster its struggles, and dispose of it as theyplease.In the Gecko tribe, we find a particular mechanismprovided for effecting the adhesion ofthe feet to the objects to which they are applied.They appear to be analogous to the marsupial bones peculiarto a family of mammalia.FEET OF THE GECKO.It is somewhat analogous to that employed inthe case of the house-fly, already mentioned.Each foot has five toes ; all, except the thumb,terminated by a sharp curved claw. On theunder surface of each toe (represented in Fig.211) there are as many as sixteen transverseslits, leading to the same number of cavities, orsacs; these open forwards,and their externaledge is serratedappearing like the teethof a small-toothed comb.A section of the foot,showing these cavities,is seen in Fig. 212. Allthese parts, togetherwith the cavities, arecovered or lined withcuticle. Below themare large muscles which draw down the claw ;and from the tendons of these muscles arise twosets of smaller muscles, situated so as to be putupon the stretch, when the former are in action.By the contractions of these muscles, the orificesof the cavities, or sacs, to which they belong,are opened, and the serrated edges applied accuratelyto the surfaces with which the feet arein contact. Sir Everard Home, in his accountof this structure, compares it to the sucking disk40*2 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.of the Remora* By its means the animal isenabled to walk securely upon the smoothestsurfaces, even in opposition to the tendency ofgravity. It can run very quickly along thewalls or ceiling of a building, in situations whereit cannot be supported by the feet, but mustdepend altogether upon the suspension derivedfrom a succession of rapid and momentary adhesions.Although the Sauria are better formed forprogressive motion than any of the other ordersof reptiles, yet the greater shortness and obliqueposition of their limbs, compared with those ofmammiferous quadrupeds, obliges them in generalto rest the weight of the trunk of the bodyon the ground, when they are not actuallymoving. None of these reptiles have any otherkind of pace than that of walking, or jumping;being incapable of performing either a trot or agallop, in consequence of the obliquity of theplane in which their limbs move. The Chameleonwalks with great slowness and apparentdifficulty; and we have seen that, in consequenceof the structure of the bones of itsneck, the Crocodile, though capable of swift motionin a straight line, is unable to turn itselfround quickly. The general type of these reptiles,having reference to an amphibious life, hasPhilosophical Transactions for 1816, p. 151, and 323.CHELONIAN REPTILES. 463not attained that exclusive adaptation to a terrestrialexistence, which we find in the higherorders of the Mammalia. But before proceedingto consider these, we have to notice a singulargroup of animals, whose conformationappears to be exceedingly anomalous, and as ifit interrupted the regularity of the ascendingseries, of which it seems to be a collateral ramification.§ 5. Chelonia.The order of Chelonian Reptiles, which comprisesall the tribes of Tortoises and Turtles,appears to constitute an exception to the generallaws of conformation, which prevail among VertebratedAnimals : for instead of presenting askeleton wholly internal, the trunk of the bodyis found to be enclosed on every side in a bonycase, which leaves openings only for the head,the tail, and the fore and hind extremities.That portion of this osseous expansion whichcovers the back is termed the Carapace; andthe flat plate which defends the lower part ofthe body is termed the plastron. It is a form ofstructure that reminds us of the defence providedfor animals very low in the scale of organization,such as the echinus, the Crustacea,and the bivalve mollusca. Yet the substance464 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.which forms these strong bucklers, both aboveand below, is a real osseous structure, developedin the same manner as" other bones, subject toall the changes, and having all the propertiesof these structures. The great purpose whichnature seems to have had in view in the formationof the Chelonia is security ; and for theattainment of this object she has constructed avaulted and impenetrable roof, capable of resistingenormous pressures from without, andproof against any ordinary measures of assault.It is to the animal a strong castle, into whichhe can retire on the least alarm, and defy theefforts of his enemies to dislodge or annoy him.These considerations supply us with a key tomany of those apparent anomalies, which cannotfail to strike us in viewing the dispositions ofthe parts of the skeleton (Fig. 213), and the remarkableinversion they appear to have undergone,when compared with the usual arrangement.We find, however, on a more attentiveexamination, that all the bones composing theskeleton in other vertebrated animals exist alsoin the tortoise; and that the bony case whichenvelopes all the other parts is really formed byan extension of the spinous processes of the vertebraeand ribs on the one side, and of the usualpieces which compose the sternum on the other.The upper and lower plates thus formed areunited at their edges by expansions of the REPTILES. 405costal appendices, which become ossified. Thusno new element has been created ; but advantagehas been taken of those already existing in thegeneral type of the vertebrata, to modify theirforms, by giving them different degrees of relativedevelopment, and converting them, by thesetransformations, into a mechanism of a very differentkind, and subservient to other objectsthan those to which they are usually applied.It is scarcely possible to have stronger proofs, ifsuch were wanting, of the unity of plan whichhas regulated the formation of all animal struckI.H H466 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.turns, than those afforded by the skeleton of thetortoise.The first step taken to secure the relativeimmobility of the trunk, is to unite in one rigidbony column all its vertebrae, and to allow ofmotion only in those of the neck, and of the tail.The former, accordingly, are all anchylosed together,leaving, indeed, traces of their originalforms as separate vertebras, but exhibiting nosutures at the place of junction. The canal forthe spinal marrow is preserved, as usual, abovethe bodies of these coalesced vertebras, and isformed by their united leaves ; the arches beingcompleted by the spinous processes. But theseprocesses do not terminate in a crest as usual ;they are further expanded in a lateral direction,forming flat pieces along the back, which areunited to one another by sutures, and which arealso joined to the expanded ribs, so as to form thecontinuous plane surface of the carapace. Thetransverse processes of the vertebrae are wellmarked, but, though firmly united to the ribs,do not give rise to them ; for the ribs, which areflattened and expanded, so as to touch one anotheralong their whole length, are inserted below,between the bodies of every two adjoining vertebrae; while above, they are united by suturewith the plates of the spinous processes. Thischange in the situation of the ribs is the consequenceof the change in their office. WhenCHELONIAN REPTILES. 467designed to be very moveable, we find themattached either to the extremities of the transverseprocesses, or to the articular surfaces of a singlevertebra ; but where solidity and security areaimed at, they are always, inserted between thebodies of two vertebra?. This we shall find tobe the case also in birds, where the bones of thethorax are required to be immovable. It is remarkable,indeed, that a great number of thepeculiarities which distinguish the conformationof the chelonia from that of other reptiles, indicatean approach to the structure of birds ; as ifnature had intended this small group of animalsto be an intermediate link of gradation to thatnew and important type of animals destined foravery different mode of existence.The sterno-costal appendages, which connectthe ribs to the sternum, are, in most animals,cartilaginous ; though occasionally we find thempartially ossified. In the tortoise, however, theirossification is not only complete, but has beenexpanded laterally, so as to form a continuoussurface with the extremities of the ribs and withthe edges of the plastron, and completely to fillup the vacancy between them ; constituting adense and solid wall, which entirely closes thesides of the general bony case. So strong is thetendency to ossification in all these pieces, thatthe sutures at first formed between them areoften, in process of time, obliterated ; and the468 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.bony fibres are continuous throughout a greatextent of surface.The most remarkable metamorphosis in theosseous system of this new type is that whichoccurs in the sternum. So expanded are all itsparts, that it is difficult to recognise this boneunder the disguised form in which it constitutesthe plastron, or broad plate, which, as we haveseen, covers the whole of the under side of thebody. Yet, by a careful examination of itsstructure, both in the young animal, and also inthe adult, when the sutures are not obliterated,we may easily recognise the nine elements ofthe sternum ; namely, the one in the middle andfore part, and the four pair of lateral pieces ;each having been formed from its respectivecentre of ossification. In form and relativeproportion, indeed, they are widely differentfrom the same parts as they are presented in theskeletons of other animals : yet in number andin relative situations they preserve that constancyand uniformity so characteristic of thebeautiful harmony which pervades all animalstructures.It is to be noticed, also, that as the plates,which form this investing case, are bony structures,they could not with any safety have beenexposed to the action of the atmosphere. Hencewe find them covered throughout with a thinhorny plate, originally a production of the interREPTILES. 469argument. It is this substance which is commonlyknown by the name of tortoise shell.*The immobility of the trunk is compensated,as far as regards the safety of the head, by thegreat flexibility of the neck ; which is composedof seven vertebra?, unencumbered by processes,and capable of taking a double curvature likethe letter S, when the head is to be retractedwithin the carapace. These vertebrae are joinedby the ball and socket articulation common toall the existing species of reptiles. f The articulationof the head with the neck is effected inthe same manner ; but it is interesting to remarkthat the occipital condyle, which is situated atthe lower margin of the great aperture, thoughpresenting a single convex surface, yet has thatsurface evidently dividedinto three parts ; the twoupper portions being late~V^li3S!!lK J J ra l> an ^ the lower portion inthe middle. These threearticular surfaces are seenimmediately below the central aperture, f, in Fig.It should be observed, that the divisions of these plates,which appear externally, bear no relation to the sutures whichseparate the subjacent bones, so that it is not possible to drawinferences respecting the form of the latter from the mere inspectionof the external shell.f The expression of this fact is thus qualified, because it doesnot apply to many fossil or extinct species, such as the Ichthyosaurus.470 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.215,which exhibits the skull of the Testudo my cas,viewed from behind. Although closely approximated,a faint line of demarcation, which dividestheir surface, indicates an incipient tendency toseparate ; we shall find that in the further stepsof development which occur in the higher classes,this separation actually takes place by the obliterationof the lower articular surface, and thetransfer of the two lateral surfaces to the condyloidprocesses arising from the developmentof the leaves of the occipital bone.The singular conformation of the bones of thehead in the turtle affords fresh evidence in supportof the theory that these bones were originallyvertebras. The brain of the tortoise isexceedingly small ; and yet the skull, whenviewed from above, presents an appearance ofgreat breadth, as if it enclosed a cavity oflarge dimensions. But if we look upon it frombehind, as is shown in Fig. 21 5, we soon discoverthat the real cavity in which the brain is lodged,and to which the aperture at f leads, is verysmall, only just admitting the end of the finger,and that the broad plates of bone, p, p, whichform the upper surface of the skull, have norelation to this cavity, and are merely extendedover the temporal muscles, which are of verylarge size, occupying the whole of the spaces,s, s ; which spaces are completely surroundedby these bones. It would appear that the same(Devonian REPTILES. 471tendency to lateral expansion, which exists inthe spinous processes of the dorsal vertebrae,prevails also among those which contribute toform the skull. The parietal bones, which representthe spinous processes of the secondcranial vertebra, after having performed theirprimary office of protecting the hemispheres ofthe brain by closing over them, still proceed intheir development, forming first a crest on theupper part of the real cranium, and then separatingto the right and left, and expanding horizontallyinto the upper roof (p, p) already mentioned,for the protection of the temporal muscles •This great breadth of the head in the turtle givesthe animal an aspect of superior intelligence, towhich character, from the really diminutive sizeof its brain, it is in no respect entitled. As. theturtle is unable to withdraw its head within thecarapace, such extraordinary protection appearsto have been necessary : for it is not met withinthe tortoise, which has a carapace sufficientlycapacious to give shelter to the head wheneveroccasion may require.*This arrangement of the expanded spinousprocesses and ribs gives rise to a singular inversionin the position of the scapula ; for it is hereThe analogy of the spine of the occipital bone with that ofa vertebra is further shown by this bone extending backwards toa considerable length, exactly in the manner of the spinous processesof the cervical vertebrae in other animals.472 THE Mechanical FUNCTIONS.placed on the inside of the ribs and sternum,that is, between the carapace and plastron.*The humerus is remarkably curved, especiallyin the tortoise, where it has the form nearly ofa semi-circle. The radius and ulna are distinctfrom each other ; the carpus and phalangesare short and stunted, forming a compressedkind of hand.The pelvis, like the scapula and clavicle, isenclosed within the bony shell which protectsthe trunk. The sacrum is moveable upon thelast dorsal vertebra ; and the coccygeal vertebra?are continued from it, forming a short tail. Thefemur is short and powerful, and somewhat bent,but less so than the humerus; and the rest ofthe bones of the hind extremity are similar tothose of the fore legs All the feet are joinedobliquely to the limbs which support them,giving the animal an apparent awkwardnessof gait, as if it were obliged to walk upon clubThe anomalous situation of these bones, and the strangelydisguised forms which their several parts assume, render it verydifficult to recognise in the skeleton the several pieces whichcorrespond to the normal type of the scapula, acromion, coracoidbone, and clavicle ; and anatomists are not yet agreed asto the proper designations which are applicable to these bonesin the Chelonia.t The cylindrical bones of the tortoise are solid throughout,and have no cavity for containing marrow, as in the more highlydeveloped bones of the mammalia. This is seen in the sectionof the femur, Fig. 214.CHELONIAN REPTILES. 473feet. The impulse which they give being lateraland oblique renders them more efficacious forprogression in the water than on land : thiscircumstance, in conjunction with the constitutionaltorpor of the animal, sufficiently accountsfor the excessive, and indeed proverbial tardinessof its movements.Security appears still to be the object aimedat in the mechanism of all the other parts of theskeleton. The articulations at the shoulders andthe hips are such as facilitate the completeretraction of the limbs within the carapace.After the head has been drawn in by the double,or serpentine flexion of the neck, the knees arebrought together, and the whole limb withdrawnwithin the shell, the fore legs folding completelyover the head, so as to cover and protect it mosteffectually. For this purpose, the carpus andmetacarpus are exceedingly flattened, and approximateto the fin-like form which we shallpresently see exemplified in the cetaceous tribes.The phalanges are also large and lengthened,forming a kind of oval hand, or rather paddle,the functions of which it is well calculated toperform. The curvature of the humerus is ofgreat advantage to the tortoise in assisting it toturn itself, when, by any accident, it has beenlaid on its back.Considerable differences may be noticed inthe structure of the several species of Chelonia,474 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.according to the diversity" of their habits. Tortoiseswhich live on land, require more completeprotection by means of their shell thanturtles, or Emydes, which dwell only in thewater: hence the convexity of their carapace,the solidity of its ossification, its immoveableconnexion with the plastron, and the completeshelter it affords to the head and limbs. Turtles,on the other hand, receiving support from theelement in which they reside, require less provisionto be made for these objects. Their carapaceis smaller, has a more flattened form,and cannot afford protection to the head andlimbs. These latter organs are proportionallylarger, present a greater development of theradius and ulna, and are compressed into a flatexpanded surface. Previously to the retractionof the head and limbs within the shell, the air isexpelled from the large cavities of the lungs, bythe vigorous actions of the abdominal muscles,which exist in these animals as well as in all thevertebrata, although here they are covered bythe bones, and compress the lungs by pushingthe abdominal viscera against them. This suddenexpulsion of air is the cause of the longcontinued hissing sound which the tortoise emitswhile preparing to retreat into its strong hold.The ribs, though they at first assume the formof broad plates immoveable united to the spine,when they have proceeded a certain distance,CHELONIAN REPTILES. 47»5separate from each other, and resume their usualform ; the intervening spaces between two adjacentribs being here filled up by membrane.The plastron is united with the carapace bymembrane likewise ; and the sternum, insteadof forming one broad plate of bone, has the intervalsbetween its imperfectly developed elementsalso membranous. All this renders thewhole shell less compact, more flexible, andmore feeble : but the movements of the animalare quicker and more energetic.These characteristic differences between theaquatic Chelonia and those that live on land arestill more strongly marked in the genus Trionyx,or soft tortoise ; which is destitute of scales, andin which many of the pieces that are bony inthe tortoise are replaced by simple cartilage ormembrane.The enormous weight of the shell of the turtlewould be a serious impediment to the motion ofthis animal in the water, were there not someprovision made for diminishing the specific gravityin the body. This purpose is answered bythe great capacity of the lungs, which, wheninflated with air, nearly fill the thorax, andgive great buoyancy to the whole mass. Thus,wherever there exists a supposed inconvenience,dependent on the fulfilment of one condition,we are certain to meet with a compensationin the structure of some other part, and in476 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.the mode of executing some other function.An express provision for giving buoyancy hasbeen made in the construction of the shell of aspecies of tortoise inhabiting the coasts of theScychelle Islands. The under surface of theshell, instead of being gently concave, as in landtortoises, has a deep circular concavity in thecentre, above four inches in depth, which, whenthe animal goes into the water, retains a largevolume of air, buoying up the whole mass whileit remains in that element.* The greater size ofturtles, when compared with tortoises, is a fartherinstance of the superior facility with whichorganic growth proceeds in aquatic than in landanimals formed on the same model of construction.Home's Lectures, vi. 37.Chapter IX.MAMMALIA.§ 1 . Mammalia in general.The singular animals, so remarkable for theiranomalous shapes, their torpid vitality, and theiramphibious constitution, which have lately occupiedour attention, appear placed by natureas forms of transition, in the passage from thosevertebrated animals which dwell in the water,to those which inhabit the land. The classof Mammifera, or Mammalia, comprehends allthe animals which possess a spinal column,breathe air by means of lungs, and are alsowarm blooded, and viviparous, conditions whichrender it necessary that they should possessorgans, called mamma, endowed with the powerof preparing milk for the nourishment of theiryoung ; a peculiarity from which the name ofthe class is derived. But they are not exclusivelyland animals ; for among the mammaliamust be ranked several amphibious and aquatictribes, such as the seal, the walrus, the corpus,478 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.the dolphin, the narwal, the cachalot, and thewhale ; animals which, however widely theymay differ in their habits and external conformationfrom terrestrial quadrupeds, possess,in common with the latter, all the essentialcharacters of internal structure and of functionsabove enumerated. These characters belongalso to the human species, which must consequently,in its zoological relations, be rankedas a genus of the class mammalia. So numerous,indeed, are the analogies which connect the naturalfamilies of this class with our own race, thatwe must ever feel a deep interest in the accurateinvestigation of their comparative anatomy andphysiology ; and it has been found, accordingly,that the progress which has, of late years, beenmade in this branch of science has materiallyenlarged our knowledge of the structure, thefunctions, and the physical history of man :subjects with which our welfare has obviouslythe closest and most intimate relation.The principle of analogy, which prevails sogenerally in the inferior departments of the animalcreation, may be also traced in the classmammalia ; for we always find its influencemore conspicuous in proportion as the objectscomprehended in the natural series of beings aremore numerous and more diversified. Scarcelyany of the great natural assemblages of animalsMAMMALIA. 479exhibit more variety in their habits and modesof existence, than the one we are now examining.Each race has its peculiar destinationwith regard to the kind of food by which it isnourished, and the means by which that foodis obtained. The carnivorous tribes wage warwith the larger animals, whom they eitherspring upon unawares, or openly pursue andoverpower, displaying the savage energies oftheir nature, in practising all the arts of ferociousand sanguinary destruction. Others, intenton meaner prey, resort to divers stratagemsfor its possession ; some are designed to feedchiefly on the mollusca, and others swallow insectsonly. The numerous tribes which areformed to subsist on vegetable food exhibit, inlike manner, a great diversity of constructions,adapted to the particular nature of that subsistence,whether it be herbage, or the leaves oftrees, or fruits, or seeds, or the coarse fibresof the wood and bark. While all are giftedwith powers to obtain the nourishment theyrequire, those that have not been armed withweapons of attack, are still provided with instrumentsof defence, or with means of flight.Each has its respective sphere of operation ;and to each has its appropriate soil, habitation,climate, and element been assigned.It is easy to conceive that all these various cir-480 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.substances must lead to great diversities in theapparatus for mastication and for digestion,in the organization of the senses, in the constructionof the instruments of locomotion andof prehension, and in the general form of thebody to which these various parts are to beadapted. Yet, amidst all these variations, wemay perceive the same laws of analogy connectingthe whole into one series, and assimilating allthese multiform structures to one common standard.The same organ, however modified in itsshape and size, however stinted in one, or developedin another, is ever found in its appropriateplace, and retains the same connexions with adjacentorgans, whether we seek it in the carnivorousor the herbivorous quadruped, in the inhabitantof the land or of the water, in the denizenof the frigid or of the torrid zone ; or in animalsof the most diminutive or most colossal statures.As an example, we may take the vertebrae ofthe neck. It is a universal law, that this part ofthe spinal column shall, in every animal of theclass mammalia, consist of neither more nor lessthan seven vertebrae. Whatever be the lengthor shortness of the neck, whether it be compressedinto a small space, as in the elephantand the mole, whether it be lengthened to allowthe head to reach the ground, as in the horseand the ox, or whether it be excessively prolonged,to allow the animal to reach the tops ofMAMMALIA. 481trees, as in the came leopard, still this same constantnumber is preserved in the vertebrae whichit contains. When the neck is long, each individualvertebra must necessarily be lengthenedin the same proportion. Thus in the Cameleopard,the vertebra? of the neck consist of seven very longtubes, joined together endwise, with scarcelyany development of spinous processes, lest theyshould impede the bending of the neck. Thegreatest contrast to this structure is met with inthe Dolphin, and other Cetacea, which presentexternally no appearance whatever of a neck,but whose skeleton exhibits cervical vertebra?,closely compressed together, and exceedinglythin, and most of them united together ;* everybone, thus formed, however, retains the marksof having originally consisted of separate vertebrae; and still, in this extreme case, the numberof primary pieces is constantly seven, fIn the cachalot, the whole of these seven vertebrae areusually anchylosed into one bone.f The Bradypus tridactylus, or three toed sloth, was, till verylately, thought to constitute a notable exception to this law,being described as having nine, instead of seven, cervical vertebrae.It is now found, however, that the two last of thesevertebrae, which appeared to be supernumerary, ought properlyto be classed among the dorsal vertebrae, of which they possessthe distinctive characters, not only from the form and size oftheir transverse processes, but also from their having small bonyappendices, articulated with them by a regular joint at theirextremities, and corresponding exactly, both in shape and situation,to the ribs, of which they may, in fact, be considered asVOL. I. I I482 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.§ 2. Cetacea.Remarkable exemplifications of the law of uniformityof organic structure are furnished by thefamily of the Cetacea, which includes the whale,the cachalot, the dolphin, and the corpus, andexhibits the most elementary forms of the typeof the mammalia, of which they represent theearly, or rudimental stage of development.Here, as before, we have to seek these first elementsamong the inhabitants of the water : forwhenever, in our progress through the animalkingdom, we enter upon a new division, aquatictribes are always found to compose the lowestlinks of the ascending chain. Here, also, weobserve organic development proceeding withmore rapidity, and raising structures of greaterdimensions in aquatic than in terrestrial animals.The order Cetacea comprises by far the largestrudiments. These small bones have been observed, both byMeckel and by Cuvier, attached to the ninth vertebra: andMr. T. Bell has recently not only confirmed the observations ofthese anatomists, but has farther discovered, that similar rudimentalribs are attached also to the eighth vertebra. (See PhilosophicalMagazine, third series, iii. 376). The Bradypustorquatus which has been said to possess eight cervical vertebrae,will, perhaps, on closer examination, be hereafter found not todeviate, any more than the three-toed sloth, from the normaltype, as regards the number of these vertebrae. Instances haveoccurred of supernumerary cervical processes, or ribs in the humanskeleton. (See Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, xl. 304.)< ETACEA. 483animals which inhabit the globe. Whatevermay have been the magnitude of those hugemonsters which once moved in the bosom of theprimeval ocean, or stalked with gigantic stridesacross antediluvian plains, and whose scatteredremains bear fearful testimony of the convulsionsof a former world, certain it is that, at the presentday, the whales of the northern seas are themost colossal of the living animal structuresexisting on the surface of this planet.A cursory survey of the organization of thetribes belonging to this semi-amphibious family,will impress us with the resemblance they bearto fishes ; for they present the same oval outlineof the body, the same compact form of the trunk,which is united with the head without an interveningneck ; the same fin-like shape of the externalinstruments of motion, and the same enormousexpansion and prolongation of the tail,which is here also, as in fishes, the chief agent inprogression. With all this agreement in externalcharacters, their internal economy is conductedupon a totally different plan ; for althoughconstantly inhabiting the ocean, their vital organsare so constructed as to admit of theirbreathing only the air of the atmosphere, andthe consequences which flow from this differenceare of great importance. The necessity of aerialrespiration compels them to rise, at short intervals,to the surface of the water ; and this air,with which they fill their lungs in respiration,484 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.gives their bodies the buoyant force that isrequired to facilitate their ascent, and supersedesthe necessity of a swimming bladder, an organwhich is so useful to the fish.With the intent of diminishing still farthertheir specific gravity, nature has provided that alarge quantity of oily fluid shall be collectedunder the skin, a provision which answers alsothe purpose of preserving the vital warmth ofthe body. A great accumulation of this lightersubstance is formed on the upper part of thehead, apparently with a view to facilitate theelevation to the surface of the blowing hole, ororifice of the nostrils, which is placed there.*Another peculiarity of conformation, in whichthe cetacea differ from fishes, and which has alsoan obvious relation to their peculiar mode ofbreathing, is in the form of the tail, which, insteadof being compressed laterally, and inflected fromside to side, as in fishes, is flattened horizontally,and strikes the water in a vertical direction,thereby giving the body a powerful impulsion,either towards the surface, when the animal isconstrained to rise, or downwards, when, bydiving, it hastens to escape from danger.All the essential and permanent parts of theskeleton of vertebrated animals, that is, the spinalcolumn, and its immediate dependencies, theThe substance called Spermaceti is lodged in cells, formedof a cartilaginous substance, situated on the upper part of thehead of the Cachalot.CETACEA. 485skull, the caudal prolongation, and the ribs, arefound in that of the Cetacea. The thorax iscarried very much forwards, especially in thewhale, and the neck is so short as to be scarcelyrecognisable : for the object of the conformationis here, as in that of the fish, to allow free scopefor the movements of the tail, and ample space forthe lodgement of its muscles. For the purposeof giving greater power and more extensive attachmentto these muscles, the transverse processesof the dorsal and lumbar vertebrae are expandedboth in length and breadth, and beingsituated horizontally, offer no impediment to thevertical flexure of the spine. For the samereason the ribs are continued in a line with thetransverse processes, and articulated with theirextremities, thus giving still farther breadth tothe trunk.As there is a total absence of hinder extremities,so there is no enlargement of anyof the vertebrae corresponding to a sacrum, andthe caudal vertebrae are uninterrupted continuationsof those of the trunk. They developed,however, parts which are met with only amongfishes and reptiles, namely, arches composedof inferior leaves* and spinous processes, enclosingand giving protection to a large artery.Although the bones of the legs do not exist,These leaves being formed of cartilage, are generally lostwhen the bones are macerated for the purpose of preparing theskeleton.M(>THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.yet there are found, in the hinder and lower partof the trunk, concealed in the flesh, and quitedetached from the spine, two small bones, apparentlycorresponding to pelvic bones, for thepresence of which no more probable reason canbe assigned than the tendency to preserve ananalogy with the more developed structures ofthe same type.A similar adherence to the law of uniformityin the plan of construction of all the animals belongingto the same class, is strikingly shown inthe conformation of the bonesof the anterior extremities ofthe cetacea ; for although theypresent, externally, no resemblanceto the leg and foot ofa quadruped, being fashionedinto fin-like members, with aflat oval surface for strikingthe water, yet when the bonesare stripped of the thick integumentwhich covers themand conceals their real form,we find them (as may beseen in Fig. 216) exhibitingthe same divisions into carpaland metacarpal bones, andphalanges of fingers, as existin the most highly developed organization, notmerely of a quadruped, but also of a monkey,and even of man.AMPHIBIA. 487§ 3. Amphibia.In the small tribe denominated by CuvierAmphibia, and consisting of the Phoca, or Seal,and the Trichecus, or Walrus, we perceive thatan advance is made towards a fuller developmentof the limbs : these animals having adistinct neck and pelvis, and both hind andfore extremities. In the seal the hind legs aredrawn out posteriorly to a considerable length,and placed parallel to each other : when unitedand alternately raised and depressed, they performthe same office as the tail of the cetacea,and propel the animal forwards : but when employedseparately, they are more qualified to actas oars. The walrus has feet still more developed,and distinctly divided into toes, which aredisposed so as to strike backwards against thewater.§ 4. Mammiferous Quadrupeds in general.From the imperfectly developed aquatic andamphibious tribes we gradually ascend to themore finished structures of mammiferous quadrupeds,which are expressly fitted for progressionon land. In these the powers of dev elopement,488 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.not being expended in the mere effort of givingexpansion to the several textures, and of swellingthe bulk of the frame, sometimes to inordinatedimensions, are employed rather in reducingthe elements of the organization into compactforms, and in concentrating their energies, so asultimately to attain the extent of power andharmony of action, which are displayed in thehigher orders of warm-blooded quadrupeds.It is to these favoured tribes that we mustlook for examples of the most complete developmentof the skeleton, and the most advantageousdisposition of mechanic force. We have seenthat reptiles, from the comparative shortness oftheir limbs, and the torpidity of their muscularpowers, are but ill adapted for rapid progression.In all the more perfectly formed quadrupeds ofthe class mammalia, the trunk of the body, beingraised high upon the limbs, possesses great rangeof motion, and can traverse with fewer steps agiven space.The office of the limbs, as far as they are concernedin progressive motion, is two-fold. Theyhave, first, to sustain the weight of the body,which they must do by acting in opposition tothe force of gravity ; and they must, secondly,give the body an impulse forwards. Let us considermore particularly the relations which thestructures bear to each of these two functions.The limbs of quadrupeds constitute fourMAMMIFEROUS QUADRUPEDS. 489columns of support to the trunk, which is placedhorizontally above them ; but the whole weightof the body, together with that of the head andneck, does not bear equally upon them ; thefore extremities almost always sustain the greaterpart of that weight, both because the fore partof the trunk is itself heavier than the hind part,and because it is loaded with the additionalweight of the head and neck. Hence, in theusual attitude of standing, the pieces of whichthe fore limbs are composed are required to beplaced more in a straight line than those of thehinder limb : for the power of a column to supporta weight is the greater in proportion as itapproaches to the perpendicular position. Thehind limbs are composed of exactly the samenumber of divisions ; but the separate portionsare usually longer than those of the fore extremity,and consequently if they had been disposedvertically in a straight line, they wouldhave elevated the hinder part of the trunk to toogreat a height compared with the fore part.This is obviated by their forming alternateangles with one another. As the pelvis connectsthe spine with the joint of the hip, andeven extends farther backwards, the thigh bonemust necessarily be brought forwards ; then thetibia and fibula, which compose the bones of theleg must be carried backwards to their junctionwith the bones of the foot ; and again the foot490 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.must be turned forwards in its whole length fromthe heel to the extremities of the toes. On comparingthe positions of the corresponding divisionsof the anterior and posterior extremities, we observethat they incline, when bent, in oppositedirections ; for in the former we find, in followingthe series of bones from the spine, thatthe scapula proceeds forwards, the humerusbackwards ; the radius and ulna again forwards,and the fore foot backwards, positions which areexactly the reverse of the corresponding bonesof the hind limb. (See Fig. 218, page 507.)The weight of the body, in consequence ofthis alternate direction of the angles at the successivejoints, must always tend, while thequadruped is on its legs, to bend each limb : atendency which is required to be counteractedby the actions of the muscles which are situatedon the external side of each of those angles.These muscles are the extensors of the joints ;that is, the muscles which tend to bring theirparts into a straight line. It is, in fact, by thismuscular action, much more than by simplerigidity, that the limb supports the superincumbentweight of the body. It is evidentthat greater muscular force is necessary for thispurpose when the joints are bent, than whenthey are already extended ; and the portions ofthe fore legs being naturally in this condition,require less power than those of the hinder legsto retain them in their proper relative positions.MAMMIFEROUS QUADRUPEDS. 491The most complete instance of a verticalarrangement of the bones of the extremities isseen in the Elephant ; where in order to sustainthe enormous weight of the body, the limbs areshaped into four massive columns, of which theseveral bones are disposed nearly in perpendicularlines. By this means the body is supportedwith scarcely any muscular effort, andthe attitude of standing is, in this animal, a stateof such complete repose, that it often sleeps inthat position. The elephant which was keptsome years ago at the Menagerie at Paris,although much enfeebled by a lingering disorder,was never seen to lie down till the dayon which he died. When he was in the laststage of debility, what seemed to give him mostdistress was the effort requisite to support hishead : and in order to relieve the muscles of theneck which were strained in that exertion, hewas in the habit of extending his trunk perpendicularlyto the ground, by contracting allthe muscular fibres which run transversely inthat organ, and thus formed a vertical prop forthe head. But in almost all other quadrupedsthe mere act of standing, though a state ofcomparative rest, implies, for the reasons alreadygiven, a degree of muscular exertion, and theycan enjoy complete repose only by letting thebody recline upon the ground.The conformation of the hind extremities,which, as we have seen, is not so well calculated492 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS*.for the simple support of. the trunk, is, on theother hand, better adapted to give it those impulseswhich are to effect its progressive movements.The nature of those movements, and theorder in which they succeed each other, are differentaccording to the peculiar mode of progressionwhich the animal practises, the degreeof speed it is desirous of exerting, and the particularend it has in view. The paces of a quadrupedusually distinguished, are the walk, thetrot, the gallop, the amble, and the bound.In slow walking, only one foot is raised fromthe ground at the same moment, so that threepoints of support always exist for sustaining theweight of the body. If the centre of gravity besituated, as it generally is, nearly over the middleof the quadrangular base formed by the feet,while they rest upon the ground, the first effectto advance which the quadruped makes, propelsthe centre of gravity forwards. This it accomplishesby pressing one of its hind legs againstthe ground ; which leg being thus fixed by theresistance it there meets with, becomes the fulcrumof the first movements. The extensormuscles of the limb are now exerted in givingthe body an impulse forwards. As soon as thisimpulse has been given, the muscles which hadbeen in action are relaxed, and the leg is raisedfrom the ground, brought forwards, and laid downclose to the fore foot of the same side. This forePROGRESSIVE MOTION IN QUADRUPEDS. 493foot is next raised and advanced : and then thesame succession of actions takes place with thehind and the fore foot of the other side.An attentive examination of the conditions ofthese successive positions will show that, amidstall the changes which take place in the points ofsupport, the stability of the body is constantly preserved.It is an elementary proposition in mechanicsthat all that is necessary for ensuring thesupport of a body on any given base, is that thevertical line drawn from the centre of gravityshall fall within that base. When the animal isstanding, the feet form a quadrilateral base, andthe centre of gravity is in a vertical line passingeither through the centre of the base, or, as, forthe reasons already mentioned, more frequentlyhappens, through a point a little in front of theexact centre. At the time when the hind footwhich began the action is raised from the ground,the centre of gravity, having been, by that action,impelled forwards, still remains above the baseformed by the other three feet, and which is nowreduced to a triangle. That hind foot being setdown, while the corresponding fore foot is raised,a new triangular base is formed by the samehind foot, together with the two of the other side,which have not yet been raised. The centre ofgravity is still situated above this new triangle,and the body is consequently still supported onthese three feet. The fore foot may now be THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.danced without endangering the stability of thebody : and by the time this foot is set down, andhas thereby formed a new quadrilateral basiswith the other feet, the centre of gravity hasarrived above the centre of this new base. Butat this moment the centre of gravity is againurged forwards by the other hind foot, which nowcomes into action, and repeats on the other sidethe same succession of actions, which are attendedwith the same consequences as before.Thus, during its whole progress, the animal isnever for an instant in danger of falling ; forwhichever of the feet may be raised from theground, the other three feet are always so placedas to form a stable base of support.In quick walking it often happens that quadrupedsraise their fore foot on either side a littlebefore the hind foot comes to the ground. Thisis shown by the impression made by the latterbeing in the same spot, or even rather in advanceof the impression made by the former.But the time during which the body is thus supportedonly by two feet is so short as not sensiblyto influence the results.In consequence of the obliquity of the alternateimpulses given to the centre of gravity by thesuccessive actions of both the hind legs, a slightdegree of undulation is occasioned ; but theseundulations are only lateral. A trot may be consideredas a succession of short leaps made byPROGRESSIVE MOTION IN QUADRUPEDS. 495each set of feet taken diagonally ; that is, by theright fore foot, and the left hind foot ; or, viceversa,the one set being raised together a shorttime before the others have reached the ground :so that during that minute interval of time allthe feet are in the air at the same moment ; andduring the remaining portion of the time, thebody is resting upon the two feet placed diagonallywith regard to each other. The undulationsare here chiefly vertical, instead of lateral,as they are in the walking pace.A gallop is a continued succession of longerleaps made by the two hind feet in conjunction.In this case, the centre of gravity is lifted higherfrom the ground, and is projected in a wide arch,and with great velocity.In the amble, both the legs on one side areraised together ; so that the impulsions given aredirected much more laterally than in any otherpace, and the body is thrown into a strong undulatorymotion from side to side.Another kind of pace is the bound, which isoften practised by deer, and is performed bystriking the ground with all the legs at the samemoment. It consists, therefore, like the gallop,of a series of leaps ; but their direction is moreuniformly upwards, from the concurrence of allthe legs in the same action.Nature has purposely endowed different tribeswith very different capacities to execute THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.restive movements, by the variations she hasintroduced into the comparative lengths of theseveral parts of the trunk, and the size and mobilityof the extremities. Of all the large animals,the Lion has been constructed with thefinest proportions for conferring both strengthand activity. The mass of his body is supportedmore by the fore than by the hind extremities.In walking, the lion takes long strides, and exhibitsstrongly the lateral undulations of the trunk.Quadrupeds having a very long, or a verymassive body, or whose limbs are short, andnearly of equal height, are incapable of advancingby a gallop, or at least cannot sustainthis pace without a painful effort, and never butfor a short time. The Tiger, which has a longerbody than the lion, gallops with less facility ;and runs chiefly by an acceleration of its walkingpace. It excels principally in the vigourand extent of its bounds ; for which it is admirablyqualified by prodigious power of its muscles,enabling it to spring forwards upon its victimwith an impetus which nothing can resist.The speed with which a quadruped is capableof advancing depends more on the disposition ofthe muscles and the extent of the articulations,and more especially on the power of the extensorsof the hind extremities, than on the formof the body. Great length and muscularity inthe hind legs are generally attended with con-progressiveMOTION IN QUADRUPEDS. 497miserable power of leaping. This is exemplifiedin the Jerboa and the Kanguroo, animals, which,from the disproportionate shortness of theirfore legs, are totally incapacitated from walking; and for the same reason, they cannot runwith any degree of swiftness. It is only inclimbing up a steep acclivity that the jerboa isenabled to employ all its limbs: in a descent,on the contrary, it uses only its fore legs, thehinder being dragged after them. But, whenpursued, these animals are capable, for a longcontinuance, of taking leaps of nine feet distance,and of repeating these leaps so quickly,that the Cossacks, though mounted on theswiftest horses, are unable to overtake them.The Kanguroo, in almost all his movements,brings into action his powerful tail, which is furnishedwith very strong muscles, and may beconsidered as constituting a fifth limb. It is ofgreat assistance to the animal in taking leaps,and during its repose, contributes, together withthe hind feet, to support the weight of the body,as on a tripod, and to leave at liberty the forelegs,which may then be employed as arms.The Hare and the Rabbit furnish other instancesof an extraordinary length of the hinderlegs depriving the animal of the power of walking,and obliging it to move forwards only bya succession of leaps. The hare may be said,indeed, to walk with its fore legs only, while itvol. I. K K498 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.gallops with the hinder : but this disadvantageis amply compensated by its amazing swiftnesswhen running at full speed.Animals like the hare, in which, from thegreat length of the hinder limbs, the posteriorhalf of the body is higher than the anterior, runmuch better up a declivity than on level ground.In a descent, on the contrary, they are obligedto pursue an oblique and zig-zag course, otherwisethey would be in danger of oversetting, ashappens occasionally to the Agouti and theGuinea pig, when these animals attempt to rundown hill.The Sloth, which is formed for clinging withgreat tenacity to the boughs of trees, presents aremarkable contrast to the animals we have justnoticed ; its fore legs being much longer than thehinder, and its movements being proverbiallyslow. The peculiar modifications of its muscularpowers are probably consequences of thesingular mode in which, as I shall afterwardshave occasion to notice, its arteries are distributed.The Cameleopard, likewise, has the fore legsmuch longer than the hinder. The object ofthis conformation was probably to elevate theanterior part of the spine, so as to raise the headas much as possible, and also to give a considerableinclination to the whole column, for thepurpose of distributing more equally the weightPROGRESSIVE MOTION IN QUADRUPEDS. 499of the head and of the very long neck uponall the legs ; for the length of the neck is fullyequal to that of the trunk. It is evident that ifthe body had been placed in the usual horizontalposition, the anterior extremities would havehad to support the whole of the enormous weightof this neck and head. This peculiarity ofstructure, however, introduces considerable modificationsin the mode of progression of theanimal. The ordinary pace of the camel leopardis the amble ; but it has also a slowerwalking pace, and occasionally a gallop. Inthe amble, its undulation is so considerable as togive it the appearance of being lame. A similarkind of limping gait, arising from the samecause, namely, the disproportionate elevation ofthe fore part of the spine, has been observed inthe Hyaena.§ 5. Ruminantiaia.In following the series of Mammalia in the orderwhich best exhibits their successive stages of development,I shall commence with those whosedigestive apparatus is formed to extract nourishmentexclusively from the vegetable kingdom.The first assemblage that presents itself to ournotice is the remarkable family of Ruminants,500 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.which feed principally on herbage. Whereverthe earth is cloathed with vegetation, it requiresneither skill nor exertion on their part to seekand to devour the rich repast which is profuselyspread under their feet. To remove from onepasture to another, to browse, and to repose, constitutethe peaceful employments of their lives,and satisfy the chief conditions of their existence.To these purposes the whole conformation of theirskeleton, and especially of those parts which constitutethe limbs, is adapted. The anterior extremitieshaving only to support the weight ofthe fore part of the trunk, and to assist in progressivemotion, have a less complicated arrangementof joints, and exhibit many of those consolidationsof the bones, which tend to simplify thestructure, and to contribute to its strength.But though never incited by the calls of appetiteto engage in sanguinary warfare, they areyet liable to the assaults of many ferocious andwell armed adversaries, and often unprovidedwith any adequate means of defence ; their onlyresource, therefore, is to avoid the dangers ofthe encounter by a rapid and precipitate flight.To confer this power appears to have been theobject aimed at by nature in every part of theconformation of these animals. It is among theruminant tribes that the fleetest of quadrupedsare to be found, such as the gazelle, the antelope,and the deer, animals which exhibit theRUMINANT QUADRUPEDS. 501highest perfection of structure belonging to thistype. We may observe that the parts composingthe hind legs are longer, and inclined toone another at angles more acute in these animalsthan in other tribes of mammalia, so thatthey are always ready for instantly commencingtheir flight, and springing forwards on the slightestnotice of danger. (See Fig. 218, page 507).As it was necessary, from the situation of theirfood, that their heads should reach the groundin grazing, we find that the neck has been muchelongated, that the muscles which raise the headhave been enlarged and strengthened, and thatthe spinous processes of the back and neck havebeen much expanded in order to allow of sufficientsurface for the attachments of these muscles.The effort requisite to raise, and even support thehead is very considerable ; as will appear whenwe reflect that its weight acts by means of anextremely long lever ; for such is the mechanicaloffice of the elongated neck. But in order toeconomize the muscular power, an elastic ligamentis employed to sustain the weight of thehead. This, which is termed the ligamentumnucha, and is represented at n, in Fig. 217, isformed of a great number of bands which connectthe hinder part of the cranium, at the ridge ofthe occipital bone, and all the spinous processesof the neck, with those of the back, the separateslips from each being successively joined THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.ther, and composing a ligament of great lengthand power. It differs in its structure fromordinary ligaments, being highly elastic, so thatit yields to the extension of the neck whenthe animal lowers its head, and gives considerableassistance to the muscles in raising it. Inthe deer and the ox, which toss their headswith force, and especially in the males, whichare armed with antlers or horns, the musclesperforming those motions are remarkably strong,and the spinous processes of the back particularlyprominent. In the loins, on the contrary,we find the transverse processes more enlarged,for the purpose of giving a powerful mechanicalpurchase to the muscles which are inserted intothem.The chest of ruminant quadrupeds is compressedlaterally in order to allow room for theRUMINANT QUADRUPEDS. 503unrestrained motions of the anterior extremity;and the sternum projects so as to resemble thekeel of a ship. The bones of the anterior extremityare not joined to the rest of the skeleton bymeans of any bone corresponding to a clavicle ;but they are connected with the spine and ribsonly by ligaments and muscles ; so that the forepartof the trunk is in fact suspended betweenthe limbs by its muscular attachments alone.This is not the case with the hind extremities ;for their bones commence with the pelvis, whichproceeds backwards from the sacrum, but witha considerable inclination downwards, and hasadeep hemispherical cavity for the lodgment ofthe round head of the thigh bone. The lengthenedforms of the iliac bones, and also of thescapula, provide for the application of musclesof considerable length, which are consequentlycapable of communicating to the parts they movea greater velocity than could have been effectedby muscles of equal strength, but with shorterfibres.Both the humerus in front, and the femurbehind, are so short as to appear, on a superficialview, to form part of the trunk, beingentirely enveloped and concealed by the largemuscles connecting them with the body. Theheads of the two humeri, in consequence of theabsence of the clavicle, are brought very near504 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.each other, so as to occupy a situation as nearlyas possible underneath the weight which thelimb has to support.The radius and ulna, which are the two bonesof the fore arm, although completely separate atan early period of growth, soon unite to formbut one bone. This union begins at their lowerend, and proceeds upwards to within a short distancefrom the top, where a separation may stillbe observed in the processes which project fromthat end, forming for some way down a distinctsuture. This union of the two bones must, ofcourse, preclude all rotatory motion ; but it iscalculated to give the joint great security :and this appears to have been the main objectin the conformation of the whole limb. Thesame process of consolidation takes place in thehind leg, between the tibia and the fibula, whichare so completely united, as to afford scarcelyany trace of their having been originally separate.The carpus and the tarsus are both of verylimited extent, and consist of a smaller numberof pieces than usually occur in these joints.The consolidation of parts is most conspicuousin the succeeding division of the limb, namely,that constituting the metacarpus in the anterior,and the metatarsus in the hind extremity. Ineither case we find it consisting, not of fivebones, as in the more highly organized canisQUADRUPEDS. 505porous mammalia, but of a single bone only,termed the cannot bone. In the early periods ofossification, however, they each consisted of twoslender bones, lying close and parallel to eachother ; but afterwards united by an ossific deposition,which fills up the interval between them,and leaves behind no trace of suture.* In proportionas the young animal acquires strength,the union of these two bones becomes still moreintimate by the absorption of the partition whichseparated their cavities ; so that ultimately theyconstitute but one cylinder, with a single centralcavity, which is occupied by marrow.The cannon bone is much elongated, both inthe fore and hind extremity ; so that the carpusand tarsus, which are the commencements of thereal feet, are raised considerably above theground. It is a common mistake, arising fromthe height of these joints, and the names theybear in ordinary language, to consider them asthe knees of the animal. The slightest inspect: on of the skeleton will be sufficient to showthat what is called the knee in the fore leg isproperly the wrist ; and in the hind leg, the partso misnamed is really the heel. Thus the foot,especially in the posterior extremity, is of greatlength ; a structure which is evidently intendedThe observations which establish this fact are detailed by G.St. Hilaire, in a paper in the " Memoires du Museum," x. 173.50(3 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.to give greater velocity to the actions of themuscles, while it at the same time ensures theutmost steadiness and security of motion.At the lower extremity of the cannon bonethere are two articular surfaces, indicating theoriginally separate ends of its two componentbones. They are for the articulation of the twofollowing bones, which are also very long, andwhich correspond in situation to the first phalangesof the fingers and toes. These are followedby a second and third set of phalanges ;the last of which terminate in hoofs. All ruminantquadrupeds have thus a double hoof; acharacter which is peculiar to this family.Thus, then, has Nature moulded the organs ofprogressive motion in this remarkable tribe ofanimals to accommodate them to the peculiarconditions of their existence, while she has stillpreserved their relations to the primitive type ofthe class to which they belong. Thus has shebestowed upon them the slender and elegantforms, so pleasing to the eye, which characterisethe fleetest racer, and has provided for the agile,yet firm and secure movements which they areto exercise in various ways in eluding the observation,and escaping from the pursuit of theirstronger and more sagacious foes. This purposethey effect, at one time by rapid flight acrossextensive tracts of country ; at another, by retirementinto unfrequented forests, or mountainsRUMINANT QUADRUPEDS.of difficult access, crossing their rugged surfacesin all directions, clambering their precipitous508 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.acclivities, and fearlessly bounding over interveningabysses, from point to point, till theplace of safety is attained on some rocky eminence.From this secure station the Alpinechamois looks down upon its pursuers, and defiestheir further efforts at capture or molestation.The astonishing feats of agility practisedby this animal, and by which the most experiencedhunters are perpetually baffled in theirattempts to approach it, sufficiently attest theperfection of its organization in reference to allthese objects. The chamois has often been seento leap down a perpendicular precipice of twentyor thirty feet in height, without sustaining theslightest injury. How the ligaments that bindthe joints can resist the violent strains and concussionsthey must be exposed to in these quickand jarring efforts, is truly wonderful.While Nature has provided these animalswith the means of safety from their more formidableenemies, she has not left them altogetherwithout defence against their more equalrivals in the field. It is on the head that shehas implanted those powerful arms which aresometimes wielded with deadly effect in theirmutual combats. Even when not furnishedwith horns, the animal instinctively strikes withits forehead, where the frontal bone has beenexpanded and fortified, apparently with a viewto this mode of attack. Thus, the ram butts withRUMINANT QUADRUPEDS. 509its head without reference to the horns, whichare coiled so as to be turned away from theobject to be struck. In the deer and the oxtribes, however, the horns are formidable weaponsof offence : and it will be interesting toinquire into the nature of these organs, and thephenomena of their production.The antlers of the male stag are osseous structures,supported on short and solid tubercles ofthe frontal bone : after remaining nearly a yearthey are cast off, and soon replaced by a newlyformed antler, which is of larger size than theone which was lost. Previously to the formationof this structure, those branches of theartery, termed the carotid, which supply bloodto the frontal bone, are observed very rapidly todilate, and to throb with unusual force ; and allthe blood-vessels of the skin of the part wherethe antler is to arise, soon become distendedwith blood, an effect which is accompanied bygeneral heat and redness, like a part in a stateof high inflammation.* Presently the skin iselevated by the growth of a tubercle from thesubjacent bone : this tubercle is at first a cartilage,and after it has attained a certain size,becomes ossified, and grows like other osseousstructures, first shooting into the form of a lengthenedcylinder, and then dividing into branches.These phenomena are connected with periodical changes inthe constitution relating to the reproductive functions.510 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.It is followed in its elongation by the skin, whichduring the whole time that the antler is growingis extended over it in every part, forming whatis called, from the delicate investment of hair,its velvet coat. The blood-vessels of the propermembrane of the antler, or periosteum, still continuingto supply it with the materials requiredfor its growth and consolidation, deposit so greatan abundance of bony matter, that its enlargementis exceedingly rapid. The whole antler*which often weighs nearly thirty pounds, hasbeen known to be completely formed in tenweeks from the time of its first appearance.There is no other instance in the animal kingdomof so rapid a growth ; which is the moreremarkable from its occurring in a small partof the system, and in a bony structure.After the antler has attained its full size, adeposition of osseous substance still continues atits base, around the trunks of the arteries whichare proceeding along the investing membrane ofthe bone for the purpose of conveying nourishment.The accumulation of this substance raisesa ring, called the burr, round that part of theantler: and by encroaching on the arteriesthemselves, it gradually diminishes their capacityof conveying blood, and they at length becomeentirely obliterated. The bone, no longerreceiving a superabundant nourishment, ceases togrow ; the integuments which covered it, decay,and becoming dry and shrivelled, are torn byRUMINANT QUADRUPEDS. 51 1rubbing against trees, and peel off in longshreds, leaving the antler exposed, which, bythe continued effects of the same kind of friction,soon acquires a polished surface.During many months the antler being sufficientlynourished by its own interior vessels,continues in a living state, and preserves itsconnexion with the system. But at length thearteries, whether from the effect of the progressivedeposition of osseous matter, or from somechange in the balance of the vital powers, shrinkand become by degrees obliterated. The antlerdies in consequence, and although it continuesto adhere to the skull, it is only as a foreignbody, and it is not long destined to remain thusattached ; for the absorbent vessels are now activelyemployed in scooping out a groove of separationbetween the living and the decayedsubstance, at the place where the base of theantler is contiguous to the frontal bone. Assoon as this has proceeded to a sufficient depth,the adhesion ceases, and the slightest concussionoccasions the fall of the whole structure. Afterthe separation of the antler, the eminence of thefrontal bone on which it stood is left rough anduneven like that of a fractured part: but thesurrounding integuments soon close over, andcover it completely ; until the period arriveswhen it is to be replaced by a new antler, whichexhibits the same succession of phenomena inits growth and decay as its predecessor, only that512 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.its development is usually carried farther, thenew stem being both thicker and longer, andthe branches wider and more numerous. Theantler of each successive year has, consequently,a different form from that of the preceding ; andwhen the animal has attained a certain age, theextremities of the branches present broad expansionsof bone, which the antlers of an earliergrowth had never exhibited.The short bony processes which extend in aperpendicular direction on the head of thecame leopard, are analogous, in some of the circumstancesof their formation, to the antlers ofthe deer, being of an osseous nature, and continuouswith the frontal bone : but in otherrespects they are very different; for instead ofbeing annually shed, they remain through life,and continue to be covered with the integuments,which retain, at the extremities, a tuft ofhair. The development of these processes inthe young animal takes place in the same manneras that of an antler, but it reaches only to acertain point, upon attaining which the growthis arrested, and never proceeds farther. Thearteries cease to deposit superabundant nourishment,but continue to maintain an exact equilibriumbetween the expenditure and the supply ;so that the horns of the came leopard are nevershed, and remain permanent bony structures.A further modification of this process occursRUMINANT QUADRUPEDS. 513in the construction of the horns of the ox andof the sheep : for in these the bony processesarising from the frontal bones are invested witha covering composed of horn, the nature ofwhich is totally different from bone. Two tuberclesmay be seen in the young calf, proceedingfrom the bones of the forehead : the skincovering these tubercles, unlike that which precedesthe antlers of the deer, is unusually thickand hard. As the skull expands, this portionof integument becomes more and more callous,till it is converted, by the action of the subjacentvessels, into a solid, hard, elastic, and insensiblefibrous substance, fitted to give effectual protectionto the subjacent bony layers which areforming underneath it. The highly vascularmembrane, from which these new structureschiefly arise, appears to have different powers ofproduction at its two surfaces : for while the innersurface is forming the osseous portion of the horn,and supplying the phosphate of lime required forthe construction of its plates and fibres, the exteriorsurface is adding successive layers of hornysubstance to the inner side of those portions whichhad been before deposited. These two operations,which offer a remarkable contrast, both asto the mode of their performance, and as to thenature of the resulting products, are carried onat the same time, and by the same organ, buton different sides. The bony basis of the hornVOL. I. L L514 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.is an organic structure, which continues to benourished by vessels forming part of the generalsystem : the horn is a mere excretion, whichappears to be destitute of vessels, and is, consequently,removed from the influence of theliving powers. Thus the growth of horn issomewhat analogous to that of shell ; for thelayers which compose it are deposited in succession; each new layer is agglutinated to theinner surface of the preceding ; and each hasthe shape of a hollow cone, occupying the parttowards the apex of the former cone, and extendingfarther towards the base. Hence alongitudinal section of the whole presents theappearance represented in the annexed figures(218*), where a is the section of the horn of anOx, and b, a similar section of the horn of anAntelope. C is a magnified view of the extremityof the latter, together with a portion of thebone d, which occupies the axis of the horn.In this process of the formation of horn, ashappens in that of shells, there sometimes occurirregularities, or periodical intermissions andincrease of action in the secreting organs, givingrise to transverse grooves, or ridges. Thesemay be seen in the horns of the goat, in whichthe fibres are short, and laid one over anotherwith the same regularity as the tiles of a house.The tendency in these horns to assume a spiralform is explicable on the same principles asRUMINANT QUADRUPEDSthose which regulate the growth of turbinatedshells. The horns of the ox and of the antelopetribes are formed of longer and morecontinuous fibres, which are closely compactedtogether, and exhibit very distinctly the seriesof hollow cones of which they are composed.The horns of the Rhinoceros, both of the oneand two horned species, grow from the integumentcovering the nose, to which they adherewithout having any connexion with the subjacentbones. They have a pyramidal shape,and are composed of parallel fibres, resembling516 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.hairs, agglutinated together into a solid massby a material which acts as a cement. Thisfibrous structure is most distinctly seen at thebase of the horn, where the ends of the fibresproject, like those of a brush, from the surface.When these horns are sawn transversely, and examinedwith a magnifying glass, a great numberof orifices are seen, marking the empty spacesthat intervene between the hairs ; and if the sectionbe made in a longitudinal direction, the samespaces give rise to the appearance of parallelgrooves. These horns are not deciduous, likethose of the stag : but continue to adhere to theskin, and to grow from the root, in proportion asthey are worn at the extremity.§ 6. Solipeda.The Solipeda form a natural family of quadrupeds,including the Horse, the Ass, the Quagga,the Zebra, &c. which are very nearly alliedin their conformation to the ruminant tribe. Tocombine fleetness with strength has been the obviousdesign of nature in the construction ofthese animals. We find, accordingly, that theconsolidation of the bones of the foot is carriedstill further than in the ruminant tribe ; for inplace of the two parallel phalanges, which arein the latter articulated with the cannon boneMAMMALIA SOLIPEDA. 517there is here only a single metatarsal bone. Thethree phalanges, of which that single finger consists,bear the names of the pastern, the coronet,and the coffin bone ; and the hoof, of course, issingle likewise ; there is also a small bone, connectedwith the last, and called the shuttle bone.To the cannon bone are joined, behind, and onthe side, two much shorter and very slenderbones, which are rudiments of the other metacarpalbones. They have been termed the styloid,or splint bones ; and are generally united by ossificationwith the cannon bone. The scapula ofthe horse is very narrow, and placed very nearlyin a straight line with the humerus ; which latterbone is very short, and scarcely descends belowthe line of the chest. The thigh-bone is also unusuallyshort. The muscles, which extend thejoint, and throw the thigh backwards in kicking,are particularly powerful. This is the naturaldefensive action of the horse : and its force is increasedby a particular process with which thebone is furnished, and which has the form of astrong curved spine, situated on the outside, andopposite to the lesser trochanter,* giving to themuscles the advantage of a long lever. The cervicalvertebrae have only short spinous processesthat they might not interfere with the motions ofThis process has been termed the processus recurvatus fervors.518 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.the neck. In the vertebrae of the back, on theother hand, these processes are remarkably long,especially at the part where the shoulder rests ;their projection constituting what is called theWithers,§ 7. Pachydermata.From the horse we pass by a natural transitionto the Pachydermata, a small group of animalsinteresting by their peculiarities, and by theirbeing remnants of a very extensive tribe, whichformerly inhabited the earth, but have now almostentirely disappeared. Although they feed upongrass, they do not ruminate, nor are they cloven-footed.They are for the most part huge andunwieldy animals, with thick integuments, renderedtough by a large mass of condensed cellularsubstance, which forms the chief defensivearmour of those that are destitute of either tusk,proboscis, or nasal horn.Tl>e most remarkable genus of this family isthe Elephant, the colossal giant of quadrupeds.The many peculiarities that are observable inthe conformation of this animal have all anobvious relation to the circumstances of its condition.Formed for feeding on a great variety ofvegetable substances, and more especially onthe tender shoots of trees, fruits, and grains, asMAMMALIA PACHYDERMATA. 519well as on herbage, and succulent roots, itsorgans of mastication are powerful, and itsteeth of great size. The whole of this apparatusrequires an immense development of bone torender it efficient; so that the head, with itshuge tusks and grinders, is of enormous weight.Had this ponderous head been suspended at theend of a neck of such length as to admit of itsbeing carried to the ground, as is the case ingrazing animals, it would have destroyed thebalance of the body, and would have requiredgreater force to raise and retain it in a horizontalposition than was competent to anydegree of muscular power. Nature has accordinglyabandoned this form of structure, andhas at once curtailed the neck, bringing thehead close to the trunk of the body, and supportingit by means of short, but powerfulmuscles, which are not implanted in any particularpoint of the skull, as they are in otherquadrupeds, where the occipital bone formsa crest or ridge for that purpose; but thegeneral surface of the cranium has been enlargedby an immense expansion given to itsinterior cellular structure, and thus the musclesare attached to a considerable extent of bone,instead of being affixed to a single process,which would have incurred great risk of beingbroken off by their action. These large cellsare constructed with a view to combine strength520 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.with lightness ; the plates which form their sidesbeing disposed in a radiated manner towards thecircumference, and arranged with great regularity; and the cells themselves, instead of containingmarrow, are filled with air, by means ofcommunications with the Eustachian tubes,which open into the nostrils : thus a greatextent of surface is given to the skull, withoutany addition to its weight. The ligamentumnuchae also comes in aid of the muscular power,being here of vast size and strength.The head being limited in its range of motionby its approximation to the trunk, the mouthcannot be applied directly to seize the food : andsome means were therefore to be provided forbringing the food to the mouth. For this purposea new organ, the proboscis, has been constructed: it consists of a cylinder, perfectlyflexible, and of a length sufficient to reach theground, when the elephant is standing. Theanimal has the power of moving it in all possibledirections by means of a prodigious number ofmuscular fibres, which are collected in smallbands, some passing transversely, and radiatingfrom the interior towards the circumference,others situated more obliquely, and a third setrunning longitudinally, and forming an exteriorlayer : but they are all variously interlacedtogether so as to compose a very complicatedarrangement. The extremity of the proboscis,MAMMALIA PACHYDERMATA. 521which is endowed with great sensibility, is furnishedwith an appendix, resembling a finger,most of the functions of which, indeed, it iscapable of performing.For the formation of this admirable memberit has not been necessary to deviate from theordinary laws of development by the creationof a new organ ; the same end being accomplishedby the extension of a structure alreadybelonging to the type of mammiferous animals.In several of the pachydermata the nostrils arealready considerably advanced, so as to form amoveable snout : this is observable in a certaindegree in the Hog ; it is still more remarkablyseen in the Tapir, which has a snout so lengthenedand so moveable as very much to resemble,though on a far smaller scale, the proboscisof the elephant. This latter organ, then, maybeconsidered as merely an elongation of thenostrils, which have been drawn out to suit aspecial purpose, very different from the functionto which that part is usually subservient.*While fleetness and elasticity are the resultsof the mechanical conformation of the horse,solidity and strength are the objects chieflyA defective development of the bones of the nasal cavity,while the natural growth of the soft parts has continued, hasoften, in the case of the human foetus, given rise to a monstrosityvery much resembling the trunk of the tapir or of the elephant.(See Geoffrey St. Hilaire.)522 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.aimed at in the construction of the pachydermata.The limbs have a great weight to sustain, inconsequenceof the huge size of the body ; andhence the several bones which compose thepillars for its support are arranged nearly invertical lines. The joints of the elbow and kneeare placed low from the body; the ulna in theforelegs, and the fibula in the hinder, are fullydeveloped, and are distinct from the radius andthe tibia. The number of the toes, instead ofbeing reduced to one, as in the horse, or to two,as in ruminants, is here increased to five : though,in consequence of their being very short, andof the skin which covers and surrounds thembeing very thick, they hardly appear externally,and are distinctly recognised only in theskeleton.It would carry me far beyond the limits of thepresent work, were I to engage in a detailedexamination of all the varieties of forms andstructures that occur in the mechanism of thedifferent tribes of mammalia, in reference to thepurposes they are intended to serve, and to thepeculiar circumstances of the animal to whichthey belong. I must necessarily pass over amultitude of instances of express adaptation,which are suited only to particular cases, andare, consequently, of minor importance as regardsthe general plans of organization. In the sortof bird's-eye view which I am taking of the endeMAMMALIA RODENTIA. 523less modifications of structure that have beenexecuted in conformity with those plans, I amable particularly to notice only such as are mostremarkable.§ 8. Rodentia.As the tribes of mammalia we have hithertoexamined employ the anterior extremities forthe purposes of progression only, they are destituteof a clavicle. In most of those which follow,and where a greater development of the limbconfers more extensive and more varied powersof motion, applicable to a greater range of objects,this bone is found. In the greater number,however, it is merely in a rudimental state ; thatis, developed only to a certain extent, one portionbeing bony, and the rest cartilaginous ; as if theossification had been arrested at an early stage.These imperfect clavicles are too short to connectthe scapula with the sternum ; the rest of thespace being eked out by cartilage, and by ligaments: but still they are of great use in affordingpoints of attachment to the muscles of the limb,and giving them the advantage of acting by arigid lever. The carnivorous tribes, which makeconsiderable use of their fore paws in strikingand seizing their prey, have clavicles of thisdescription. Those quadrupeds which have to524 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.execute still more complex actions with theirfore feet, have perfect clavicles, extending fromthe shoulder to the chest, and connecting thebones of the anterior extremity with the generalframe work of the skeleton. This is the caseina large proportion of the family of Rodent ia,such as the Squirrel, which employs its pawsfor holding objects ; and the Beaver* whichlikewise makes great use of its feet for movingand arranging the materials of its habitation.Animals that dwell in trees, and require to graspwith force the branches in moving along them,such as the Sloth, have also distinct clavicles.Animals which rake or dig the ground, as theMole, the Ant-eater, and the Hedge-hog are allprovided with these bones, which, by keepingthe shoulders at the same constant distance fromthe trunk, and affording a firm axis for the rotatorymotions of the limb, materially assist themin the performance of these actions.The beaver presents a singular modification in the structureof the tail, which is expanded into a flattened oval disk, coveredby a skin beset with scales : the whole forming a mechanicalinstrument, which may be compared to a trowel, exceedinglywell adapted for the purposes to which it is applied by the animalin constructing its mud habitation.- ' TIVOBOUg MAMMALIA. 525§ 9. jBmh tiara.In the tribe of Insectivorous quadrupeds we meetwith several races which present singular conformations.In none are these anomalies more remarkablethan in the mole, an animal whichnature has formed for subterranean residence,and whose limbs are contented with a view tothe rapid excavation of passages under ground.The hands of the mole, for its fore paws aim'deserve that appellation, are turned upwards andbackwards for scooping the soil, while the feetare employed to throw it out with great quickness.These mining operations are aided by themotions of the head, which is lifted with greatpower, so as to loosen the ground above, andovercome the resistances that may be opposed tothe progress of the animal. That no impedimentmight be offered to these motions of the head,the spinous processes of the cervical vertebraehave not been suffered to extend upwards.Large muscles are provided for bending the headbackwards upon the neck ; and they are assistedby a cervical ligament of great strength,which is generally in part ossified. Themuscles of the fore extremities are also of extraordinarypower. The scapula is a long andslender bone, more resembling a humerus in its526 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.shape than an ordinary scapula : the humerus,on the contrary, is thick and square, and the clavicleis short and broad. The radius and theulna are distinct from each other ; the hand isvery large and expanded; the palms beingturned outwards and backwards, and its lowermargin being fashioned into a sharp cuttingedge. The carpal bones and the phalanges ofthe fingers are very much compressed ; but theyare furnished with large nails, which composemore than half the hands; and they are expresslyconstructed for digging, being long,broad, and sharp at the extremities. The sternumhas a large middle crest, and is prolongedat its extremity into a sharp process, having thefigure of a ploughshare, thus affording an extensivesurface of attachment for the large pectoralmuscles, from which the limb derives its principalforce. The head terminates in front by apointed nose, which is armed at its extremitywith a small bone, intended to assist in penetratingthrough the ground.While all this attention has been paid to thedevelopment of the anterior part of the bodyto which these instruments specially contrivedfor burrowing are affixed, the hinder part is comparativelyfeeble, and appears stinted in itsgrowth, and curtailed of its fair proportions.The pelvis is exceedingly diminutive, being reducedto a slender sacrum ; and it is thrown farINSECTIVOROUS MAMMALIA. 527back from the abdomen, to which it could giveno effectual protection. Hence the animal,when above ground, walks very awkwardly, andis unable to advance but by an irregular andvacillating pace.*We have seen that there is a tribe of fishesarmed externally with sharp spines, which theyare capable of erecting when in danger of attack.A similar kind of defensive armour is furnishedto the Porcupine and the Hedgehog, which belongto the family of insectivorous quadrupeds.For the purpose of erecting these bristles, whenthe animal is irritated or alarmed, there is provideda peculiar set of muscular bands, whichforms part of the usual subcutaneous layer,termed the panniculus famous* In the hedgehogthese muscles are very complicated, andgive the animal the power of rolling itself intoa ball. A minute description of these muscleshas been given by Cuvier, who found that thewhole body is enveloped in a large muscularbag, or mantle, lying immediately under the integuments;and capable, by the contraction ofdifferent portions of its fibres, of carrying theThe only quadrupeds which resemble the mole in the perfectadaptation of their structure to the purposes of burrowing, arethe Wombat and the Koala, which are among the many extraordinaryanimals inhabiting the continent of Australia. Theirhind legs are constructed in a manner very much resembling thehuman fore-arm. (See Home, Lectures, &c. i. 134.)528 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.skin over a great extent of surface. In the usualstate of the animal, this broad muscle appears onthe back (as represented in Fig. 219), contractedinto a thick oval disk, of which the fibres aremuch accumulated at the circumference. Fromthe edges of this disk there pass down auxiliarymuscles towards the lower parts of the body ; theaction of which muscles tends to draw the skindownwards, and to coil it over the head and paws,in the manner shown in Fig. 220, like the closingof the mouth of a great bag.§10. Carnivora.The type of the Mammalia may be consideredas having attained its full development in thecarnivorous tribes, which comprehend the largerbeasts of prey. As their food is animal, theyrequire a less complicated apparatus for digestionthan herbivorous quadrupeds, possess greateractivity and strength, and enjoy a greater rangeof sensitive and intellectual faculties. In accordancewith these conditions we may noticeCARNIVOROUS MAMMALIA. 529the greater expansion of their brain, the superioracuteness of their senses, and their enormousmuscular power. The trunk of the bodyis lighter than that of vegetable feeders, especiallyin the abdominal region, and is compressedlaterally : the spine is more pliant and elastic,*the limbs have greater freedom of motion, theextremities are more subdivided, and they arearmed with formidable weapons of offence anddestruction. Great mechanical power was requiredfor raising the head, not only on accountof the force to be exerted in tearing flesh, butalso that these animals might be enabled tocarry away their prey in their mouths. Hencewe find that in the Lion, of which the skeletonis represented in its relations to the outline ofthe body, in Fig. 221, the first vertebra of theneck, or atlas, has very widely expanded transverseprocesses, while the second vertebra has alargely developed spinous process, for supplyinglevers for the muscles which have to performthese and other actions in which the head isconcerned.The whole of the remaining part of the skeletonof these animals is constructed with referenceto their predatory nature. The suddenThe suppleness of the spine might at once be inferred, onthe simple inspection of the skeleton, from the circumstance thatthe vertebrae of the neck and loins have a comparatively smalldevelopment of their spinous processes.VOL. I. MM530 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.springs with which they pounce upon theirprey must impart to the whole osseous frame themost violent concussion. The first stroke withwhich they attempt the destruction of theirvictims is given with the fore leg : so that hadthe limb been rigidly connected with the sternumby means of an entire clavicle, its motions wouldhave been too limited, and danger of fracturewould have been incurred. The scapula isbroad, and the humerus of great length, comparedwith the same bones in ruminants ; andthe latter has besides a large surface for itsarticulation with the former of these bones,thus allowing of a great range of motion : theradius and ulna are perfectly distinct, and playextensively on each other.The fore feet rest on the ground by means ofthe second of the three joints of which each toeCARNIVOROUS MAMMALIA. 531is composed. The last phalanges are raised atright angles to the former, for the purpose ofsupporting the claws in an erect position. Ithas been considered of such importance to preservethese formidable instruments constantlysharp, and in a condition fitted for immediateuse, that an express contrivance has been resortedto for this purpose. It consists in asheath, within which the claws, when not employed,are kept retracted, by means of anelastic ligament, which constantly tends to withdrawthem within the sheath : and they are atthe same time so connected with the tendons ofthe flexor muscles of the toes, that the momentthese muscles are thrown into action, which isthe case when the animal aims a stroke with itspaw, the claws are instantly drawn out, andcombine in inflicting the severest lacerations.*Connected with the superior strength of thehind extremities, we find the pelvis extendingfarther backwards, and more in a perpendicularline with the femur. This latter bone is longerand more slender than in the horse, but it ismore compact in its form, and its processes aremore strongly developed : the fibula is a separatebone from the tibia. The muscles, inThere exists, concealed in the tuft of hair, at the extremityof the lion's tail, a small conical and slightly curved claw, whichis attached to the skin only, and not to the last caudal vertebra :it is difficult to conjecture what can be its use.532 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.general, are more divided into portions, and arethus capable of greater diversity of action, at thesame time that they have greater power thanthose of herbivorous quadrupeds. The articularsurfaces are of greater extent, and are lubricatedwith a more copious supply of synovia ; theirligaments are more delicate and more numerous ;and the joints, in general, adapted to a greatervariety of movements. All these provisions areevidently directed to confer great freedom andfacility of motion, and to enlarge the sphere ofaction of the body generally, as well as*of thelimbs.§11. Quadrumana.We may trace in the series of quadrupeds whichhave come under our review a gradual increasein the development of the hind feet : beginningfrom the horse, which is single hoofed, orsolitude ; next to which rank the cloven-footedruminants, a tribe which includes the camel,whose foot is widely expanded for the purpose oftreading securely on sand ; then come theRhinoceros, which has three hoofed toes ; theHippopotamus, which has four, and the Elephant,which has five. To these succeed anotherseries, where nails, or claws, are substitutedfor hoofs, as is the case with all the Carnivora,which, standing on the extremities of their toes,MAMMALIA Quadrant. 533have been termed Digitigrades. Then followthe Plantigrade quadrupeds, such as the bear,the badger, the hedgehog, and the mole, whichrest with the whole foot on the ground, and arein consequence able to make great use of theirfore paws. These conduct us to the family ofthe Quadrumana, comprehending the Monkeyand the Lemur tribes, which are characterisedby having the inner toe quite distinct from theothers, like the human thumb, and which appear,therefore, as if they had four hands.The Quadrumana present the nearest approximationto the human structure : they, are naturallyinhabitants of the forest, and their conformationis adapted to the actions of climbing upontrees, of grasping the branches, and of springingfrom the one to the other, with precision andagility. It is here that they are at home ; it ishere that they gather the food which is most suitedto their nature ; it is here that they engage in successfulcombats with serpents and other enemies;retaining their positions in perfect security on themoving branches, or sportively swinging bytheir extremities in the air. Both the feet andthe hands are formed for this species of prehension; and many are further provided with astrongly prehensile tail, which is an instrumentadmirably adapted for all these purposes. Hencethe attitude most natural to these animals isneither the horizontal one of quadrupeds, nor the0.34 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.erect posture of man, but an intermediate orsemi-erect position.This view of the living habits of the quadrantwill afford the key to most of the peculiaritiesof structure they present to our observation.The head, being no longer suspended at the endof a horizontal, or recurved neck, is, in the usualattitude of the animal, supported chiefly by thecervical vertebrae. The greater development ofthe brain, and more especially of its posteriorlobes, creates a necessity for an extension of theoccipital bone in that direction ; a portion of theweight to be sustained by the atlas is accordinglythrown behind the centre of motion, which is atits articulation with the latter bone ; and thisweight tends, therefore, to balance that of theanterior part of the head ; hence there is no needof the strong cervical ligament, which is so universallymet with in quadrupeds, and althoughthis ligament exists in the monkey, it is veryslender, and of no very great extent.Great mobility has been conferred on thespine by the form of its articulations ; and thecaudal vertebrae are generally greatly multipliedto form a tail of considerable length, which in theAteles, or spider monkey of America, is moved bypowerful muscles, and is an organ of great flexibilityand strength. Monkeys possess a distinctclavicle, a lengthened humerus and femur, aradius and ulna moveable upon each other, andMAMMALIA Quadrant. 535a hand nearly approaching to the human construction.But the thumb is less developed, andits muscles are much weaker than in man.The bones of the pelvis, as well as those ofthe leg are elongated, for the purpose of givinggreater length to the muscles which are to movetheir several parts ; by this means, although theforce with which they act may be somewhat lessened,yet the velocity of the motion they produceis increased in the same proportion. Thefibula is here a bone of more importance than inquadrupeds ; for it performs a motion of rotationround the tibia, analogous to that of the radiusupon the ulna, giving a great extent of action tothe foot, and converting the leg into an arm, aswe have already seen that the foot itself is transformedinto a hand. A small inclination is givento the articulation of the tarsus with these lastmentioned bones, which imparts a degree oftwist to the feet, throwing the sole inwards, andcausing the monkey while walking to rest chieflyon its outer edge. This seeming defect gives aslight appearance of awkwardness to the gait ;it is not, however, to be viewed as an imperfection,for it is evidently designed to assist the animalin climbing trees, which is its most usualaction, the oblique position of the foot enablingit most effectually to lay hold of the branches.Monkeys are evidently not formed to excel inswiftness ; for the heel, in these animals, presents536 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.no large projection, as in other orders of mammalia;nor are the muscles that are insertedinto the heel particularly powerful ; they hardly,indeed, can be said to compose a calf as in thehuman leg.§ 12. Man.The series of structures modelled on the characteristictype of the Mammalia, after having exhibitedthe successive development of all itselements, attains the highest perfection in thehuman fabric : for even independently of thoseprerogatives of intellect and of sensibility, bywhich Man is so far exalted above the level ofthe brute creation, both his physical structureand his physiological constitution place him incontestablyat the summit of the scale of terrestrialbeings. Considered zoologically, indeed,the human species must rank among the Mammalia,and it even makes a near approach tothe Quadrumana ; yet there exist many peculiaritiesof structure, which entitle Man to be placedin a separate order, where disclaiming any closealliance with inferior creatures, he proudlystands alone, towering far above them all.It is not, however, on a pre-eminence in anysingle physical quality or function that this titleTHE HUMAN FRAME. 537to superiority can be founded ; for in each of theseendowments man is excelled in turn by particularraces of the lower animals ; but the chief perfectionof his frame consists in its general adaptationto an incomparably greater variety of objects,and an infinitely more expanded sphereof action. As the beauty of an edifice dependsnot on the elaborate finishing of any one portion,but results from the general suitableness of thewhole to the purposes for which it was constructed,so the excellence of the human fabric is to beestimated by the exquisite proportion and harmonysubsisting among all its parts, and pervadingthe whole system of its functions. Thedesign of its structure and economy embraceswidely different, and far higher aims than thosecontemplated in the organization of any of theinferior animals. Destined to an intellectual, asocial, and a moral existence, Man has hadevery part of his organization modified with anexpress relation to these great objects of his formation.This will best appear when we come toexamine the organs which are subservient tothe sensitive and active faculties ; but evenhere, where our views must, for the present, belimited to the mechanical circumstances of hisstructure, the proofs are sufficiently numerous towarrant this general conclusion.Man presents the only instance among themammalia of a conformation by which the erect538 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.posture can be permanently maintained, and inwhich the office of supporting the trunk of thebody is consigned exclusively to the lower extremities.To this intention the form and arrangementof all the parts of the osseous fabric, andthe position and adjustments of the organs ofsense have a well marked reference.* Thelower limbs are qualified to be the efficient instrumentsof progression by their greater lengthand muscularity, compared with the generalityof quadrupeds. The only exceptions to this ruleoccur in those mammalia which are constructedexpressly for leaping, such as the Kanguroo andJerboa, where, however, the hind legs are employedalmost solely for that mode of progression.The Quadrumana, which come nearer to thehuman form than any of the other tribes, have thelower limbs comparatively weak. In almost allother quadrupeds the disproportion is still greater,the thigh being short, and almost concealed bythe muscles of the trunk, and the remainder ofthe limb being slender, and not surrounded byany considerable mass of muscles.In most quadrupeds, as we have seen, the thorax is deep inthe direction from the sternum to the spine, but is compressedlaterally, for the evident purpose of bringing the fore limbsnearer to each other, that they might more effectually supportthe anterior part of the trunk. In Man, on the contrary, the thoraxis flattened anteriorly, and extends more in width than indepth ; thus throwing out the shoulders, and allowing an extensiverange of motion to the arms.THE HUMAN FRAME. 539The articular surfaces of the knee joint arebroader, and admit of greater extent of motionin man than in quadrupeds : hence the leg canbe brought into the same line with the thigh,and form with it a straight and firm column ofsupport to the trunk ; and the long neck of thethigh bone allows of more complete rotation.The widely spread basin of the pelvis effectuallysustains the weight of the digestive organs, andthey rest more particularly upon the broad expansionof the iliac bones : in quadrupeds, thesebones, having no such weight to support, aremuch narrower.The base on which the whole body is supportedin the erect position is constituted by thetoes, and by the heel, the bone of which projectsbackwards at right angles to the leg. Betweenthese points the sole of the foot has a concavityin two directions, the one longitudinal, the othertransverse, constituting a double arch. Thisconstruction, besides conferring strength andelasticity, provides room for the convenient passageof the tendons of the toes, which proceeddownwards from the larger muscles of the leg,and also for the lodgement of smaller musclesaffixed to each individual joint, and for the protectionof the various nerves and blood vesselsdistributed to all these parts. The concavity ofthe foot adapts it also to retain a firmer hold ofthe inequalities of the ground on which we540 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.tread. The muscles which raise the heel, andwhich compose the calf of the leg, are of greatsize and strength, and derive a considerable increaseof power from the projection of the boneof the heel, into which their united tendons areinserted. In all these respects the human structurepossesses decided advantages over that ofthe monkey, with reference to the specific objectsof its formation.It is impossible to doubt that nature intendedman to assume the erect attitude, when weadvert to the mode in which the head is placedon the spinal column. The enormous developmentof the brain, and of the bones which investit, increases so considerably the weight of thatpart of the head, which is situated behind itsarticulation with the vertebrae of the neck, thatthe balance of the whole is much more equalthan it is in the monkey, where the weight ofthe fore part very greatly preponderates. Themuscles which bend the head back upon theneck, and retain it in its natural position, aretherefore not required to be so powerful as theymust be in quadrupeds, especially in those whichgraze, and in which the mouth and eyes mustfrequently be directed downwards, for the purposeof procuring food. In man this attitudewould, if continued, be extremely fatiguing, fromthe weakness of those muscles, and the absenceof that strong ligament which sustains the weightTHE HUMAN FRAME. 541of the head in the ordinary horizontal attitude ofquadrupeds.Pronaque cum expectant animals caetera terram,Os domini sublime dedit, caelumque pueriJussit, et erects ad sisera toller vultus"— Ovid.The space comprehended by the two feet isextremely narrow, when compared with the extendedbase on which the quadruped is supported.Hence the stability of the body mustbe considerably less. The statue of an elephantplaced upon a level surface, would stand withoutdanger of oversetting : but the statue of a manresting on the feet, in the usual attitude ofstanding, would be thrown down by a very smallimpulse. It is evident, indeed, that in the livingbody, if the centre of gravity were at any momentto pass beyond the base, no musculareffort which could then be made would avail toprevent the body from falling. But the actionsof the muscles are continually exerted to preventthe yielding of the joints under the weight of thebody, which tends to bend them. In quadrupedsless exertion is requisite for that purpose ; andstanding is in them, as we have seen, a postureof comparative repose : in man it requires nearlyas great an expenditure of muscular power asthe act of walking Soldiers on parade experiencemore fatigue by remaining in the attitudeof standing, than they would by marching during542 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.an equal time. Strictly speaking, indeed, it isimpossible for even the strongest man to remainon his legs, in precisely the same position, forany considerable length of time. The muscles inactionsoon become fatigued, and require to berelieved by varying the points of support, so as tobring other muscles into play. Hence the weightof the body is transferred alternately from one footto the other. The action of standing consists infact, of a series of small and imperceptible motions,by which the centre of gravity is perpetuallyshifted from one part of the base to another; the tendency to fall to any one side beingquickly counteracted by an insensible movementin a contrary direction. Long habit has renderedus unconscious of these exertions, which we are,nevertheless, continually making ; but a childlearning to walk finds it difficult to accomplishthem successfully. It is one among those artswhich he has to acquire, and which costs him inthe apprenticeship many painful efforts, andmany discouraging falls. But whenever natureis the teacher, the scholar makes rapid progressin learning ; and no sooner have the musclesacquired the necessary strength, than the childbecomes an adept in balancing its body in variousattitudes, and in a very short time is unconsciousthat these actions require exertion.In walking, the first effort that is made consistsin transferring the whole weight of the bodyPROGRESSIVE MOTION IN MAN. 543upon one foot, with a view to fix it on the ground ;and then the other foot, being at liberty, isbrought forwards. By this action the centre ofgravity is made to advance, till it passes beyondthe base of the foot : in this situation the body,being unsupported, falls through a certain space,and would continue its descent, were it not thatit is received on the other foot, which, by thistime, has been set upon the ground. This fallingof the body would, if not immediately checked,become very sensible; as happens when, onwalking inattentively, the foot we had advancedcomes down to a lower level than we were preparedfor ; in which case the body, having acquireda certain velocity by its greater descent,receives a sudden shock when that velocity ischecked, and thus a disagreeable jar is given tothe whole frame.While the weight of the body is thus transferredalternately from one foot to the other, thecentre of gravity not only rises and falls, so asto describe at every step a small arch, but alsovibrates from side to side, so that the series ofcurves it describes are somewhat complicated intheir form. This undulation of the body fromone foot to the other would scarcely ever be performedwith perfect equality on both sides, if wetrusted wholly to the sensations communicatedby the muscles, and if we were not guided bythe sense of sight, or some other substitute. Thus544 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.a person blindfolded cannot walk far in a straightline ; for, even on a level plane, he will inclineunconsciously either to the right or to the left.In all quadrupeds, and even also in the quadrant,the fore extremities more or less contributeto the support and progression of the body :it is only in man that they are wholly exemptedfrom these offices, and are at liberty to be appliedto other purposes, and employed as instrumentsof prehension and of touch. In the power ofexecuting an infinite variety of movements andof actions, requiring either strength, delicacy, orprecision, the human arm and hand, consideredin their mechanism alone, are structures of unrivalledexcellence ; and, when viewed in relationto the intellectual energies to which theyare subservient, plainly reveal to us the divinesource, from which have emanated this exquisiteworkmanship, and these admirable adjustments,so fitted to excite in our breasts the deepestveneration, and to fill us with never ceasingwonder.To specify all the details of express contrivancein the mechanical conformation of the handwould alone fill a separate treatise : but I mustrefrain from pursuing this interesting subject,as, fortunately, the task has devolved upon onefar more able than myself to do it justice.Chapter X.VERTEBRATA CAPABLE OF FLYING.§ 1. Vertebrata without Feathers, formed for flying.Few problems in mechanic art present greaterpractical difficulties than that of raising fromthe ground, and of sustaining and moving rapidlythrough the air an animal body, composed as itmust be of many ponderous organs, that are requisitefor the performance of the higher functionsof life : yet Nature has achieved all this,not only in endless tribes of the more diminutiveinvertebrate animals, but also in the more solidand massive organizations which are modelledon the vertebrate type. These objects have beenaccomplished, in all cases, without the employmentof any other than the ordinary elements ofthose organizations ; modified, indeed, to suitthe particular purpose in view, but yet essentiallythe same, and regulated by the same laws ofdevelopment which prevail throughout the wholeanimal system. The adaptation of these elementsto the construction of an apparatus of sorefined a nature as that which is required forflying, implies the deepest foresight, the mostVOL. I. N N546 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.extensive plan, and the most artificial combinationof means. The foundations for these peculiarforms of mechanism are laid in the primevalconstitution of the embryo ; and a long and curiousseries of preparatory changes must take placebefore the completion of the finished structures.Of this we have already had a remarkable examplein the metamorphoses of insects, whichexhibit, in their last stage of development, thehighest degree of perfection compatible with thearticulate type. Birds, in like manner, presentus with the highest refinement of mechanicalconformation which can be attained by the developmentof a vertebrated structure.The power of flying is derived altogether fromthe resistance which the air opposes to bodiesmoving through it, or acting upon it by mechanicalimpulse. In the ordinary movements ofour own bodies, this resistance is scarcely sensible,and hardly ever attracts notice : but itincreases in proportion to the surface which actsupon the air, and still more according to thevelocity of the moving body ; for the increase isnot merely in the simple ratio of the velocity,but as its square, or perhaps even a higherpower. In order that an animal may be ableto fly, therefore, two principal conditions arerequired: there must, first, be a considerableextent of surface in the wings, or instrumentswhich act upon the air; and there must, se-powerOF FLYING. 547fondly, be sufficient muscular power to givethese instruments a very great velocity. Boththese advantages are found combined in the anteriorextremities of birds, and no animals belongingto any other class possess them in thesame perfection. No quadruped, except the bat,has sufficient muscular power in its limbs, howeveraided by an expansion of surface, to strikethe air with the force requisite for flight. Norefinement of mechanic ingenuity has everplaced the Daedalian art of flying within thereach of human power ; for even if the lightestpossible wings could be so artificially adapted tothe body as to receive the full force of the actionsof the limbs, however these actions mightbe combined, they would fall very far short ofthe exertion necessary for raising the body fromthe ground.Examples, however, occur in every one ofthe classes of vertebrated animals, where anapproach is made to this faculty. In the ,or flying-fish, the pectoral fins have beenenormously expanded, evidently for the purposeof enabling the animal to leap out of the water,and support itself for a short interval in the air :but its utmost efforts are inadequate to sustainit beyond a few moments in that element, andit can never rise to more than five or six feetabove the surface of the water.A species of lizard, called the Draco Volans,548 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.has a singularly constructed apparatus, whichappears like two wings, affixed to the sides ofthe back, and quite independent of either thefore or the hind extremities. By the aid ofthese moveable flaps, the animal is able to descendfrom the tops of trees, or flutter lightlyfrom branch to branch : but this is the utmostthat it can accomplish by means of these imperfectorgans. The construction of these anomalousmembers is highly curious in a physiologicalpoint of view ; as showing how Nature, ineffecting a new purpose, is inclined to resort tothe modification of structures already establishedas constituent parts of the frame, in preferenceto creating new organs, or such as have no prototypein the model of its formation. Frequentproofs of this law, indeed, are afforded by thecomparative examination of the anatomy of theorgans of progressive motion. The ribs, in particular,are often the subject of these conversionsto uses very different from their ordinary function,which is that of assisting in respiration.Thus we have seen that in the Tortoise they areexpanded to form the carapace, uniting withcorresponding dilatations of the sternum, andsterno-costal appendages, in composing a generalosseous engagement to the body. In Serpents,again, the ribs are employed as organs ofprogressive motion ; performing the functions oflegs, and having affixed to their extremities theFLYING LIZARD. 549abdominal scuta, by way of feet. The cervicalribs of the Cobra de Capelle, or hooded snake ofthe East Indies, are employed for the mechanicalpurpose of supporting an expansion of theskin of the neck, which forms a kind of hood,capable of being raised or depressed at the pleasureof the animal.* These ribs are entirelyunconnected with the respiration of the serpent.In the Draco volans, which was to be furnishedwith instruments for assisting it in itsdistant leaps through the air, it is again the ribswhich are resorted to for furnishing the basis ofsuch an apparatus. On each side of the dorsalvertebrae, as is seen in the skeleton of this animal(Fig. 222), the eight posterior ribs on each side,instead of having the usual curvature inwards,and instead of being continued round to encirclethe body, are extended outwards and elongated,and are covered with a thin cuticle, derived fromthe common integuments. The ordinary muscleswhich move the ribs still remain, but withgreatly increased power, and serve to flap thesestrangely formed wings at the pleasure of theanimal, during its short aerial excursions.Among the mammalia we meet with a fewspecies, which have a broad membrane, formedof a duplicate of the skin, extended like acloak from the fore to the hind extremities, and> Phil. Trans, for 1804, p. 346.THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.enabling the animal to flutter in the air, andto break its fall during its descent from thebranches of trees. Structures of this kind arepossessed by the Scours volans, or flying squirrel,and also by some other species of the samegenus. They are seen on a still larger scale in theLemur volans, or Cercopithecus. The resistancewhich these broad expansions of skin oppose tothe air, when the limbs are spread out, enablesthe animal to descend in perfect safety throughthat medium from very considerable heights :but these appendages to the body are mere parachutes,not wings, and none of the animals whichBAT. 551possess them can, by their means, and with theutmost efforts which their muscles are capableof exerting, ever rise from the ground, or evensuspend themselves for a moment in the air.The only quadruped that can properly be saidto be endowed with the power of flying is theBat. In this animal the portions of the skeleton(f, Fig. 223) which correspond to the phalangesof the fingers are extended to an enormouslength, and the pectoral muscles, whichmove the anterior extremities, are of extraordinarysize and power. In the larger species,each wing is at least two feet in length. Thefine membrane, which is spread between theselengthened fingers, has its origin in the sides ofthe neck, and reaches all along the body to theextremities of the hinder legs, which it enclosesin its folds. Thus, not only is the surface, bywhich it acts upon the air, sufficiently extensive,but the muscular power, by which its motionsare effected, is adequate to give it those quick552 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.and sadden impulses which are requisite forflying : and thus, although its structure is totallydifferent from that of birds, it yet performsfully the office of a real wing. The bat flieswith perfect ease, even while carrying alongwith it one or two of its young : it is not,however, fitted for very long flights.The conformation of the skeleton is adapted tothis new and important function. The chest isbroad and capacious to admit of free respirationwhile the animal is flying, and to afford amplespace for the attachment of the large muscleswhich have become necessary. The scapulae(s) are large, and of a singular form, and theyare kept at a considerable distance asunder bythe expanded chest: their coracoid processesare also large, and extend in the direction of thesternum. The clavicles (c) are of enormous sizeand length, being larger than either the scapulaor the sternum, and remarkably curved in theirshape. The sternum is much developed, extendinglaterally, and having a projecting crestalong the middle of its lower surface. The humerus(h) is strong, but short; apparently inorder to avoid the danger of its being snappedasunder by the violent actions of the pectoralmuscles, had it been longer. As the leadingobject of the structure is to give power to thewing, there was no necessity for the rotatorymotion of the bones of the fore-arm ; and AT. 553accordingly we find them consolidated into one (r) ;or rather no part of the ulna is developed, exceptthe process of the olecranon, or elbow, which hasbecome soldered to the radius.These advantages in the construction of thefore extremities are obtained at the expense ofthe hinder, which are too feeble to support theweight of the body in the upright positionrequired for walking, in consequence of thecentre of gravity being between the wings. Ona level plane, indeed, the bat can advanceonly by a kind of crawling or hopping motion.The whole anterior half of the trunk is muchmore fully developed than the posterior half,which appears as if it had been checked in itsgrowth. The pelvis (p) is of diminutive size,compared with the rest of the skeleton : thepubic bones are lengthened backwards, and arejoined merely at a small point. The wholeposterior limb is short, the femur (f) comparativelylong, and the fibula is a very slenderbone, yet quite distinct from the tibia (t).The slight degree of motion which is thus allowedbetween them is useful to the animal,in enabling the feet to lay hold of cornicesor other projecting parts of the roofs of buildings,on which the animal fastens itself, andhangs with the head downwards. It is probablywith the intention of facilitating this actionthat the toes are turned completely THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.wards ; and that they are of a curved shape, andgenerally armed with sharp claws. A bony appendix(a) projects outwards from the heel, forthe purpose of supporting the hinder prolongationof the membrane, which often extends betweenthe hind feet, and is further sustained bythe tail, in those species which have the spineprolonged to form one.Bats are also provided with another instrumentfor suspending themselves to projectingobjects, formed by the thumb (b), which is, apparentlyfor this express purpose, detached fromthe fingers that support the wing, and is terminatedby a strong claw, which projects, evenwhen the wings are folded, and is useful inprogression, serving as a point of support.§ 2. Birds.It is in Birds alone that we find the most perfectadaptation of structure to the purposes of rapidand extensive flight : in them the frame of theskeleton, the figure, position, and structure ofthe wings, the size of the muscles, the peculiarnature of their irritability, and even theoutward form of the body have all a direct andbeautiful relation to the properties of the elementin which Nature has intended them to move.BIRDS. 555In their formation a new, and in as far as relatesto the organs of progressive motion, a more developedtype is adopted ; still preserving a conformitywith the general plan of the vertebralorganization, and with the general laws of itsdevelopment.The skeleton of birds has the same constituentparts as that of other vertebrated classes : thebones of the anterior extremity, though destinedexclusively to support the wing, retain the samedivisions, and are composed of the usual elements: and the general form of the body is thatbest calculated to glide through the air with theleast resistance. As birds swallow their foodentire, there is no necessity for any part of thebulky apparatus of hard and solid teeth, largemuscles and heavy jaws which are required bymost quadrupeds: hence the head admits ofbeing greatly reduced in its dimensions; andthe form of the beak, which is drawn to a point,and cuts the opposing air, tends to facilitate theprogress of the bird in its flight.In the conformation of the body, also, everycircumstance that could contribute to give itlightness has been sedulously studied. Thegeneral size of birds is considerably smallerthan quadrupeds of corresponding habits. Nowherehas Nature attempted to endow a hugeponderous animal, like the fabled Pegasus,with the power of flight. Great condensation556 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.has been given to the osseous substance,*in order that the greatest degree of strengthmight be procured with the same weight of solidmaterials ; and the mechanical advantage derivedfrom their being disposed in the circumferencerather than in central masses, has been obtainedto the utmost extent. The horny material, ofwhich the stems of the feathers are constructed,are, in like manner, formed into hollow cylinders,which, compared with their weight, areexceedingly strong. A similar shape has beengiven to the cylindrical bones, which are fashionedinto tubes with dense but thin sides : most of theother bones have likewise been made hollow, andinstead of their cavities being filled with marrow,they contain only air. | Thus the whole skeletonis rendered remarkably light : that of the Pelicansonocrotalus, for instance, or white Pelican,which is five feet in length, was found by theParisian Academicians to weigh only twenty-threeounces, while the entire bird weighednearly twenty-five pounds. The cavities in thebones communicate with large air cells, whichare distributed in various parts of the body, andOssification not only proceeds more rapidly, but is alsocarried to a greater extent in this class of animals than in anyother ; as a proof of which, the tendons, especially those of themuscles of the legs, are frequently ossified.f In the bat there is no provision of this kind for lighteningthe bones, and we find them containing marrow, as in othermammalia, and not air.BIRDS. 557which contribute still further to diminish itsspecific gravity : and by means of canals whichopen into the air passages of the lungs, this airfinds a ready outlet when it becomes rarefied bythe ascent of the bird into the higher regions ofthe atmosphere.*The conditions in which a bird is placed withregard to the density of the surrounding medium,as well as their mode of progression, areso opposite to those of fishes, that we shouldexpect to find great corresponding differences intheir conformation. These two classes of vertebrata,accordingly, are remarkably contrastedThis air, being contained in the interior of the body, whichpreserves a very elevated temperature, must be constantly in astate of greater rarefaction than the cooler external air ; a conditionwhich must contribute in some slight degree to render thewhole body lighter than it would otherwise have been. It appearsto me, however, that considerably greater importance hasbeen attached to this circumstance than it really possesses.Many have gone so far as to represent the condition of a bird asapproaching to that of a balloon filled with a lighter gas thanatmospheric air: and have been lavish in their expressions ofadmiration at the beauty of the contrivance which thus converteda living structure into an aerostatic machine. A littlesober consideration will suffice to show that the amount of thesupposed advantages resulting to the bird from the diminutionof weight, occasioned by the difference of temperature betweenthe air included in its body and the external atmosphere, is perfectlyinsignificant. Any one who will take the trouble to calculatethe real diminution of weight arising from this cause, underthe most favourable circumstances, will find that, even in the caseof the largest bird, it can never amount to more than a fewgrains.558 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.with respect to the structure of their skeletons.In fishes we have seen that the chest and all theviscera are carried as far forwards as possible ;the respiratory organs and the centre of circulationbeing close to the head, the neck havingdisappeared, and the trunk being continued intothe lengthened tail, in which the chief bulk ofthe muscles are situated. In birds, on the contrary,the ribs, and the viscera which they protect,are placed as far back along the spinalcolumn as possible ; and a long and flexible neckextends from the trunk to the head, which isthus carried considerably forwards. These circumstancesare very apparent in the skeleton ofthe swan, represented in Fig. 224. In the fish,progressive motion is effected principally by themovements of the tail, which impels the bodyalternately from side to side : in the bird, theonly instruments of motion are the wings, whichare affixed to the fore part of the trunk, and aremoved by muscles situated in that region. Inthe fish, the spine is flexible nearly throughoutits whole extent ; in the bird, it is rigid and immoveablein the trunk, and is capable of extensivemotion only in the neck.In order that the body may be exactly balancedwhile the bird is flying, its centre ofgravity must be brought precisely under the lineconnecting the articulations of the wings withthe trunk, for it is at these points that the re-birds.distance of the air causes it to be supported bythe wings. When the bird is resting upon itslegs, the centre of gravity must, in like manner,be brought immediately over the base of supportformed by the toes : it becomes necessary, therefore,to provide means for shifting the centre ofgravity from one place to another, according to560 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.circumstances, and to adjust its position withconsiderable nicety; otherwise there would bedanger of the equilibrium being destroyed, andthe body oversetting. The principal means ofeffecting these adjustments consist in the motionsof the head and neck, which last is, forthat purpose, rendered exceedingly long andflexible. The number of cervical vertebrae isgenerally very considerable ; in the mammalia,as we have seen, there are always seven, but inmany birds there are more than twice that number.In the swan (Fig. 224), there are twenty-three,and they are joined together by articulations,generally allowing free motion in all directions; that is, laterally, as well as forwardsand backwards. This unusual degree of mobilityis conferred by a peculiar mechanism,which is not met with in the other classes ofvertebrated animals. A cartilage is interposedbetween each of the vertebrae, to the surfaces ofwhich these cartilages are curiously adapted,being enclosed between folds of the membranelining the joint: so that each joint is in realitydouble, consisting of two cavities, with an interveningcartilage.*It is to be observed, however, that in consequenceof the positions of the oblique processes,See Mr. H. Earle's paper on this subject in the PhilosophicalTransactions for 1823, p. 277.BIRDS. 581the upper vertebrae of the neck bend with morefacility forwards than backwards ; while thosein the lower half of the neck bend more readilybackwards : hence, in a state of repose, theneck naturally assumes a double curvature, likethat of the letter S, as is well seen in the gracefulform of the swan's neck. By extending theneck in a straight line, the bird can, whileflying, carry forwards the centre of gravity, soas to bring it under the wings ; and when restingon its feet, or floating on the water, it can transferthat centre backwards, so as to bring it towardsthe middle of the body, by merelybending back the neck into the curved formwhich has just been described ; and thus theequilibrium is, under all circumstances, preservedby movements remarkable for theirelegance and grace.*Another advantage arising from the lengthand mobility of the neck is, that it facilitates theapplication of the head to every part of the surfaceof the body. Birds require this power inorder that they may be enabled to adjust theirplumage, whenever it has by any accident becomeruffled. In aquatic birds, it is necessaryThe great mobility of the neck enables the bird to employits beak as an organ of prehension for taking its food : an objectwhich was the more necessary, in consequence of the conversionof the fore extremities into wings, of which the structure is incompatiblewith any prehensile power, such as is often possessedby the anterior extremity of a quadruped.VOL. I. O O562 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.that every feather should be constantly anointedwith an oily secretion, which preserves it frombeing wetted, and which is copiously provided forthat purpose by glands situated near the tail.The flexibility of the neck alone would havebeen insufficient for enabling the bird to bringits bill in contact with every feather, in order todistribute this fluid equally over them ; andthere is, accordingly, a farther provision made forthe accomplishment of this object in the modeof articulation of the head with the neck. Wehave seen that, in fishes, and in most reptiles,this articulation consists of a ball and socketjoint ; a rounded tubercle of the occipital bonebeing received into a hemispherical depressionin the first vertebra of the neck. In the mammaliathe plan is changed, and there are twoarticular surfaces, one on each side of the spinalcanal, formed on processes corresponding to theleaves of the first cranial vertebra, and assimilatingit more to a hinge joint. In birds, however,where, as we have just seen, the most extensivelateral motions are required, the planof the ball and socket joint is again resorted to ;and the occipital bone is made to turn upon theatlas by a single pivot. So great is the freedomof motion in this joint, that the bird can readilyturn its head completely back upon its neck, oneither side.As spinous or transverse processes of anylength would have interfered with the flexionsBIRDS. $63of the neck, we find scarcely a trace of theseprocesses in the cervical vertebrae of birds. Butanother, and a still more important considerationwas to be attended to in the construction ofthis part of the spine. It must be recollectedthat the spinal marrow passes down along thecanal formed by the arches of the vertebrae,and that any pressure applied to its tendersubstance would instantly paralyze the wholebody, and speedily put an end to life. Someextraordinary provision was therefore requiredto be made, in order to guard against thepossibility of this accident occurring during themany violent contortions into which the columnis liable to be thrown. This is accomplished inthe simplest and most effectual manner by enlargingthe diameter of the canal at the upperand lower part of each vertebra, while at the225 ^ middle it remains of theusual size, so that theshape of the cavity, asis well seen in Fig. 225,which shows a verticalsection of one of thecervical vertebrae of theostrich, resembles thatof an hour glass.* Thusa wide space is left atthe junction of each successive vertebra, allowingFor the specimen from which this engraving was made, Iam indebted to the kindness of Mr. Owen.564 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.of very considerable flexion, without reducingthe diameter of the canal beyond that of thenarrow portion, and therefore without producingcompression of the spinal marrow. Mr. Earlefound t that vertebra? united in this manner maybebent backwards to a right angle, and laterallyto half a right angle, without injury to the enclosednervous substance. The design of thisstructure is further evident from its not existingin the dorsal and lumbar portions of the spine,which admit of no motion whatever, and wherethere is no variation in the diameter of the spinalcanal.A plan entirely different is followed in thevertebrae of the back and loins. For the purposeof ensuring the proper actions of the wings, thegreat object here is to prevent motion, and togive all possible strength and security ; and accordinglythe whole of this portion of the spine,together with the sacrum, is consolidated intoone piece. All the processes are largely developed,and pass obliquely from one vertebra tothe next, mutually locking them together : and,in order most effectually to preclude the possibilityof any flexion, the spinous processes, andsometimes even the bodies of the dorsal vertebraeare immoveable soldered together by ossific matter,so as to form one continuous bone.The sacrum (v, Fig. 224) consists of the unionof a great number of vertebrae, as many as twentyf In the paper already quoted, p. 278.BIRDS. 565being anchylosed together for this purpose ; sothat they form a bone of great length. Thecoccygeal vertebrae (q) are also numerous, butare compressed into a small space, and enjoygreat latitude of motion, being subservient to themovements of the tail.The ribs are numerous, and of considerablestrength : they send out processes, which aredirected backwards, passing over the next ribbefore they terminate, and giving very effectualsupport to the walls of the chest. The ribs arecontinued along the abdomen, and afford protectionto the viscera in that cavity ; and somearise even from the sacrum, and from the iliacbones. Those which are in front are united tothe sternum (s) by means of sternal appendices,which are ossified, and appear as the continuationsof the ribs, or as if the ribs were jointedin the middle.The sternum is of enormous size, extendingover a considerable part of the abdomen, andhaving a large perpendicular crest descending,like the keel of a ship, from its lower surface.The object of this great development is tofurnish extensive attachment to the large pectoralmuscles employed to move the wings, and which,taken together, are generally heavier than therest of the body. Considered with reference toall the other muscles, and to the weight of thebody itself, these pectoral muscles are of enormousstrength. The flap of a swan's wing is566 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.capable of breaking a man's leg ; and a similarblow from an eagle has been known to beinstantly fatal. The bat is the only instance,among the mammalia, where the sternum presentsthis peculiar carinated, or keel-like shape :and the purpose is evidently the same as in thebird.*The scapula is generally a small and slenderbone. The coracoid bone (k) is largely developed,and assumes much of the appearance of aclavicle But the real clavicles (c) are unitedbelow, where they join the fore part of thesternum, appearing as one bone, which, from itsforked shape, has been denominated thefurcularbone. In the fowl it is commonly known by thename of the merry-thought. This bone, placedat the origin of the wings, and stretching fromthe one to the other, is of great importance asconstituting a firm basis for their support, andfor securing their steadiness of action ; and being,at the same time, very elastic, it tends to restorethem to their proper situations, after they havebeen disturbed by any violent impulse.Notwithstanding the great modification the sternum hasreceived in the bird, when compared with its form in the tortoiseand the quadruped, we may still trace the same nine elementsentering into its composition, though developed in very differentproportions.+ Many have considered this bone as being the clavicle, andhave regarded the circular bone as a new bone, or supplementaryclavicle : but all the analogies of position and of developmentare in favour of the views stated in the text,WING OF BIRDS* 567The wing of a bird does not, at first view,present much analogy with the fore extremity ofa quadruped : but on a closer examination wefind it to contain all the principal bones of thelatter, though somewhat altered in shape, andstill more changed in their functions. Yet stillthe same unity of plan, and perfect harmony ofexecution may be discerned in the mechanism ofthis refined instrument of a higher mode of progression.The head of the humerus (h) has a compressedform; and in order to obtain great extent ofmotion, it is made to play by a very smallcylindrical surface upon the scapula ; thus admittingof the complete descent of the wing,unobstructed by any opposing process, but atthe same time limiting its motion to one plane.It is connected below, by broad attachments, tothe radius and ulna, forming with them a bingejoint. These latter bones are separate, and ofgreat length, but so firmly united together byligament as scarcely to have any motion on oneanother. The carpus (w), consists of two bonesonly, the one articulated with the radius, theother with the ulna. They move together as onepiece; but, contrary to what takes place inquadrupeds, the movements are made from sideto side, instead of their consisting of flexion andextension ; this variation from the usual structurebeing for the purpose of folding down thejoints of the wing, and bringing them close to568 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.the body. The metacarpus (m) consists originallyof two bones, which soon become unitedinto one at the upper part. On the radial sideit has a process, derived perhaps from a thirdmetacarpal bone, which is anchylosed at a stillearlier period of ossification ; and to this processa small pointed bone is connected, correspondingto a rudimental thumb (t). There are generallytwo fingers, of which the first exhibitstraces of having been originally two bones : theinner finger consists of two or three long phalanges,and the outer one of a single phalanx :there is sometimes also a rudimental bone correspondingto a little finger. The degree ofdevelopment of these bones varies in differenttribes of birds.Feathers are attached to all these divisions ofthe limb, namely, to the humerus, the fore arm,the hand, and occasionally to the single phalanxof the thumb. The structure of feathers iscalculated in an eminent degree to combine thequalities of lightness and of strength, which weelsewhere rarely find united. The horny materialsof which the stem of the quill is made aretough, pliant, and elastic ; and, as we havealready seen, are disposed in the most advantageousmanner for resisting flexion by beingformed into a hollow cylinder. But the vane ofthe feather is still more artificially constructed ;being composed of a number of flat threads, orFeather* OF BIRDS. 569filaments, so arranged as to oppose a muchgreater resistance to a force striking perpendicularlyagainst their surface, than to onewhich is directed laterally ; that is, in the planeof the stem. They derive this power of resistancefrom their flattened shape, which allowsthem to bend less easily in the direction of theirflat surfaces than in any other ; in the sameway that a slip of card cannot easily be bent bya force acting in its own plane, though itlily yields to one at right angles to it. Nowit is exactly in the direction in which they donot bend that the filaments of the feather haveto encounter the resistance and impulse of theair. It is here that strength is wanted, and it ishere that strength has been bestowed.On examining the assemblage of these laminatedfilaments still more minutely, we find that■they appear to adhere to one another. As wecannot perceive that they are united by anyglutinous matter, it is evident that their connexionmust be effected by some mechanisminvisible to the unassisted eye. By the aid ofthe microscope the mystery is unravelled, andV e discover the presence of a number of minutefibrils, arranged along the margin of the famine,and fitted to catch upon and clasp one another,whenever the lamina? are brought within a certaindistance. The fibrils oi a feather from thewing oi a goose are represented magnified atTHE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.a, a, b, b, Fig. 226, as they arise from the twosides of the edges of each lamina: they areexceedingly numerous, above a thousand beingcontained in the space of an inch ; and they areof two kinds, each kind having a different formand curvature. Those marked a, a, which arisefrom the side next to the extremity of the featherare branched or tufted, and bend downwards,while those marked b, b, proceeding from theother side of the lamina, or that nearest the rootof the feather, are shorter and firmer, and do notdivide into branches, but are hooked at the extremities,and are directed upwards. When thetwo laminae are brought close to one another,the long, curved fibrils of the one being carriedover the short and straight fibrils of the other,both sets become entangled together ; theircrooked ends fastening into one another, just asthe latch of a door falls into the cavity of thecatch which is fixed in the door-post to receiveFEATHERS OF BIRDS. 571it. The way in which this takes place will bereadily perceived by making a section of thevane of a feather across the lamina?, and examiningwith a good microscope their cut edges,while they are gently separated from one another.The appearance they then present isexhibited in Fig. 227, which shows distinctlythe form, direction, and relative positions of eachset of fibrils, and the manner in which they layhold of one another. This mechanism is repeatedover every part of the feather, and constitutesa closely reticulated surface of greatextent, admirably calculated to prevent the passageof the air through it, and to create by itsmotion that degree of resistance which it is intendedthe wing should encounter.* In feathersnot intended for flight, as in those of the ostrich,the fibrils are altogether wanting : in those ofthe peacock's tail, the fibrils, though large, havenot the construction which fits them for claspingthose of the contiguous lamina; and in otherinstances they do so very imperfectly.A construction so refined and artificial as theone I have been describing, and so perfectlyA very clear account of the mechanism described in thetext is given by Paley, in the 12th chapter of his " NaturalTheology."

The branched formof the upper fibrils, and the reticulated structure of the laminaethemselves, when viewed with a high magnifying power, areparticularly beautiful microscopic objects.572 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.adapted to the mechanical object which it is toanswer, cannot be contemplated without thedeepest feeling of admiration, and without themost eager curiosity to gain an insight into theelaborate processes, which, we cannot doubt, areemployed by nature in the formation of a fabricso highly finished, and displaying such minuteand curious workmanship. It is only very recentlythat we have been admitted to a closeinspection of the complicated machinery, whichis put in action in this branch of what may becalled organic architecture; and certainly noneis more fitted to call forth our profoundest wonderat the comprehensiveness of the vast scheme ofdivine providence, which extends its care equallyto the perfect construction of the minutest andapparently most insignificant portions of theorganized frame, whether it be the down of athistle, the scales of a moth, or the fibrils of afeather, as well as to the completion of the largerand more important organs of vitality.Every bird, on quitting the egg, is found tobe covered on all parts, except the under side,with a kind of down, consisting of minute filaments,collected in tufts, and resembling in theirarrangement the fibres of a camel-hair pencil.Each tuft contains about ten or twelve filaments,growing from the upper ends of bulbous rootsimplanted in the skin, and which are the rudimentsof the organs that afterwards form theFEATHERS OF BIRDS. 573feathers, of which this down, serving the purposeof a first garment, hastily spread over the youngbird, is but the precursor ; for the tufts generallysoon fall off and disappear, except in the rapacioustribes, as the eagle and the vulture, wherethey remain attached to the feathers for a considerabletime.While this temporary protection is given tothe integument, extensive preparations are makingunderneath for furnishing a more effectiveraiment, adapted to the future wants of the bird.The apparatus by which the feathers are to beformed is gradually constructing; and its rudimentsare receiving the necessary supply ofnutrient juices, and of vessels for their circulation,together with their usual complement ofnerves and absorbents. When first visible, thisorgan has the form of a very minute cone,attached by a filament proceeding from its baseto one of the papillae of the skin, and establishingits connexion with the living system. In thecourse of a few days, this cone has become elongatedinto a cylinder, with a pointed extremity,while its base is united to the skin by a moredistinct bond of connexion formed by the enlargedvessels, which are supplying it with nourishment.It is in the interior of this cylinderthat all the parts of the feather are constructed ;their earliest rudiments being formed at the upperpart, or apex of this organ ; and the materials574 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.of the several parts of the feather being successivelydeposited and fashioned into their propershapes in different places : for while the firstlaminae are constructing in one portion of thecylinder, the next are only just beginning to beformed in another ; and while the outer coveringof the stem is growing from one membrane, theinterior spongy tissue is deposited in other places,in various stages of softness or consolidation : sothat the whole composes a system of operations,which may be said to resemble in its complicationat least, although on a microscopic scale, an extensivemanufactory. Hence will be readilyunderstood how great must be the difficulty oftracing all the steps of these multifarious processes,which are carried on in so small a space :and this difficulty is much increased from thecircumstance that the organ in which they takeplace is itself only developed as the work proceeds,its different parts being produced successivelyin proportion as they are wanted, and theirform and structure undergoing frequent variationin the course of their development.The most elaborate, and apparently accurateresearches on this intricate subject, are thoselately undertaken by M. Frederick Cuvier, fromwhose memoir* I have selected the followingabridged statement of the principal results of hisMemoires du Museum, xiii. 327 ; and Annates des SciencesNaturelles, ix. 113.FEATHERS OF BIRDS.observations. It will be necessary in order toobtain a clear idea of the several steps of theprocess to be described, to advert to the structureof a feather in its finished state. For this purposewe need only examine a common feather,such as that represented in Fig. 228, where s is\1#the posterior surface of the solid stem, which, itwill be perceived, is divided into two parts by alongitudinal groove, and from either side of whichproceed a series of laminae, composing, with theirfibrils, what is termed the vane of the feather(v). The lines from which these laminae arise,576 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.approach one another at the lower part of thestem, till they meet at a point, where the longitudinalgroove terminates, and where there is asmall orifice (o), leading to the interior of thequill. From this part the transparent tubularportion of the quill (t) commences ; and at itslower extremity (l) there exists a second, or lowerorifice.The entire organ which forms the feather, andwhich may be termed its matrix, is representedin Fig. 229, when it has attained the cylindricform already described ; of which a is the apex,or conical part that rises above the cuticle, andb the base, by which it is attached to the corium,or true skin. A white line is seen running longitudinallythe whole length of the cylinder, andanother, exactly similar to it, is met with on theopposite side : the one corresponds in situationto the front, and the other to the back of thestem of the future feather. On laying open thematrix longitudinally, as is shown in Fig. 230, itis found to be composed of a sheath or capsule,and of a central pulpy mass, termed the bulb.The capsule consists of several membranouslayers (c, e, s, i), which are more consolidatednear the apex, and become gradually softer andmore delicate, as we trace them towards the baseof the matrix, where their formation is only beginningto take place.The laminae and their fibrils, the assemblageFEATHERS OF BIRDS. 577of which constitutes the vane of the feather, arethe parts which are first formed ; and their constructionis effected in the space between theouter capsule (c), and the central bulb (b), in amode which is exceedingly remarkable, anddifferent from that of the formation of any otherorganic product with which we are acquainted.Instead of growing from a base, like hairs, andother productions of the integuments, by successivedepositions of layers, the materials whichare to compose the laminae are cast in moulds,where they harden and acquire the exact shapeof the recipient cavities. The next object of ourcuriosity, then, is to learn the way in whichthese moulds are constructed ; and on carefulexamination they appear to be formed by twostriated membranes, the exterior one (e) envelopingthe other (i), or interior membrane.These membranes are separated by a series ofpartitions, which commence at the edges of thelongitudinal white band, seen in Fig. 229, andwind obliquely upwards till they reach theopposite longitudinal band already described,where they join a longitudinal partition whichoccupies a line answering to that posterior band.Thus they leave between them narrow spaces,which constitute so many compartments for thedeposition, as in a mould, of the material ofeach lamina. The course of these channels,and their junction at the back of the matrix isvol. i. p p578 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.seen at s, Fig. 230. It is exceedingly probable,though from the minuteness of the parts it isscarcely possible to obtain ocular demonstrationof the fact, that the fibrils of the laminae areformed in a similar manner, by being mouldedin still more minute compartments, formed bytransverse membranous partitions.The proper office of the bulb, after it has suppliedthe materials for the formation of thelaminae, is to construct the stem of the feather,and unite the laminae to its sides. For this purposethe anterior portion of the bulb deposits onits surface a plate of horny substance, whileanother plate is formed by the posterior part inthe interior of the bulb. Thus the bulb becomesdivided into two portions, one anterior and theother posterior. The former of these, afterhaving finished the external plate, proceeds toform the spongy substance, which is to connectthe two plates, and the posterior portion of thebulb embraces the inner plate, and graduallyfolds it inwards till its sides meet at the middlegroove along the back of the stem. The anteriorpart of the bulb, during the process of filling upthe stem, exhibits a series of conical shapedmembranes, as is seen in the section, Fig. 231 ;the points of the cones being directed upwards,and their intervals being occupied by the spongysubstance in different stages of consolidation,and more perfected in proportion as they aresituated nearer the apex of the stem.FEATHERS OF BIRDS. 579While the construction of the feather, in itsdifferent stages, is thus advancing from below,those parts which are completely formed, arerising above the surface of the skin, still envelopedin the capsule which originally protectedthem, but the upper portions of which, from theaction of the air, and the obliteration of thevessels that nourished them, now decaying,shrivel and fall off in shreds, allowing thesuccessive portions of the feather to come forth,and the laminae to unfold themselves as they riseand assume their proper shapes. This successiveevolution proceeds until the principal partsof the stem and of the vane are completed ; andthen a different kind of action takes place. Theposterior part of the bulb now contracts itself,and bringing the edges of that surface of thestem closer together at length unites them at thesuperior orifice (o), Fig. 228 ; where the laminae,which follow these lines, also terminate. Havingthus performed the office assigned to it, itceases to be nourished, and is incapable anylonger of depositing a horny covering to thefeather : all that remains of its substance is athin membrane which adheres to the outside ofthe tubular part or barrel of the quill, and whichmust be scraped off before the latter can beused as a pen. The tubular part is the productof the anterior part of the bulb, which nowceases to deposit the spongy substance, butforms a transparent horny material over the580 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.whole of its external surface ; but as it retirestowards the root, it leaves a succession of verythin pellucid membranes, in the form of cones,which, when dried, form what is termed the pithof the quill. The last remnant of the bulb isseen in the slender ligament which passesthrough the lower orifice, and preserves theattachment of the feather to the skin. In processof time, this also decays, and the wholefeather is cast off, preparatory to the formationof another, which in due season is to replace it.All the feathers are, in general, mounted annually,or even at shorter periods ; and the samecomplicated process is again begun and completedby a new matrix produced for the occasion,every time a new feather is to be formed.It is impossible, on reviewing these curiousfacts, not to be struck with the admirable art andforesight which are implied in all this long andcomplicated series of operations. While thebird was yet nourished by the fluids of the egg,the ground had already been prepared for itsfuture plumage, and for the formation of instrumentsof flight. A temporary investment ofdown is in readiness to shelter the tender chickenfrom the rude impressions of the air, and anapparatus is preparing for the construction ofthe most refined instruments for clothing andfor motion : first the scaffolding, as it may becalled, is erected, by the help of which each poringOF BIRDS. 581tion is built up in succession, and in properorder. Nature's next care is to construct thevane, which is the part of the feather most essentialto its office : and then to form the shaft,to which the vane is to be affixed, and fromwhich it receives its support : lastly, she formsthe barrel of the quill, which is prolonged for thepurpose of converting it into a lever of sufficientlength for the mechanical office it has to perform.In proportion as each structure is finished, sheneglects not to remove the scaffolding which hadbeen set up as a temporary structure ; the membranes,with all their partitions, are carried away,the vascular pulp of the bulb is absorbed, andits place supplied by air, thus securing theutmost lightness, without any diminution ofstrength. Is it possible for any rational mind,after meditating upon these facts, to arrive at thepersuasion that they are all the mere results ofchance ?Several circumstances remain to be noticedrespecting the structure and actions of the wingsof birds. If we attend to the mode of their articulationwith the scapula, we find it producinga motion oblique with regard to the axis of thebody, so that the stroke which they give to theair is directed both downwards and backwards ;and the bird, while moving forwards, is at thesame time supported in opposition to the force of582 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.gravity. The different portions of the wing arelikewise so disposed as to be contracted andfolded together when the wing is drawn up, butfully expanded when it descends in order tostrike the air. It is obvious that, without thisprovision, a great part of the motion acquired bythe resistance of the air against the wing in itsdescent would have been lost by a counteractingresistance during its ascent. The disposition ofthe great feathers is such that they strike the airwith their flat sides, but present only their edgesin rising : what is called feathering the oar inrowing is a similar operation, performed with thesame intention, and deriving its name from thisresemblance.As the inclination of the wing is chiefly backwards,the greatest part of the effect producedby its action is to move the body forwards.Birds of prey have a great obliquity of wing, andare consequently better formed for horizontalprogressive motion, which is what they chieflypractise in pursuing their prey, than for a rapidperpendicular ascent. Those birds, on the contrary,which rise to great heights in a directionnearly vertical, such as the Quail and the Lark,have the wings so disposed as to strike directlydownwards, without any obliquity whatsoever.For the same reason, birds rise better againstthe wind, which, acting upon the oblique surfacepresented by the wings during their flexion, contriveOF BIRDS. 583butes to the ascent of the body on the sameprinciple that a kite is carried up into the airwhen retained in an oblique position. This circumstanceis particularly observable in the ascentof birds of prey, whose wings have a great obliquity,and, when fully expanded, present a verylarge extent of surface.The actions of the tail, which operates as arudder, are useful chiefly in directing the flight.When the tail is short, this office is supplied bythe legs, which are in that case generally verylong ; and being raised high and extended backwardsin a straight line, are of considerableassistance in the steerage of the animal. Inmany birds, as in the wood-pecker, the tail ismuch employed as a support to the body inclimbing trees. The caudal vertebrae are oftennumerous, but are short and compressed together; they are remarkable for the great developmentof their transverse processes, and forhaving spinous processes both on their lowerand upper sides. The last vertebra, instead ofbeing cylindrical, has a broad carinated spinefor the insertion of large feathers.Birds could not, of course, be always on thewing; for a great expenditure of muscularpower is constantly going on while they supportthemselves in the air. Occasional rest is necessaryto them as well as to other animals, andmeans are accordingly provided by nature for584 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.their mechanical support and progressive motionwhile on land.The anterior extremities having been exclusivelyappropriated to flight, and constructedwith reference to the properties of the atmosphere,the offices of sustaining and of movingthe body along the ground must be entrustedwholly to the hind limbs. The centre of gravity,before sustained by the wings, must now bebrought over the new basis of support formedby the feet; or rather, as it is placed farforwards, the feet must be considerably advancedso as to be brought underneath thatcentre. But as the bones of the posterior extremityhave their origin from the remote partof the pelvis, which is elongated backwards, ata considerable distance from the wings, it becamenecessary to lengthen some of their parts,and to bend their joints at very acute angles.We accordingly find that while nature, in theformation of the limb, has preserved an accordancewith the vertebrated type, both as to thenumber of pieces which compose it, and as totheir relative situations, she has deviated fromthe model of quadrupeds in giving much greaterlength to the division corresponding to the foot.At the same time that the foot is brought forwards,the toes are lengthened, and made tospread out so as to enclose a wide base, overwhich the centre of gravity is situated. TheFEET OF BIRDS. 585extent of this base is so considerable that a birdcan, in general, support itself with ease upon asingle foot, without danger of being overset bythe unavoidable vacillations of its body.The femur is short compared with the tibia,which is generally large, especially in the orderof Grallct, or wading birds : the fibula is exceedinglyslender and always united, at itslower part, with the tibia ; and there is a totaldeficiency of tarsal bones, except in the Ostrich,where rudiments of them may be traced . A alreadywe have seen, in ruminant quadrupeds, thatthese bones have dwindled to a very small size :but here they have wholly disappeared. Thelong bone which succeeds to the tibia, thoughconsidered by some anatomists as the tarsus,is properly the metatarsal bone, and in theGrasse is of great length. At its lower end ithas three articulations, shaped like pullies, forthe attachment of the three toes : there is besides,in almost all birds, a small rudiment of anothermetatarsal bone, on which is situated the fourthtoe. The number of bones which compose eachrespective toe appears to be regulated by a uniformlaw. The innermost toe, which may be comparedto a thumb, consists invariably of twobones : that which is next to it in the orderof sequence has always three ; that which followshas four ; and the outermost toe has five bones :the claws in every case being affixed to the last586 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.joints, which have therefore been termed theungual bones. This remarkable numeral relationamong the several bones of the toes existsquite independently of their length.There is one whole order of birds which areparticularly fitted for climbing and perchingupon trees, having the two middle toes parallel toeach other, and the inner and outer toes turnedback, so as to be opposed to them in their action.They are thus enabled to grasp objects with thegreatest facility ; having, in fact, two thumbs,which are opposable to the two fingers. Theyhave been termed Scansores, or ZygodactylyAlmost all other birds have three toes before,and one behind.From this enumeration it would appear as ifNature, in modifying the type of vertebratedanimals to suit the purposes required in the bird,had purposely omitted one of the toes, which areusually five in number. But instances occur ofbirds, in which we may trace the rudiment of afifth toe high upon the metatarsus, and upon itsinner side. The spur of the cock may be regardedas having this origin. What confirmsthis view of the subject, is, that in those birdswhich have only three toes, namely, in the Emu,the Cassowary, and the Rhea, it is again theinner toe which disappears, leaving only thethree outer toes, namely, those which have respectivelythree, four, and five phalanges. TheFFvET OF BIRDS. 587Ostrich has only two toes, one having four, andthe other five phalanges ; here, again, it is theinnermost of the three former, that is, the onehaving three phalanges, which has been suppressed.*A bird is capable of shifting the position ofthe centre of gravity of its body, according ascircumstances require it, simply by advancing ordrawing back its head. While flying, the neckis stretched forwards to the utmost, in order tobring the centre of gravity immediately underthe origin of the wings, by which the body isthen suspended. When birds stand upon theirfeet, they carry the head back as far as possible;so as to balance the body on the base of support.When preparing to sleep, they bring the centreof gravity still lower, by turning the head roundand placing it under the wing. These motionsof the head are again resorted to when the birdwalks ; and the centre of gravity is thus transferredalternately from one foot to the other :hence, in walking, the head of a bird is in constantmotion ; whilst the duck and other birds,whose legs are very short, have a waddlinggait. It may be observed that the more perfectlypredaceous birds are not the best formedThe last bone of the outer toe of the ostrich is very small,and being usually lost in preparing the skeleton, has been overlookedby naturalists ; but Dr. Grant has ascertained, by thecareful dissection of a recent specimen, the existence of thisfifth phalanx.588 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.for walking ; because, were they to use their feetfor that purpose, their talons, which are requiredto be kept sharp for seizing and tearing theirprey, would be blunted; and accordingly theeagle, when moving along the ground, supportsitself partly by the motion of its wings.In roosting, birds support themselves upontheir perch by means of one leg only, the otherbeing folded close to the body. They evenmaintain this attitude with greater ease and securitythan if they rested upon both feet. Thetrue explanation of this curious fact was longago given by Corelli. On tracing the tendons(t, t Fig. 233) of the muscles (m, m) which bendthe claws, and enable them to grasp an object,we find them passing over the outer angles ofeach of the intervening joints, so that wheneverthese joints are bent, as shown in Fig. 234, thosetendons are put upon the stretch, and mechanically,or without any action of the muscles, tendto close the foot. When the bird is on its perch,this effect is produced by the mere weight of thebody, which, of course, tends to bend all thejoints of the limb on which it rests ; so that thegreater that weight, the greater is the force withwhich the toes grasp the perch. All this takesplace without muscular effort or volition on thepart of the bird. It remains in this position withmore security on one foot than it would havedone by resting upon both ; because in the latterROOSTING OF BIRDS. 589case, the weight of the body, being dividedbetween them, does not stretch the tendons sufficiently.In this position the bird not onlysleeps in perfect security, but resists the impulseof the wind and the shaking of the bough.The great length of the toes of birds enablesthem to stand steadily on one leg : and in thisattitude many employ the other foot as a hand ;especially parrots, whose head is too heavy to bereadily brought to the ground. Some birds,which frequent the banks of rivers, are in thepractice of holding a stone in one foot, whilethey rest upon the other : this contributes toincrease their stability in two ways ; first, itadds to the weight of the body, which is theforce that stretches the tendons, and causesthem to grasp the bough ; and, secondly, it alsolowers the centre of gravity.590 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.The stork, and some other birds belonging tothe same order, which sleep standing on onefoot, have a curious mechanical contrivance forlocking the joint of the tarsus, and preservingthe leg in a state of extension without anymuscular effort. The mechanism is such as towithstand the effect of the ordinary oscillationsof the body, when the bird is reposing ; but it iseasily unlocked by a voluntary muscular exertion,when the limb is to be bent for progression.On these occasions the ball of the metatarsalbone is driven with some force into the socket ofthe tibia.*I must content myself with this general viewof the mechanism of birds ; as it would exceedthe limits within which I must confine myself,to enter more fully into the peculiarities whichdistinguish the different orders and families.Some of the more remarkable deviations fromwhat may be considered as the standard conformation,may, however, for a moment arrest ourattention.The Ostrich is of all birds the one that presentsthe greatest number of exceptions to thegeneral rules which appear to regulate theThis mechanism is noticed by Dr. Macartney in the Transactionsof the Royal Irish Academy, vol. xiii, p. 20, ansi is morefully described in Trees's Encyclopaedia, Art. Bird. He observesthat both Cuvier and Demerit have committed an error in referringthis peculiarity of structure to the knee instead of thetarsal joint.STRUCTURE OF THE OSTRICH. 591conformation of birds, and in many of its peculiaritiesof structure it makes some approachto that which characterises the quadruped.Though this bird is provided with wings, it wasevidently never intended that they should beused for the purposes of flight. Hence thechief muscular power has been bestowed on thelegs, which are remarkably thick and strong,and well fitted for rapid progression. The sternumis flat and does not present the keel-likeprojection which is so remarkable in that ofall other birds. The clavicles do not reach thesternum, nor even meet at the anterior part ofthe chest to form the circular bone : for as thewings are not employed in flying, the usualoffice of that bone is not wanted. The form ofthe pelvis is different from the ordinary structure; for the pubic bones, which in all otherbirds are separated by an interval, here unite asthey do in quadrupeds.The feathers are unprovided with that elaborateapparatus of crotchets and fibres, which areuniversally met with in birds that fly. Thefilaments of the ostrich's feathers, in consequenceof having none of these fibrils, hang loose anddetached from one another, forming the fine hairor down, which, however ornamental as anarticle of dress, must be viewed, when consideredphysiologically, as a species of degeneracyin the structure of feathers.592 THE MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS.The Penguin, in like manner, has a wing,which is, by its shortness, totally unfitted forraising the body in the air : it has, indeed, receiveda very different destination, being formedfor swimming. In external form it resemblesthe anterior extremity of the turtle ; but still wefind it constructed on the model of the wings ofbirds ; as if nature had bound herself by a lawnot to depart from the standard of organization,although the purpose of the structure is altogetherchanged. As penguins are intended foramaritime life, all their extremities are formedfor swimming. Their legs are exceedinglyshort, and placed far backwards so that thesebirds are compelled, when resting on their feeton the shore, to raise their bodies in a perpendicularattitude in order to place the centre ofgravity immediately above the base of support :a posture which gives them a strange and grotesqueappearance.I have already alluded to the lengthened legsand feet of the waders, the utility of which tobirds frequenting marshy places, and shallowwaters, is very obvious. Their legs are notcovered with feathers, which would have beeninjured by continual exposure to wet. Butbirds of a truly aquatic nature, have their toeswebbed, that is, united by a membrane, a mechanismwhich qualifies them to act as oars, andindeed gives them a great advantage over allMUSCULAR POWER IN BIRDS. 593artificial oars that have been constructed byhuman ingenuity ; for as soon as the expandedfoot has impelled the water behind it, the toescollapse, and while it is drawn forward it presentsa very small surface to the opposing water.Their plumage is so constructed as to preventthe water from penetrating through it, and forthe purpose of preserving it in this conditionthese birds are provided with an oily fluid,which they carefully spread over the wholesurface of their bodies. The Swan, and manyother water-fowls, employ their wings as sails,and are carried forwards on the water with considerablevelocity, by the impulse of the wind.Birds excel all other vertebrated animals inthe energy of their muscular powers. Thepromptitude, the force, and the activity theydisplay in all their movements, and the unweariedvigour with which they persevere forhours and days in the violent exertions requiredfor flight, far exceed those of any quadruped,and implies a higher degree of irritability, dependentprobably on the great extent of theirrespiratory functions, than is possessed by anyother class of animals.END OF VOL.
