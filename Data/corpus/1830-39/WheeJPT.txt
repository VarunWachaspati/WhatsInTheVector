Judge Hitchcock of Alabama.New York, 13th March, 1837.ALLAN POLLOCK, JR. ESQ.g IR : I have given a cursory perusal (all that my time would allow,) to thework, entitled " A Practical Treatise on the Law of Slavery," upon which youhave requested my opinion.As an abstract of the decisions to be found in the American Reports, upon thatsubject, arranged under convenient heads, I have no doubt it will be a valuablework for the use of the members, particularly of the Southern Bar of the UnitedStates. Respectfully, your obit. serve. H. HITCHCOCK.Prom the New York Mercantile Advertiser.Slavery. The proof sheets of a new work on this subject, which will be publishednext week by Mr. Pollock, 92 Fulton street, have been submitted to us. Itis a compilation of all the decisions made on that subject in the several Courts ofthe United States, and State Courts, with copious notes and references to thestatutes and other authorities, systematically arranged, 1 vol. 500 pages svo.From a recommendation of the Hon. Judge Hitchcock, of Alabama, we have nodoubt of its accuracy and usefulness, especially to the southern bar ; and at thisparticular time, a work of considerable interest at the north, ft is rarely we takeup a book that is its equal in point of printing and paper, and it reflects great crediton Messrs. Craighead and Allen, who are the printers. It will stand a comparisonwith the best London publications, and we should be glad to see all otherpublishers pursue the same course in getting up their works that Mr. Pollock has.done.From the New York Star.Work on Slavery. A most important work is nearly ready for publication,and will be issued next week by Mr. Pollock, 92 Fulton street. It is a compilationof all the decisions made on the subject of slavery by the several Courts ofthe United States and State Courts, with copious notes, indexes, &c. &c, by J. D 9Wheeler, Esq. and very elegantly printed by Craighead & Allen. At this crisiswe should say such a work is of great interest and value, and should have a greatcirculation in the Southern States, as well as those States in which the question isagitating.ALLAN POLLOCK, JR.LAW PUBLISHER, 92 FULTON STREET, NEW YORK.Can furnish the following work, by the single copy, or wholesale viz :A PRACTICAL ABRIDGEMENT of AMERICAN COMMON LAWCASES, argued and determined in the Courts of the several stales, and the UnitedStates Courts, from the earliest period to the present time ; alphabetically arranged; with Notes and References to the Statutes of each State, and analagousAdjudications Comprising under the several titles, a Practical Treatise on thedifferent branches of the Common Law. By J. D. WHEELER, Esq. Counsellorat Law. 8 vols. royal octavo price $6 per vol. in calf extra.Among the letters received commendatory of this Abridgement, are the followingfrom Chancellor Kent and Chief Justice Marshall.SIR : I have curiously looked over the first volume of Wheeler s PracticalAbridgement of Common Law Cases 1 which you were so obliging as to send me.As far as I have had time to examine the work, I have found it ably and accuratelyexecuted. The rapid multiplication of American Reports, suggests the necessityand value of such an undertaking, and when it shall be completed, in the mannerand style it has commenced, it will, and ought to become, an indispensable part ofa Lawyer s Library. I wish the Editor and publishers of the Abridgement, theutmost patronage and success. Your s respectfully, JAMES KENT.From Chief Justice Marshall, dated Richmond. April 16, 1834.SIR : I received your letter of the 21st March, accompanying the first volumeof Wheeler s Practical Abridgement of American Common Law Cases, which Ihave read rapidly. The plan is well adapted to the object of the writer, which iscertainly a valuable one, to furnish the profession with some information respectingthe decisions and peculiar statutory provisions of the different States which composeour great Republic. Reports have multiplied so enormously, that they canbe collected only in public libraries, or in those of the wealthy and curious :this interesting communication, therefore, can be communicated only by means ofAbridgements, or Treatises, such as Story s Conflict of Laws. The plan on whichMr. Wheeler has executed his abridgement, appears to me judicious; he has presentedwith the necessary brevity, the very point decided in the words of theCourt. To speak positively on the accuracy of the selections, would require an intimateknowledge with the Reports themselves, to which I have no pretensions ;but so far as I am acquainted with them, I am satisfied in his fidelity.Very respectfully, JOHN MARSHALL.A PRACTICAL and ELEMENTARY ABRIDGEMENT of the casesargued and determined in the Courts of King s Bench, Common Pleas, Exchequer,and at Nisi Prius, from the restoration in 1660, to Michaelmas Term, IV Geo. 4,with important manuscript cases, alphabetically and chronologically arrangedand translated, with copious notes and references to the year books, analagous adjudications,text writers and statutes, specifying what decisions have been affirmed,recognised, qualified or overruled, comprising under several titles, a PracticalTreatise on the different branches of the Common Law, by CHARLESPetersburg, Esq. of the Middle Temple. 15 vols. royal octavo.A supplement to the above work being an abridgment of the cases decided inthe same Courts from 4th Geo.

M DONALD. June T. 1827. 4 M Cord s Rep. 223.THE action was brought against the defendant, as a common distinction*carrier, to recover the value of a near woman and her child, who b , etw . e ? ~.the liabilitywere passengers on board the defendant s boat from Charleston to of a carrierGeorge Town. The boat came to an anchor at night at one of an a a balethe inland creeks between those places, and at the ebb of the g o f~slaves betidethe boat filled, and the slave and her child were lost. The cap igtain used all necessary diligence, and had a pilot on board. The human be-judgecharged the jury, that there was no difference in the liability mgsof the defendant, as captain of a steam-boat, for the loss of theslaves, than for the loss of bales of goods. Verdict for plaintiff.Motion for a new trial.The Court. Johnson, J., held there must be a new trial ; thatthere was a distinction between the liability of the carrier in the transportationof a slave and a bale of goods ; that the slave was a humanbeing, and the carrier could not control the operations of hermind, or her physical action. She might will her own destruction,or she might escape. And his honor, after referring to the casesThe definition of a slave by the Civil Code of Louisiana is thus given: " A slaveis one who is in the power of a master to whom he belongs."

Slaves differfrom all other property : they have reason and volition. Where aslave is in the possession, or in the ordinary employment of a person,and another takes such slave away, it should not be matterof inquiry in this court whether the negro was willing to go ornot.3.Weldon S EX R v.

From the first settlement of the colony W h areof Virginia to the year 1778 Oct. less., all negroes, Moors, and mu - slaves -latter, except Turks and Moors in amity with Great Britain, broughtinto this country by sea or by land, were slaves, and by the uniformdeclaration of our laws, the descendants of females remain slaves tothis day, unless they can prove a right to freedom by actualemancipation, or by descent in maternal line from an emancipatedfemale. See the case ex parte Ferret, 1 Rep. Const. Court ofSouth Carolina, p. 194. where the court held, that an East Indian,though il a person of color," is not liable to be taxed under the ordinanceof the city council of Charleston, imposing a duty oneach free negro, or person of color, whether a descendant of anegro or otherwise."7.Huggins v. WEIGHS. Nov. 1806. 1 Hen. & Munf. 134.Held by the court, Green J., that to solve all doubts, the act of The rule1662 was passed, which declared, that all children born in this P ar , tus se ~,,,,,, ,, ,. quitiir veutshall be bond or free, according to the condition of the them ob-mother.It is the rule of the civil law. By that law the civil stateof the child was determined by that of the mother at the time ofthe birth.This rule of the Civil Law prevails in all the states, and in many of them statuteshave been enacted upon the subject. See act of 1740, South Carolina, 2Brevard s Dig. 229. And in Georgia, by the act of 1770, Prince s Dig. 446. And bythe Rev. Code of Mississippi, 369. Rev. Code of Virginia, vol. 1. p. 421. CivilCode of Louisiana, art. 183. And the same rule, that slaves follow the condition ofthe mother, obtains in the West Indies. Edward s West Indies, book 4. ch. 1. Thisrule was broken in upon in Maryland by an act passed in the year 1663, ch. 30,which establishes the common law doctrine, parties sequitur patron. See the cases ofButler v. Craig, 2 Harris & M Hen. 214. and Butler v. Boardman, 1 Har. &M Hen. 371. The law was, however, changed by the act of 1715, which restored themaxim of the civil law, partus sequitur ventre.4 SLAVERY.8.STATE v. DAVIS AND HANNA, Dec. T. 1831. 2 Bailey s Rep. 558.Definition The defendants were indicted under the bastardy act, and onterence the mother s being called as a witness, it was objected that she waslatto. a mulatto ; but the jury found them white women. The defendantswere convicted, and moved to set aside the verdict, on theground of misdirection in the charge of the court.The court observed that the term mulatto, as used in thisstate, was vague, and signified, in general, a person of mixed whiteand negro blood, in whatever proportions it might be mingled.The various distinctions which have obtained in the French andSpanish American colonies has not been adopted in this state.Harper J., in delivering the opinion of the court, observed, thatit seemed to be an error in the judge s charge to the jury, instating,that " a mulatto was the offspring of parents, one of whomwas white, and the other black," and that he " was disposed tothink, that where the white blood predominated, the disqualificationought not to attach." According to this instruction, weunderstand, that the child of a quadroon and a mulatto, accordingto the distinction in Louisiana, must be accounted white. Yet, Isuppose, that even in Louisiana such a person would be called amulatto. It is certainly true, as laid down by the presiding judge,that " every admixture of African blood with the European, orwhite, is not to be referred to the degraded class." It would be dangerousand cruel to subject to this disqualification a person bearingall the features of a white, on account of some remote admixture ofnegro blood ; nor has the term mulatto, or person of color, I believe,been popularly attributed to such person. The shades are infinite,and it is difficult to fix a limit. I do not know that we can laydown any other rule than to give what appears to be the popularmeaning of the word : to wit, that where there is a distinct andvisible admixture of negro blood, the person is to be denominateda mulatto, or person of color. It is a question for the jury. Indetermining it, they may have the evidence of inspection as tocolor, and the peculiar negro features ; the evidence of reputation,as to parentage ; and such evidence as was offered in the presentcase, of the person having been received in society, and exercisedthe privilege of a white man.DEFINITION AND NATURE OF. 59.THE STATE v.

And if a mulatto beconvicted in a court of sessions, the judge may, on inspection, refuseto pass sentence, and turn over the prisoner to a court ofmagistrates and freeholders.10.MARIA ET AL. v.

Beyond this there is no degradation color, not being distinguishablefrom white persons, either by color or feature. Edwards West Indies, book4. ch. 1. Stephens Slavery of the West India Colonies Delineated, p. 27.This is the general doctrine in all the states, and the application of a differentrule is only in cases where the person is a mulatto, or some other grade approximatingto a white person. See post, title " Evidence," in actions for freedom6 SLAVERY,slavery arising from color, as being sufficient evidence of title inhim, to put the plaintiff on proof of his freedom. And of thisopinion was the court, and the plaintiff excepted.Per Cur. Boyle, Ch. J. The question admits of but little doubt.Color and long possession are such presumptive evidences ofslavery, as to throw the burden of proof on the party claiming hisfreedom.12.BRANDON ET. AL.V.

It apergodless 6 feared by the testimony of witnesses, that they were standingproperty. near t ne engine house at the public square in Huntsville, whenthe negro boy was cutting wood near, and heard him exclaim hehad found money, and saw the boy raising the bundle. Theboy delivered the bundle to Brown, one of the witnesses, whotook it to the bank. The plaintiff demanded the money of thebank, which was refused, and this action was commenced. Thedefendants demurred to the declaration of the plaintiffs.The court held, that the action would lie ; and that the possessionof the slave, by finding, is the possession of the master, and ifit be taken from the slave by any person other than the trueowner, the master may receive it.Per Cur. Scaffold, J. Our slaves can do nothing in their ownright ; can hold no property ; can neither buy, sell, barter, or disposeof any thing, without express permission from the master oroverseer ; so that every thing that they can possess or do is, inlegal contemplation, on the authority of the master.Per Crenshaw, J. A slave is in absolute bondage ; he has nocivil right, and can hold no property, except at the will and pleasureof his master ; and his master is his guardian and protector ;and all his rights and acquisitions and services are in the hands ofhis master. A slave is a rational being, endowed with volition andunderstanding like the rest of mankind, and whatever he lawfullyacquires, and gains possession of, by finding, or otherwise, is theacquirement and possession of the master. A slave cannot takeDEFINITION AND NATURE OF. 7property by descent or purchase.* And see HALL v. MULLEN,5 Har. & Johns. 190.

" Slaves are incapable of inheriting or transmitting property."Art 945.

In the year 1562, SirJohn Hawkins was engaged in transporting and selling slaves in the West Indies ;and in the years 1585 and 1588, charters were granted by Queen Elizabeth, encouragingthe trade. In 1620, a Dutch vessel carried slaves from Africa to Virginia, beingthe first importation in the English colonies. And in 1672, the African company wasestablished in Great Britian. It appears by the records of the Dutch New Netherlands,that slaves existed in their settlements as early as 1620.

It was first commenced by a number of Quakers,in 1727, who liberated their slaves, both in England and the colonies of North America.In 1751, the Quakers made a formal abolition of it among themselves. In 1783, thefirst petition was presented to parliament for the abolition of the trade. See a statementof the proceedings in the Edinburgh Encyclopedias. The subject came again before thehouse of commons, in 1788, being brought forward by Mr. Pitt, but without success,In 1792, the house of commons passed a bill for the abolition of the slave trade inORIGIN AND HISTORY OF.of Indians. No legislative act of the colonies can be found in relationto it. The first introduction of slaves in the British colonieswas accidental. In the year 1616, as stated by Robertson in hishistory, and in 1620, as stated by Judge Marshall in his Life ofWashington, a Dutch ship, from the coast of Guinea, sold a partof her cargo of negroes to the planters on James River. Thiswas the origin of the slavery of the blacks in the British colonies,and it is thought that Indians, at this 1 time, were held in slavery.DAVIS (a man of color) v. CURRY. Fall T. 1810. 2 Bibb sRep. 238.In an action for freedom, Davis proved that, in the year 1789, he Slaveswas brought as a slave into the then district, now state of Kentucky, duce infrom the state of Delaware, where he had been held as a slave. * e , co i"Hies Dy tncThere being no proof of any law of that state which authorized motherslavery, he moved the court to instruct the jury, that the evidence,on the part of the defendant, was not sufficient to support his title.The court refused the instructions, and he excepted.Per Cur.

And in 1796, Wilberforce brought inabill, providing that the slave trade should be abolished forever, after the 1st March,1797. See the debates in parliament of that year. In June, 1806, on motion of Mr.Fox, a bill passed, declaring the slave trade inconsistent with justice, humanity, andsound policy ; and the act finally abolishing it, passed Feb. 5, 1807. The act, making itfelony to be engaged in the slave trade, passed the British parliament, May 4, 1811,which was followed by the act, declaring the slave trade piracy, in 1824.The first act to prohibit the slave trade was passed in the year 1794. The act declaredit illegal to fit out any vessel for the purpose of carrying on the trade. This wasfollowed by the act of 1800, declaring it unlawful for any citizen to have any propertyin any vessel employed in the transportation of slaves from one country to another.And by an act, passed in 1807, it was declared, that after the 1st of January, 1808,it should not be lawful to bring into the United States, or the territories thereof, fromany foreign place, any negro, mulatto, or person of color, with intent to hold or sellhim as a slave. In 1820, it was declared, that, if any citizen of the United States,belonging to the company of any foreign vessel, engaged in the slave trade, or anyperson whatever belonging to the company of any vessel, owned, in whole or in part,by, or navigated for, any citizen of the United States, should land on any foreignshore, to seize any negro or mulatto, not held to service by the laws of either of thestates or territories of the United States, with intent to make him a slave, or shoulddecoy, or forcibly carry off such negro, or mulatto, or receive him on board any suchvessel, with the intent aforesaid, he should be adjudged a pirate, and on conviction,suffer death.tO SLAVERY.the courts in all the colonies were equally bound to fake notice, inthe same manner as the courts of the several states are now boundto take notice of any regulation of the general government; andwhat the courts of the colonies were bound to take notice, judicially,we must still be presumed to know, if not as matter of law, at leastas matter of history. We must, therefore, presume that slavery istolerated in Delaware, inasmuch as that was the case before the revolution.The presumption of slavery, which attaches to the plaintiff,is not destroyed by proof of his removal from that state.HALL v.

Johnson, J., It has been contended, on the part of theappellant, that the condition of slaves in this state is regulated bythe civil law; and that as by that law slaves could purchase propertyonly for the sole use and benefit of their masters, that, therefore,the bill of sale of Dolly to Basil, the right to Dolly passed out ofHall, and became immediately vested in the then owners of Basil,who were the general representatives of Benjamin Hall. On the partof the appellee it is urged, that the slaves in this state are similarto villeins in England, when villeinage existed in that country ; andthat, as in that country, when a villein purchased property, it didnot pass immediately by or through him to his lord, but remainedin the villein until the lord entered on, or took possession of theproperty; any disposition made of such property, before the entrywas made, or possession taken, was valid.

Loft.WHO MAY BE HELD IN SLAVERY. 11As it appears by the civil law, the property never abides forone instant in the slave, if the rights of Dolly Mullin, as derivedfrom her father Basil, depend upon that law ; as Basil was incapableto manumit, no claim on her part can rest on a deed of his execution.But should her rights rest on the feudal law, applicable tovilleinage, then, as Basil never was disturbed in the possession ofDolly by any of the representatives of Benjamin Hall, or any otherperson, before or after the deed of manumission was executed, thatdeed would be competent to set her free, and, of course, rendersher capable to take the land devised. But the condition and rightsof slaves in this state depend exclusively, neither on the civil orfeudal law, but may, perhaps, rest in part on both, subject, nevertheless,to such changes in their condition and capacity to contractas the laws of this state prescribe, and as contained in variousacts of our state legislature. By the act of 1715. ch. 44. 11.,it was prohibited " to trade, barter, commerce, or any way deal withany slave," without the leave of the master. The contract betweenHenry L.

A summary of suchWHO MAY BE HELD IN SLAVERY. 13of them as are necessary to arrive at proper legal conclusions, maybelaid down as follows : In the year 1765 or 1766, Duchess, anIndian trader, brought an Indian woman to Opelousas, whom hesold to Chretien, the father of the defendant, and appellee. Shedied not long after, leaving a female child, who remained peaceablywith Chretien, as his slave, until some time during the periodin which the Baron de Carondelet was governor of the provinceof Louisiana, when she went to New Orleans with her master, forthe purpose of claiming her freedom before the proper tribunal.It appears from a certificate of Peter Pedesclaux, a notary, thata suit was commenced, but no record remains, or can be found, ofthe manner in which it terminated. She returned with Chretien,and remained with him as his slave until his death, which happenedafter the United States took possession of the country under thetreaty made with the French government in the year 1803. Shewas called Agnes, and brought forth several children while held in astate of slavery by Chretien, of whom the plaintiff, and appellant,is heir. After the death of the ancestor of the defendant, and thedistribution of his estate, Agnes and some of her children, all descendedfrom the Indian woman sold by Duchess, as abovestated, brought suit in the parish court of St. Landry against theirowners, among whom was the present defendant, to recover theirfreedom. From a judgment by default, which afterwards becamefinal, an appeal was taken to the superior court of the late territoryof Orleans, where the cause was tried by a jury, and a verdictrendered in favor of the then plaintiff, and appellee, whichwas set aside by the court, on account of some misconduct in thejury, and a new trial ordered. The case remained in this situationuntil the change in the country, from a territorial to a state government,and was then transferred with others to the fifth districtunder the new system. As the person who became judge of thatdistrict had been engaged as counsel in the cause, it was transferredfor trial to the second district, and the then appellee, who was theoriginal plaintiff, not appearing to prosecute his suit, was declared bythe court to be non-suited, and judgment was accordingly entered.It appears from the depositions of a number of witnesses, (admittedby the parties to have been correctly taken, and to be properevidence in the cause,) that at the time the Spanish governmenttook possession of the country, viz. in 1769, under the secret treatyof cession made between France and Spain in 1763, many ofthe inhabitants of the colony, which had been established and settSLAVERY.tied under the authority of the French government, held and possessedIndians as slaves, and it seems to have been a belief prettygeneral among them that the practice of holding Indians in slaverywas tolerated and authorized by that government. The fact thata considerable number of Indians and their descendants were heldin slavery at the period alluded to, is clearly proven. These beingall the important facts in the rase, we will proceed to examinethe plaintiff s, and appellant s, claim to freedom, on the ground takenby his counsel. It is grounded on a judgment of the parish courtof St. Landry, as being res judicata, by a competent tribunal. Butif it be determined that it be not conclusively supported and establishedby the judgment, it is contended that the plaintiff, andappellant, is free by birth, being the lineal descendant of an Indianwoman. His counsel contends, that the decision of the causemust be according to the rules of the Spanish system of laws.According to these laws it is clear, that since the famous regulationsof Charles V., made about the middle of the fifteenth century,Indians could not be reduced to slavery ; and if the case was to bedecided by them, he would certainly be entitled to his freedom.But on the other side, it is contended, that this court ought to begoverned in the determination of this suit by the municipal lawsand usages of France, by which her American colonies wereruled. On this previous question our opinion is in favor of thedefendant, and appellee. It is true that the province of Louisianawas ceded by France to Spain, in 1763, by a secret treaty, but noeffectual possession of the country was taken until the arrival ofgovernor O Reilly in 1769. Now, it is an incontrovertible principleof the law of nations, that in cases of the cession of anypart of the dominions of one sovereign power to another, the inhabitantsof the part ceded retain their ancient municipal regulations,until they are abrogated by some act of their new sovereign.In relation to the colony of Louisiana, nothing tending to repeal itsformer laws, such as they were under the French government, tookplace till the year 1769, and we have already seen that the Indianwoman, the ancestor of the plaintiff, was brought into the countryand sold as a slave in the year 1765 or 1766.Slavery, notwithstanding all that may have been said and writtenagainst it, as being unjust, arbitrary, and contrary to the lawsof human nature, we find in history, to have existed from the earliestages of the world down to the present day. In investigating therights of the parties now before the court, it is deemed unneces-WHO MAY BE HELD IN SLAVERY. 15say lo inquire into the different means by which one part of thehuman race have, in all ages, become the bondsmen of the other,such as captivity being the offspring of those already enslaved, &c.However, we are of opinion, that it may be laid down as a legalaxiom, that in all governments in which the municipal regulationsare not absolutely opposed to slavery, persons already reduced tothat state may be held in it; and we also assume it, as a first principle, tha slavery has been permitted and tolerated in all the coloniesestablished in America by European powers, most clearlyas relates to the blacks and Africans, and also in relation to Indiansin the first periods of conquest and colonization. Takingthis principle for granted, it accounts, in some measure, for the absenceof any legislative act of European powers for the introductionof slavery into their American dominions. If the record ofany such act exists we have not been able to find any trace of it.It is true that Charles the Fifth, in the first part of the sixteenthcentury, granted a patent to one of his Flemish favorites, for theexclusive right of importing four thousand negroes into America,which was purchased by some Genoese merchants, who were thefirst who brought into a regular form the commerce for slaves betweenAfrica arid America. A few years before a small numberof negroes had been introduced by the permission of Ferdinand,But the privilege granted by the emperor, so far from being thefirst introduction of slavery into the new world, was intended as ameans of enabling the planters to dispense with the slavery of theIndians, who had been reduced to a state of bondage by their Europeanconquerors. A full account of these transactions may beseen in Robertson s History of America. On turning our attentionto the first settlement of the British colonies in America, wefind that the introduction of negro slaves into one of the most important,was accidental. In the year 1616, as stated by Robertson,and 1620, by Judge Marshall, in his life of Washington, aDutch ship from the coast of Guinea sold a part of her cargoof negroes to the planters on James river. This is the first originof the slavery of the blacks in the British American provinces.About twenty years after, slaves were introduced into New England.All this took place without any previous legislative act on thesubject; and it is believed that Indians were at the same time, andbefore, held in bondage. The absence of any act, or instrumentof government, under which their slavery originated, is not a matterof greater surprise than that there should be none found SLAVERY.thriving the slavery of the blacks. The first act of the legislatureof the province of Virginia on the subject of the slavery ofthe Indians, was passed in 1670, and one of its provisions, as weareinformed by Judge Tucker, prohibits free or manumitted Indiansfrom purchasing Christian servants. The words free or manumittedare useless and absurd, if there did not exist Indians inslavery, and Indians who had been slaves, and had been manumittedbefore and at the time this act was passed. Indeed, from thehistory and legislative proceedings of the British colonies, both inthe West India islands and in North America, it clearly appears,that in most, if not in all of them, the slavery of the Indians wastolerated by government in the early period of their settlement,without any specific legislation on that subject. The French governmentwas later in establishing colonies in America than theBritish and Spanish. In our researches on the subject under consideration,we have not been able to discover any legislative act ofit, by which the colonies were authorized to hold Indians in bondage,but that it was customary to purchase and hold some classesof them in slavery, cannot be doubted. This cannot have beenwithout the permission, or at least the toleration of government.Moreau de St. Mery, speaking of the black population of St.Domingo, observes, that among it are the descendants of some Indiansfrom Guiana, Louisiana, &c., whom government and individuals,in violation of the law of nature, deemed it profitable to reduceto slavery. 1 Hist. St. Dom. 67. In the beginning of theeighteenth century, he adds, there were upwards of three hundredIndian slaves, in the French part of St. Domingo. In 1730, thegovernor of Louisiana sent three hundred of the Natchez tribe tobe sold. Several arrived after that period from Canada andLouisiana. Here we have historical facts establishing, beyond contradiction,the holding of Indians as slaves, in one of the Frenchcolonies, many of whom were transported from the very colonyin which the ancestor of the plaintiff, and appellant, were held inbondage. Were it necessary to prove that they were legally heldso, the evidence of it would be found in their being taxed as slaves,(2 St. Domingo Laws, 541 .,) a circumstance which creates, at least,a very violent presumption that the municipal regulations of theFrench colonies did not prohibit the slavery of lee Indians.This appears to have been the opinion of the Spanish government,which we have seen succeeded to the French in Louisiana.Governor O Reilly, in 1769, on taking possession of the colony,WHO MAY BE HELD IN SLAVERY. 17discovered that a considerable number of Indians were held inslavery by the French colonists. This he declared, by a proclamation,to be contrary to the wise and pious laws of Spain : butby the same instrument, he confirmed the inhabitants in the possessionof such Indian slaves, until the pleasure of the king, inthis respect, could be known. Here is then a recognition of theright of the possessors, to hold their Indians slaves, until the legislativewill of the monarch should deprive them of it. This neverdid happen. In conformity with this opinion, is a decree of theBaron de Carondelet, twenty-five years after, in 1794, by which heorders two Indians, Alexis and David, to return to, and abide withtheir owners, until the royal will was expressed to the contrary.The inhabitants of the colony of Louisiana, while under the governmentand dominion of France, held Indians in slavery. TheSpanish government, under which they passed, recognized theirright to hold them, until it should be altered by a declaration of theking s will. It never was declared. The colony, without anychange in the condition of the original population, is receded tothe French nation, and by it transferred to the United Stales, undera treaty securing to its inhabitants their rights to property, as theystood under the former government. Throughout these politicalchanges, the ancestor of the defendant, and appellee, remained undisturbedin his possession of the plaintiff, and appellant s mother,as his slave, and of him since his birth. It is true that, during thegovernment of the Baron de Carondelet, the plaintiff s mother, ashas been stated, made an attempt to obtain her freedom. Whatproceedings took place before that governor, whether any, or whatjudgment was rendered, cannot now be ascertained. The onlything clear is, that she returned with the defendant s father fromNew-Orleans, and remained with him as his slave until his death.This certainly raises a presumption, that the suit terminated in amanner unfavorable to her claim. If this is to have any weighton the determination of the present case, it must certainly be placedagainst the plaintiff. Upon the whole, we are of opinion, thatneither from a view of political changes in the country, nor a fairexamination of the subject, is the plaintiff, and appellant, entitledto his freedom.18 SLAVERY.2.ULZIRE ET AL. v.

The cause was submittedto a jury, on special facts, who have found that the petitionersare descended from an Indian woman of the Chickasaw tribe;and that the defendant has shown no title to hold them as slaves.On this verdict, the duty of the court is very simple : if the defendanthold the plaintiffs in slavery without any title, he does so illegally,and they must be set free.

And the defendant movedthe court to instruct the jury that a native American Indian, heldin Jamaica as a slave, under the laws of that island, and importedinto Virginia by her proprietor in the year 1746, or 1747, mightlawfully be held as a slave in Virginia, notwithstanding such personwas a native American Indian.

HILL ET AL., 2 Hen. & Munf. 149.The court held, that Indians had always been considered as No nativefree persons, in fact and in right. In the year 1679, the Virginia could havelegislature passed an act, declaring Indian prisoners taken inwar to be slaves ; and in the year 1682, another act was passed, Ydeclaring that Indians sold to us by neighboring Indians, andothers trading with us, should be slaves. But in the year1691 these acts were repealed, and no Indian could be made aslave under the laws of Virginia since the latter period. And theGeneral Court, in April T. 1777, decided that all American Indiansbrought into this country since the year 1705, and theirdescendants in the maternal line, are free. See JENKINS v.

It was contended, that as the mother and daughterwere confessedly Indians, it furnished prima facie evidence, at least,that they were free. On the other hand, it was contended, thatthe acts of the legislature of New Jersey, recognised Indians asslaves. March 11, 1713 14. Allison, p. 18.

The habeas corpus in this caseseems to have been sued out under the supposition that an Indiancould not be a slave under our laws. But this idea is contradictedby various acts of assembly, some of which have been cited on theargument ; and, indeed, it cannot be urged with any show of reason.They have been so long recognised as slaves in our law, that itwould be as great a violation of the rights of property to establisha contrary doctrine at the present day, as it would in the case ofAfricans ; and as useless to investigate the manner in which theyoriginally lost their freedom.WHO MAY BE HELD IN SLAVERY. 21C. ) OF WHITE PERSONS.1.BUTLER v.

It is said, that the distinguishing characteristicsof the different species of the human race are so visiblymarked, that those species may be readily discriminated from eachother by inspection, and that in the case of a person visibly appearingto be of a slave race, it is incumbent on him to make outhis freedom ; but in the case of a person visibly appearing to beof a free race, it is required of his adversary to show he is aslave. Applying the doctrine to the case, I have no doubt thejudgment of the district court was correct upon the verdict ofthe jury ; putting out of the case every thing in the verdict,except the finding of the jury, that from inspection, the said plaintiff,Nanny Pageee, is a white woman ; and this is quite sufficient, itbeing incumbent on the defendant to have proved, if he could, thatthe plaintiff was descended in the maternal Fine from a slave.Having not proved it, she and her children must be consideredas free.OF THE INCREASE OF SLAVES. 23(IV.)

Inspeaking of the above case, Mr. Dulany says, that the barof Maryland have considered the case as settling the law, thatpurchases have been made, and much property is held underthe decision. And that the two principal reasons which governedthe court were, 1st. That the issue ought to go to theperson to whom the use was limited ; otherwise, having no interestworth regarding, he might not take care of the issue, andthat it would only be a reasonable satisfaction for the expenses ofmaintenance. 2d< That when the use is given, a bounty at allevents is intended ; but instead of a benefit, if the issue should goover, there might be a loss** And in Cohen v.

According to the principles of law, a person hiring ananimal is entitled to the increase, because, for hiring for a time hebecomes temporary proprietor for the time of the animal. Andthe doctrine becomes stronger where the hiring is for life.The children of Cloe were born during the life time of Maria,and while she was entitled to her services. They, therefore,belonged to her ; and in case of her decease, to her legal representatives; and if there be no such representatives, which isprobably the case in this instance, the children being the issue ofher own daughter, they, of course, have become free. The plaintiffbeing one of those children, if not entitled to his freedom altogether,at all events, cannot be claimed by the defendant in thiscase.(B.) OF THE GRANT OR DEVISE OF THE INCREASE.1.PULLER S EXR S v. PULLER. December T. 1824. 3 Rand. Rep. 83.This was a bill by Mrs. Puller against the executors of herhusband, enjoining them not to sell two slaves, Garret and Icy, The wordwhich they had advertised. inT iiiThe testator, Puller, on the 4th of March, 1818, made his will, thou j. d f-nprctlly DQand devised as follows : (l I give to my beloved wife, Ann Puller, restricted500 acres of land, including my present dwelling, and a negrowoman named Jenny, and her increase," c. Jenny had twochildren, Garret and Icy ; the youngest of whom was 14 years of includeage at the date of the will. Jenny was near 40 years of age at the born be-dateof the will, and had borne no children for the last 14 years,which was known to the testator. And the question was, whetherthese children passed under the will to Mrs. Puller ; or, in otherwords, whether the term increase in a will conveyed the past aswell as the future children. The Chancellor decreed in favor ofMrs. Puller, and the defendant appealed.The court (Coalter, Cabell, and the President, delivering opinions)held, that the wordjncrease ought to be construed to apply to thefuture offspring, if the expression be not enlarged by the contextof the will, or other admissible evidence. See Reno v. Davis,4 Hen. & Munf. 283.Per Belly J., after observing the decree must be affirmed,said, there is not only no case fixing the import of the term increase,but it is most certain that when taken abstractedly, it is variouslyunderstood even among judges. Chancellor Wythe and JudgeFleming gave it an enlarged, and Judge Tucker and the Judge28 SLAVERY.who preceded me, gave it a restricted interpretation. I am alsoinclined to believe, that it is generally used in the restricted sense,so as to embrace future increase only ; and although it is quitecommon to and expressly the term future, yet that is done out ofabundant caution to remove all doubt upon the subject.2.BANKS ADM R v. MARKSBURY. Spring T. 1823. 3 Little sRep. 275.The owner The administrator of Rachel Banks sued Marksbury in defence,of a female . , ,slave may W recover sundry slaves.fne e of r h The P plaintiff claimed title under a deed of gift of Samuelchildren, Marksbury, which was in these words : " For and in considerationture in of love and good will I bear to my children, I give and grant to myanother. t0 son > Samuel Marksbury, my negro wench Pen ; and her increasefrom this time I do give to my daughter Rachel Marksbury."Rachel intermarried with William Banks, and the wench hadseveral children, now held by the defendant. The court instructedthe jury, that the plaintiff had no right to recover.Per Cur. It is contended, that no interest in the slave in questionpassed by the deed, being her future increase which was given, andthe donor had nothing in him to give at the time ; and that a mancannot make a good grant, or gift, unless the thing be in him atthe time of the grant, according to the maxim nemo dot quod nonhabet. Without controverting the correctness of this maxim, or ofthe principle on which it is founded, we have no hesitation in saying,that it is inapplicable to the present case. He who is the absoluteowner of a thing, owns all its faculties for profits or increase; and he may, no doubt, grant the profits or increaseas well as the thing itself. Thus, it is every day s practice togrant the future rents or profits of real estate ; and it is held, thata man may grant the wool of a flock of sheep for years. Noy sMax. 83. The interest which the donor s daughter Rachel tookin the increase of Pen must, indeed, from its nature, have beencontingent at the time of the gift ; but as the children of Pen werethereafter born, they would, by the operation of the deed, vest inthe donee.3.RENO S EX RS v.

Before the date of the will, ^^ BSib had two children, and after the death of the testator had ed b y , a [ !parts 01 theanother ; and the question was, whether the claimant was entitled will takento all the children, or only to the one born after the testator sdeath plain , ed b ?parol testiclecourt held, that the word increase, (without the word future mony,prefixed,) in the bequest of a female slave, was ambiguous, andmust be explained by the whole will taken together ; and if themeaning of the testator cannot be discovered, then parol testimonymay be admitted. See Courts v. Craig, 2 Hen. & Munf. 622. ;Fleming v. Willes, 2 Call s Rep. 5.Per Fleming, J. The word increase may well be construed toinclude the children of Sib, born as well before as after the dateof the will, and ought to be construed most favorably to the legatees,and to have the same import as if, instead of the word increase,he had used the word offspring. And I am rather inclined to believe,that all the children of Sib were intended to pass by the bequest,as the word increase precedes the name of the mother ; andif the testator had intended that none should pass but those thereafterborn, he probably would have bequeathed Sib and her futureincrease, which would have removed all doubt upon the subject.4.Marli v. Martin. August T. 1832. 3 Yerger s TennesseeRep. 546.On the 20th May, 1813, W. Lucas, of Orange county, Vir The wordsginia, made and published his last will and testament. Among crease ^numerous bequests in the will, is the following : " I lend to my the bequestJ of femaledaughter, Rachel Marli, three negroes, now in her possession, slaves, ex-hannah,Harry, and Major, during her natural life, and after her embracedecease, I give unto all the children of Sarah Marlin. deceased, such in ~crease asthe negroes above named, to be equally divided among them, with are bornall their future increase, to them, their heirs, &c. forever." By bequestthe same will he gave to his daughter Rachel Marlin, his negro not & bygirl Winney, then in her possession, with all her future increase. construedeight or nine bequests of specified slaves in this will, is the same tended toconclusion to each, " with their future increase."Per Cur. Peck, J. The question raised by the pleadings and creaseproof is, whether the offspring of the slaves named, born before30 SLAVERY.the will, passed by the words in the bequest. It appears the slavesin controversy were born prior to making the will. The caseof Rind s Ex r v. Davis and Wife, 4 Hen. Munf. 283., is, wethink, decisive of the construction to be put upon this will. Therethe question was, whether the term increase carried with it thenegroes previously born ; but the court agreed in that case, thatthe terms " future increase," in the will would have put the casebeyond doubt, and would have included only the after-born slaves.The word future, (so often repeated,) must be taken as havingbeen intentionally and understandingly used by the testator whenhe was making his will. The estate claimed by the plaintiff was aremainder. Now, what remainder, it may be asked, after the deathof Mrs. Marlin 1 To ascertain this, we are conducted to the propertyloaned for life, Hannah, Harry, and Major. These aregiven by name, and by number, " my three negroes ;" and theconclusion of the clause, " the negroes above stated," negativesthe presumption that others than those named were intended topass in remainder. The testator must be taken as knowing hisproperty at the time he is making these bequests. The children ofHannah in being, when he gave those named, are not of the lifeestate ; and how shall they be, by any construction, made part ofthe remainder over 1 We find a bequest in the will of " Nan and allher children." If it was intended that the children of Hannah, withthe exception of Winney, should pass, why not use the like wordsas those used in the bequest of Nan ? The will is carefully drawn,and the repetition of the words, " future increase," added to thefact that previously born children were bequeathed in some instances,is not only persuasive, but conclusive, to show that it wasnot the intention of the testator to give prior increase with " Hannah,Harry, and Major," given by name. The death of these duringthe life estate may produce inequality in the distribution ; but wearenot to forget that the property is perishable ; that it could happento others of the devisees as well as to complainants. No foresightcould guard against the contingency, or anticipate with certaintythe length of Mrs. Marlin s life. Be these things as theymay, we follow the obvious import of the words used, and accordwith the construction given to like words, relating to like property,by all judges in a sister state. The decree must be reversed, andthe bill dismissed.OF THE INCREASE OF SLAVES. 315.FULTON v. SHAW. January T. 1827. 4 Rand. Rep. 597. ;SHELTON v. BARBOUR, 2 Wash. Rep. 64. ; PEGRAM v.ISABEL, 2 Hen & Munf. 193. ; MARIA v. SURBAUGH, 2Rand. Rep. 228.Fanny Shaw brought an action to recover her freedom against Where aElizabeth B. Fulton. It appears that in 1788, John Fitzgerald,by a deed of emancipation, in pursuant to the act of 1782, relinquishedhis right to Mary Shaw, and declared her free ; "reserving a reservesabsolute right or claim to all such child or children which the t h e futuresaid Mary Shaw may hereafter bring, or may have born of herbody." And the question was, whether Fanny Shaw, the child of slaves, the- reservationMary, was free, or a slave. is void.Per Cur. Carr, J. Upon the execution of this deed, MaryShaw became, to all intents and purposes, free, unless this effect wasprevented by the subsequent reservation of an absolute right toany children she might afterwards have. It is clear, that it was notthe intention of the grantor, by this subsequent clause, to modifyor narrow the freedom before given. The clause relates solely tofuture increase. The deed bestows present freedom on MaryShaw. The reservation had no present effect. It could onlyoperate on a future contingency. Mary might never have children.In that case, the reservation would be a nullity, Wouldsuch a clause suspend, or in any way affect the freedom givenimmediately, and without qualification, by the former part of thedeed ? Unquestionably not.We must give the instrument its true meaning, and that is exceedinglyplain. The grantor meant to emancipate Mary Shaw, fullyand immediately, and to hold in slavery any children she mightafterwards have ; and the only question is, not a question of intention,but of power. Could the grantor, by giving the mother perfectfreedom, reserve to himself any interest in her future children?When a female slave is given to one, and her future increase toanother, such a disposition is valid, because it is permitted to a manto exercise control over the increase and issues of his propertywithin certain limits. But when she is made free, her condition iswholly changed. She becomes a new creature ; receives a newexistence ; all property in her is utterly extinguished ; her rightsand condition are just the same as if she had been born free. Afterthus detesting himself of all property in the mother, the grantor32 SLAVERY.could not reserve to himself a right to hold her future progeny inslavery. A free mother cannot have children who are slaves.Such a birth would be monstrous, both in the eye of reason andthe law. The reservation was therefore repugnant to the grant.^ V 6.HAMILTON v.

There being no limitationover on the death of Sarah Turner, and the words, " the abovenamed negroes," were intended to be used as words of description,not to be restricted to those who were before mentioned by name,but must be understood as applying to all who were the subject ofthe bequest, the issue as well as their mothers. They were allplaced in the same state and condition during the life of SarahTurner, and no difference in their condition after her death wasintended, but were all of them the objects of the benevolence ofthe testatrix.7.MARIA v.

The mother of Fanny, and her increase,was to be free the 1st of January, 1816. Fanny, wasborn since 1798, and before 1816. The circuit court instructedthe jury, that Fanny is a slave, and they found for defendant.Per Cur. Robertson, Ch. J. The maxim partus sequitur ventre,does not apply to this case. If the grantor had been silentas to the " increase," and no intention to liberate the childrencould be inferred from the deed, then Fanny would be undeniablya slave, because her mother was a slave when she was born. Insuch a case, the issue would be born a slave, and, "partus sequiturventrem," would fix her doom. But the grantor had the powerto secure Fanny before her birth, all the benefits of freedom, andthus liberate her from hereditary slavery. Although it is a generalmaxim, that no one can give what he has not, nevertheless, the34 SLAVERY.owner of a thing 1 , being entitled to all its capacities, may grantthem to another : thus, the owner of a flock of sheep may grantthe wool which shall grow on them. The owner of real estate,corporeal or incorporeal, may grant its future profits. The ownerof a female slave may grant her future increase. In all suchcases the grantor has a potential right to the thing granted, becausehe has the perfect right to the thing, of which it is the naturaloffspring, or to which it is incident.As, therefore, the grantor could have granted to another a validlegal title to Fanny, by deed dated before she was born, he had anequal right to grant her to herself, or to grant to her liberty*Whether the grant would take effect, was contingent. It dependedon her birth. The instant when she was born the grant operated,and it became certain and effectual on the first day ofJanuary, 1816. A deed of emancipation, liberating a female slaveand "her increase," on a given day, futuro, emancipates all herissue born after the date of the deed. Judgment reversed.10.BARRINGTON v.

Those, then, inslavery were continued so. Children born afterwards, who, butfor the act, would have been slaves, became apprentices, with allthe liabilities and immunities of apprentices, bound to serve thoseto whom as slaves they would have belonged, until they attained28 years of age. And the court proceed : " We cannot doubt,then, that Dinah Barrington was born free, and never was a slave ;OF THE INCREASE OF SLAVES. 35and as she was never a slave, her children must be free. Hadthey been born in Pennsylvania the would certainly have beenborn free. The fact, that they were born in Kentucky cannotprejudice their natural and legal rights, for partus sequitur ventremis the law of this state ; and we know of no law, human or divine,which stamps slavery, a facilitate, on children whose mother wasa free woman at the time of their birth. The only legal effectresulting from the fact that the appellants were born in this state,is, that their birthrights must be determined by the lex loci. Theirmother having been a free woman at the time of their respectivebirths, they, like all other children of free mothers, were by thelaw of the place of their birth born free absolutely, at once, andforever.11.M CuTCHEN et. al. v. MARSHALL et. al. January T. 1331.8 Peters Rep. 220. HOPE v. JOHNSON, supra.The testator, M Cutchen, devised to his wife, Hannah, all his Childrenslaves, provided that at her death they should be set free, and for a qua-everbe liberated from slavery, with the exception of those who lisle . d . manJ missionwere not of age at the death of his wife, who were to remain oftheirmo-under the control of the testator s brother and brother-in-law until born 3they became of age, when they were to be set free. Rose, one slavesof the female slaves, and her children, were to be set free on thedeath of his wife, absolutely and entirely. Eliza and Cynthia,two other slaves, had children born after the death of the testator,and before the death of his wife. Nothing was said in the will asto the children of Eliza and Cynthia. After the death of the wife,the heirs of the testator claimed all the slaves and their increase, tobe distributed among the next of kin of the testator. They allegedin their bill, that by the laws of Tennessee, slaves cannot besetfree by last will and testament. That if the law does notauthorize emancipation, that they are still slaves until the periodof emancipation ; and that the increase born after the death ofthe testator, and before their mothers were actually set free, wereslaves, and as such liable to be distributed. And the bill chargedthat Marshall, the defendant, being the legal representative, refusedto distribute the said slaves and their increase among the nextof kin. Marshall demurred to the bill, and the circuit court sustainedthe Demurrer, and ordered the bill to be dismissed ; andthe complainants appealed to this court.3G SLAVERY.Per Cur. Thompson, J. The laws of Tennessee authorize theemancipation of slaves in the manner provided for in the will of thetestator. It is an admitted rule in the state of Tennessee, that theissue of a female slave follows the condition of the mother. If,therefore, Eliza and Cynthia were slaves when the children wereborn, it will follow as a matter of course that their children wereslaves also. If this was an open question, it might be urged withsome force that the condition of Eliza and Cynthia, during the lifeof the widow, was not that of absolute slavery, but was by the willconverted into a modified servitude, to end upon the death of thewidow, or on their arrival at the age of 21 years, should she diebefore that time, If the mothers were not absolute slaves, butheld in the condition just mentioned, it would seem to follow, thattheir children would stand in the same condition, and be entitledto their freedom on their arrival at the age of 21 years. But thecourse of decisions in the state of Tennessee, and some otherstates where slavery is tolerated, goes strongly, if not conclusively,to establish the principle, that females thus situated are slaves ;that it is only a conditional manumission, and until the contingencyhappens upon which the freedom is to take effect, they remain,to all intents and purposes, absolute slaves; and the courtdo not mean to disturb the principle. The children of Eliza andCynthia must, therefore, be considered as slaves.(V.) OF SLAVES CONSIDERED AS PROPERTY.(A.) WHEN CONSIDERED AS REAL PROPERTY.: Iftfj Vf/:i " i ^ ! vtjM Dwell S ADM X v.

One of the reasons was, that the bond recites an at perty.attachment against the personal estate, when the attachment producedis against the goods, chattels, and slaves.Per Cur. The reason assigned by the circuit court must bepredicated on the supposition, that between the recital in the bondof an attachment against personal estate, and the attachment as itissued being against slaves, as well as goods and chattels, there wasan essential variance. But slaves are, in their nature, as much personalestate as goods and chattels, and are expressly made liableto an attachment. It is true, that by the positive law of thiscountry, slaves are declared to be real estate; but by the same law,there are to that rule so many exceptions, that they may, at leastin common parlance, and by common intent, be sufficiently describedas personal estate.

CRAIG AND WIFE, Dec. T. 1827. 6 Monroes Rep. 254.The bus Detinue for slaves. It appeared that Mrs. Craig, the wife of the- defendant, was the widow of Singleton, and at his death becametas Sl \vife f entitled to the slaves mentioned in the declaration as her dower inon his death his estate j that she afterwards married John Hawkins, who, forpass to his , 111representing years held possession of the slaves, claiming them as the dowerof his wife in the estate of Singleton. And after Hawkins died,the slaves were held by his wife until she married Craig, the defendant.Administration was granted on the estate of Hawkins to theappellants, who claimed the slaves as having vested in Hawkins,but he refused to deliver them up, on the ground that theslaves survived to his wife on the death of Hawkins, and that theadministrator had no right to them.Per Cur. Owsley, J. If the right which the husband acquiresin the dower of slaves of the wife, be of the same sort as thatwhich he is entitled to in her dower lands, we would readily admit,that after the death of the husband it would survive to the wife,and not pass to the representatives of the husband. But slaves arefor most purposes considered as chattels. There is one sectionof the act which goes explicitly to place the right of the husbandto the interest of the slaves of his wife on the footing of chattels,and is taken from the acts of the Virginia legislature. The courtsof that state have decided that husbands are entitled to the interestof slaves, whether belonging to their wives at the time of themarriage, or accruing to them during coverture, upon the footingof chattels. Wallace and Wife v. Taliaferro and Wife, 2 Call. 447. ;Pinkardv. Smith and Wife, Little s Sel. Cas. 331. ; Banks v. Marks-berry,Little s Rep. 275. In neither of the cases to which we havereferred did the question arise as to what right the husband acquiredin the dower slaves of his wife, but they all involved the questionof right in the husband to the slaves of his wife, and they allrecognise the principle, that since the passage of the act of SLAVES CONSIDERED AS PROPERTY. 39ginia, from which the act of this country was copied, the husbandis entitled to the same right to slaves owned by his wife at the timeof marriage, or which accrue to her during coverture, that he wouldbe entitled to, were they to every purpose chattels only, so thatwhether the wife has an estate in fee simple in a slave, or but anestate for life only, and whether she came to the estate by her ownact, or by operation of the law, the principle is the same, and theright, be it greater or less, vests as chattels in the husband, if reducedto his possession during coverture. It follows, therefore,that if the slaves in contest belonged to Mrs. Craig, whilst she wasthe wife of Hawkins, and they were reduced by him to possession,though in right of his wife s dower, only the entire right of his wifevested in him, and at his death that right passed to the appellants,as his administrators.2.CHINN AND WIFE v.

JJ^Y a f^But it does not follow that the testator, by the devise of his personal vise of pers0113*1 GS*estate, did not intend that his slaves should pass ; for although tate.slaves were by law made real estate, for the purpose of descentand dower, and perhaps some others, yet they had in law many ofthe attributes of personal estate. They would pass by a nuncupativewill, and lands would not ; they were liable to be sold for thepayment of debts, and lands were not ; they could be limited in agrant or devise no otherwise than personal chattels ; and personalactions might be brought to recover the possession of them. Besides,they were in their nature personal estate, being moveableproperty, and such as might attend the person of the proprietorwherever he went ; and in practice they were so considered andtreated by the people in general. When, therefore, a man devisedhis personal estate, he must be understood to intend that his slavesshould pass thereby, unless he used some expressions indicating adifferent intention.3.ENLAWS v.

In this case the judge below, among otherthings, told the jury that " the act of 1784 is not repealed by theact of 1801, so that there is still a necessity for a bill of sale."Although the act of 1784 is not repealed, nevertheless, the succeedingsentence of the charge is too broad. A deed registered is onlynecessary where possession does not accompany the gift or sale.It has been constantly held, that where possession is delivered at thetime a gift or sale of a slave is made, it is good as between the parties,and vests a title without a deed. 2 Hay.

If there had been a sale accompaniedwith a delivery, the property in the slave passed, notwithstandingthe act of 1821, although there was no bill of sale. Andthat lending, or even giving the money, by Johnson s wife, would44 SLAVERY.not invalidate an actual sale, accompanied by a delivery. Thecounsel for the defendant moved the judge to instruct the jury,that if they thought the ten dollars was not in fact lent, or given,by Johnson to Mariana, and that he did not mean to give her creditfor the amount, but furnished them to her, and received them hack,mere tolerably, and to make a gift under the pretence and formof a sale, that the property did not pass. The judge declinedgiving such instructions, and the jury returned a verdict for plaintiff,whereupon the defendant appealed.Per Cur. Hall, J. With respect to the act of 1821, concerningthe sale of slaves, accompanied with a delivery, the inclinationof my mind is with the judge below. I also agree with him thatthe receipt is inoperative, as a bill of sale, if for no other reason,because it has no subscribing witness to it. Rev. ch. 225. For thesame reason it cannot be supported as a deed of gift. Rev. ch.701. The question then is, was there a sale and delivery of thenegro in dispute.The receipt is evidence that ten dollars was paid, but the circumstancesattending the payment are before us. From them itappears that there was, in fact, no payment made by the plaintiff.The money was in reality paid by Johnson to himself, so that,although the jury found a delivery, the payment did not amount tosuch consideration as to make it a sale of the slave. If, then,there was a delivery, but upon no consideration, it was a gift ; butthat, by the act of 1806, Rev. ch. 701., is void, because not authenticatedby deed. A sale, completed by delivery, requires nosuch evidence. Disguise this case as you will, it is only a gift.If it is considered as a sale, the act of 1806 may be evaded bythe consideration of a pepper corn. Judgment reversed.4.PALMER v. Fauces. Dec. T. 1829. 2 Devereaux s NorthCarolina Rep. 240.The 7th Detinue for a slave. After the plaintiff had made out his case,section of , , r ,the act of the defendant proved, that upon his marriage with a daughter ofthe Plaintiff, in the year 1821, the slave in question had been putntO *" s P possession bv the plaintiff ; that this possession continued,gifts of until the year 1825, when the plaintiff received the slave again,and tired nim for a P art of the vea rs 1825 and 1826. After whichthe Slave Was again P permitted to SO into the possession of the de-andregis fendant. There was proof that the plaintiff sent to the defendantOF TITLE TO SLAVES. 45a writing respecting the negro, but whether it was a letter or a bill tered, wasof sale, the witness did not know. There was also proof of the the protectorsof this instrument, and it never had been registered. The JjSora anddefendant relied upon his possession for three years under theact of 1820, Rev. ch. 1055., as a variation of his title, supposing it der it, ato be defective. His honor instructed the jury, that as the act of faieiTgood1S06 avoided all gifts of slaves unless in writing, signed by the Jj^ we ^donor, and attested by a witness, so, a possession of a slave for without athree years, held under a gift not evidenced, as that act required, P erie attestnot confer a title under the act of 1820; that every pos %y depressionof property must either be consistent with, or in opposition thus attestthe title. Where the possession is acquired with the consent out its bookthe owner, it constituted the contract of bailment. Where theparties intended to convey the titles, but made use of a mode inoperativeand void, the ownership remained unchanged, and thepossession being still taken by the consent of the owners, formsa bailment; and that supposing such contract to have beenconstituted when the negro was first received by the defendant,it must have been ended, and three years possession have occurredsince its dissolution, to enable the defendant to acquire a valid titleunder the act of 1820. A verdict was returned for the plaintiff,and the defendant appealed.Per Cur. Hall, J. The act of 1784, Rev. ch. 225. sec. 7.,from its preamble and the adjudications upon it, was passed principallyfor the protection of creditors and purchasers. The preambleis as follows : " Whereas many persons have been injuredby secret deeds of gift to children and others, and for want of formalbills of sale for slaves, and a law for perpetuating such giftsand sales." It then provides for the registration of such deeds,and that they shall be attested by one credible witness at least.The construction put upon the act, that it was made for the benefitof creditors and purchasers, is evident from the cases of Knightv. Thomas, 1 Hay. Rep. 289.; Cutler v. Spiller, 2 Hay. Rep. 61.;Lynch v. Ashe, 1 Hawks Rep. 338. ; Rhodes v. Holmes, 2Hawks Rep. 193. ; Bateman v. Bateman, 1 Car. Law Repos. 85.Consistently with this construction of the act, the act of 1792,Rev. ch. 363., declares, that all sales of slaves bona fide made, andaccompanied with actual delivery, shall be good without any bill ofsale. According to the cases before cited, it was not necessary,as between the parties, that there should be a bill of sale ; or ifthere was one, that it should be attested by a subscribing witness ;or if so attested, that it should be registered. Judgment affirmed.46 SLAVERY.5.PEABODY et al. v. CARROL. Feb. T. 1821. 9 Martin s LouisianaRep. 295.When the Per Cur. Mathews, J. In this suit, which was originated byattachment, two slaves have been seized as the property of the deanf cant > and are claimed by A. Haynes, as belonging to him. Inreal, ffctiti- support of his claim, he offers in evidence a bill of sale from theventioimi n defendant, the fairness and genuineness of which seems not to behfir^ till dis P used - But il; does not appear that the sale was attended withliable to be a delivery of the property.attached .fortheven- l here is a provision in our statute relating to the tradition ordor s debt delivery of slaves, which states, that it may take place, either byactual delivery made to the buyer, or by the mere consent of theparties, when the sale mentions that the thing has been sold anddelivered. Civ. Code, 350. art. 28. The bill of sale produced bythe claimant contains no clause expressive of such consent of theparties as prescribed by the law cited. It is in evidence, that theslaves were not, at the time of executing the sale, in the actualpossession of the vendor ; but were on board of a keel-boat thendescending the Mississippi, according to the testimony of Green,a witness examined in the cause ; and according to the bill of sale,they were hired on board of the steamboat Gen. Jackson. Ifthis sale is to be considered as a contract entered into and completedin the state of Tennessee, which is by no means clear, wehave no evidence before us of the lex loci, and must, consequently,decide the case in conformity with the laws of the state where theproperty is found, and the suit commenced. In doing this, thereis little difficulty, if we adhere to former decisions in similar cases,by which it has been established, that before actual delivery of thething sold, it may be attached by the creditors of the vendor.Durnford v. Brooke s Syndics, 3 Martin s Rep. 222. Mumfordv. Norris, 4 ib. 25. As there has been no delivery of the slaves,either real, fictitious, or conventional, we are of opinion, that thedistrict court is erroneous in denying them to the claimant.6.PALMER v. Fauces. Dec. T. 1829. 2 Devereaux s NorthCarolina Rep. 240.The act of Detinue for a slave. After the plaintiff had made out his case,ch. 701,) the defendant proved, that upon his marriage with a daughter of thegifts d of g plaintiff, in the year 182 1, the slave in question had been put into hisOF TITLE TO SLAVES. 47possession by the plaintiff; that this possession continued until the slaves unii i less in. w ri-year1825, when the plaintiff received the slave again, and hired ting, attest-himout for a part of the years 1825 and 1826. After which theslave was again permitted to go into the possession of the defendant.There was proof that the plaintiff sent to the defendant a tered, is aiMi / statute ofwriting respecting the negro, hut whether it was a letter or a bill ot fraudssale, the witness did not know. There was also proof of the loss e d p rot f ^of this instrument, and it never had been registered. His honor, tion of do-thejudge, charged the jury, that the plaintiff having shown a title under it ain himself, that it was incumbent on the defendanttoshow thatit wasdetested : and as the latter claimed under a gift, since the act of against thedonor, ,he ought to satisfy them that the gift was in writing, signed less dulyby the donor, and attested by a witness subscribing it ; and fur !Jnd regis,ther, that in law a circumstance not made to appear was taken as terednot existing. A verdict was returned for the plaintiff, and thedefendant appealed.Per Cur. Hall, J. The act of 1806, Rev. ch. 701., " declaringwhat gifts of slaves shall be valid," was made, as it emphaticallydeclares, " for the prevention of frauds," and may be fitlycalled a statute of frauds. It declares, that no gift of slaves hereafterto be made, shall be good or available in law or in equity,unless the same be made in writing, signed by the donor, attested byat least one subscribing witness, and shall be proved or acknowledgedas conveyances of land, and registered within one year. Thisact was made, not only for the benefit of creditors and purchasers,but also for that of donors. It must be well remembered what a fruitfulsource of litigation parol gifts, and pretended parol gifts, werebefore the passage of this act ; and that, too, in many cases wherecreditors and purchasers were not concerned. To remedy thatmischief the law was passed for the benefit of donors. And inproportion as any of the requisites of the acts are dispensed with,so in proportion will the mischief be left without remedy. Ii thepresent case, between the donor and donee, if there had been adeed of gift, and that deed had been registered, although the deedwere lost, there would be no difficulty in procuring a copy of it.If deeds of gift have been bonafide executed, injury is done to noone by registering them. Mischief may be done by concealingthem until after the death of the donors. But the act is positive,that such deeds shall be registered as conveyances of land. Thisclears the question of doubt; because nothing passes by conveysSLAVERY.dances of land, or shall be good and available in law, unless thesame shall be acknowledged, or proved, and registered.I arn, therefore, of opinion, after full reflection, that the instructtions given by the judge to the jury, on the trial in the court below,were correct. It is true, that what I said in Justice v. Cobs, 1 Dev.Rep. 469., on the question of adverse possession, was extra judicial.The question involved in the decision of that case did notrequire it. That was the case of a possession where there was noparol gift proved. But it is a warning lesson not to speculate onsupposed cases. Judgment affirmed.7.THOMAS v. Sober. Feb. T. 1816. 5 Munf.

To this opinion of the court a billof exceptions was filed, and a verdict being found, and judgmentrendered for the plaintiff, the defendant appealed to this court,which affirmed the judgment. And see Thomas v. Sober, 5Munf. Rep. 58. ; where the court say, that, although in case ofan absolute deed of slaves where the grantor remains in possessionafter the execution of the deed, it is fraudulent and void as tosubsequent purchasers and creditors ; yet the same is obligatory,and cannot be impeached, as between the grantor and granteeand their representatives.OF TITLE TO SLAVES. 498.Pagan v.

Ml of sale,The sheriff sold the negro, as the property of Harrison, to Kenneth the interthe defendant, and this action of detinue was brought against SSaona.him to recover the slave.The court held, that a bill of sale of slaves made by a personindebted, who retains possession after the execution of the bill ofsale, is void against creditors, although a valuable consideration mayhave been received. The court say, in conveyances of personalproperty the law supposes a transfer of possession. In subjectsof this nature, two views present themselves: one as between theparties themselves, and those claiming directly under them ; theother, as it respects such individuals as may stand in a relation tobe affected by the transaction. In the first, delivery of possessionmay not be necessary; in the latter, it is usually otherwise.9.MADRY v. YOUNG. Oct. T. 1831. 3 Louisiana Rep. 160.This was a suit instituted by Mary to recover of the defendant where theanegro slave named Jack. It appeared the defendant was once f e r " de ^ uf "the owner of Jack, but exchanged him, in the state of Mississippi, vendor toretain pos-withone Dawson for a slave named Aaron. Dawson being unable session,to make a complete title to Aaron, Young refused to make an ab !Jnd deussolute title to Jack. Dawson executed an instrument which was " th g e oldrecorded in Mississippi, where the transaction took place, in which to a secondhe reconveys Jack to Young ; but this conveyance, to be defensible latterble, if he, Dawson, made Young a good title to Aaron, Dawson jjftjj*remaining in possession of Jack, sells him to one Hunter, who to the first,sold him to Mary; each sale being accompanied with delivery.Young now claims Jack, and alleges Dawson had noauthority to sell him.Per Cur. Martin, J. Nothing is clearer than that, if the vendeesuffers the vendor to retain possession, and he sells and deliversthe thing sold to the second vendee, the latter will hold it inpreference to the first. In the sale of a slave in a state where theproperty passes by verbal sale and delivery, if the vendee suffers50 SLAVERY.the vendor to retain possession, and he sells and delivers the thingsold to a second vendee, the latter will hold it in preference tothe first. And where the sale is accompanied with delivery andpayment of the price, it transfers all the vendor s right and interest.10.Brandon v. GAINES et al. Oct.

March T. 1833. 4 Yerger s TennesseeRep. 168.A deed of ^ n ^ s was an ac ^ on f detinue, commenced in the circuit court ofgift for Giles county, by the defendant in error, to recover from the plain-slavesisvoid as to a tiff m error a slave by the name of Mary. From the bill of excepttions the Blowing facts appear : The father of the defendant inverb 9 P wo error execute d to him a deed of gift for the slave in controversy,witnesses, to which there were three subscribing witnesses. The deed wasproved within the time prescribed by law, by one of the subscribingwitnesses, and registered. At the time of its execution, defendantin error was a minor, living with his father. Some time in1827, the father of defendant in error sold the slave to the plaintiffin error, for a valuable consideration. Upon the trial of the cause,the defendant in error offered an office copy of the deed of gift inevidence. The production of the original was waived ; but thedeed was objected to, because it was only proved by one witness.The court overruled the objection; to which exception was taken,and the defendant in error, having a verdict and judgment, thedefendant below appealed in error to this court.Per Cur. Catron, Ch. J. The main question in this cause is,whether the deed of gift, by virtue of which plaintiff claims title tothe negro sued for, was properly admitted as evidence to the jury.OF TITLE TO SLAVES. 51It was made, in 1824, from the plaintiff s father to him, and purportsto have had three witnesses to it. At May term, 1824, itwas proved in the Sumner county court, by Edward Ellis, one ofthe subscribing witnesses, and certified for registration; and on thefirst of July, 1824, on this probate, registered. An office copywas offered, and objected to, because proved by one witness only,but received. Was the proof of one witness sufficient to authorizethe registration? The first act requiring two witnesses toinstruments required to be registered, is that of 1805, ch. 16. sec.2., which applies to the settlement of slaves, or other personalproperty, in consideration of marriage. The act of 1807, ch. 85.sec. 3., is, in this case, the governing provision. In the mode ofproof to authorize registration, there had been no difference incases of transfers of lands or slaves before 1807, and it is manifestthe act of that year did not intend to make any. As to lands, it isclear, two witnesses are required ; the deed is to be proven by atleast two subscribing witnesses, " and all bills of sale or other instrumentsof writing for the transfer of personal property, shall beso proven." The seventh section provides for the registration ofdeeds, theretofore made, on the proof of only one witness, because,until 1805, in no case had more than one been required.The proof by one witness did not authorize the registration of thedeed ; consequently, the copy offered in evidence was incompetentto go to the jury. Judgment reversed.12.PIERCE v. GRAYS et al. Feb. T. 1818. 5 Martin s LouisianaRep. 367.Per Cur. Mathews, J. The plaintiff, and appellant, claims two In Spain,slaves from the defendants. On the 17ihof August, 1809, he * m in-purchasedfrom Philip A. Gray, father of the defendants, eighteen g^s^de-slaves, and among them, the two now claimed, as having always livered to. . : the donee sremained in the possession of the vendor, or his heirs. On the father, isnext day he executed a deed of gift in favor of Mayo Gray, and Sarah ^6%^A. Gray, infant children of the vendor, for said slaves. The pro though heJ9 does notperty remained in this situation till the 17th of September, 1814, formallywhen the donor seems to have changed his benevolent intention g^ pttowards the donees, and declared, before the judge of the parishof Feliciancty his will and desire to revoke and annul " the deed ofgift executed by him in the year 1809, before Wm. Lewis, syndicof the district of Felicia, then under the government of Spain,"52 SLAVERY.The fact of the written donation executed by the plaintiff appearsso conclusively, by the introduction of the instrument intended asarevocation of the donation, that it is thought unnecessary to noticethe bill of exceptions of the defendants, on the introductionof parol evidence, to prove the acknowledgment of the plaintiffto that effect. The only question of law which arises out of thesefacts is, whether the donation was perfect and irrevocable, withoutany formal acceptance, for the infants by their father, or someother person.According to the rules laid down on the subject of donations,inter vivos, it is clear, that the donor is bound, only from the acceptanceof the donation, in precise terms, and that it producesno effect, except from the day of the acceptance. Civ. Code,220. art. 54. Were the case to be decided by these rules, it isprobable that the judgment of the district court would prove to beanerroneous one. But we are of opinion, that our code does notproperly exhibit the rules by which the point in dispute betweenthe parties must be settled. The contract was made under theSpanish government, and the municipal laws of Spain are aloneapplicable to it. These, it is believed, are not so rigorous as ourstatute in requiring a formal acceptance, in order to give validityto a donation, or to render it perfect and irrevocable ; except inthe cases laid down as ingratitude, a change of situation in the donor,who has given the greatest part of his estate, the subsequentbirth of children, &c., which apply to donations, complete as toform. Gomez, in his Vance, Resolutions, lays it down, on the subjectof donations, that they are executed in two modes : by delivery,or promise. By delivery, quando nulla precedents professionvcl obligation* quis trait suum rem alter causa donations ; quid tunestatim valet et pernicious donation ; et transit dominium ct plenum jusrei, in accipientem, ex titulo et causa donations. A donation bypromise is when a person obliges himself to give or deliver somethingto another. If a donation, accompanied by the delivery ofthe thing, be complete and perfect, it follows, as a necessary consequence,that it ought to be considered as irrevocable on the partof the donor, unless for causes authorized by law. The donationmade by the plaintiff, and appellant, was not accompanied by anyformal delivery of the slaves given to the appellees, or any personfor them ; but they were left in the possession of their father, whoheld them before the execution of the deed of gift to his infantchildren. He was the proper person to have received the TITLE TO SLAVES. 53tion for them ; and having already the possession of the slaves, noformal delivery was necessary to transfer the dominion of them infull right to the donees. We consider the slaves as having been inthe possession of the father, under the donation to his children,and held for them, from the time of the execution of the deed ofgift, to the commencement of this action. Was a formal, writtenacceptance of the donation necessary, on the part of the donees,under these circumstances, to render it irrevocable by the donor 1The court is of opinion, that it was not. It is very doubtfulwhether, by the laws of Spain, a formal acceptance be necessaryin any case where the delivery of the thing accompanies the donation.But in cases of minors, infants, and absent persons, no acceptanceis necessary to render the donation irrevocable, accordingto Gomez. (Treatise on Donations, p. 3.) It is true, that inadonation to an absent person, it seems required that the title ordeed be transferred to the donee, in order to render the donationirrevocable ; or that a clause be introduced, by which the notary,or officer before whom it is made, be requested by the donor to acceptit for the absent persons, and that he then takes it as if acceptedin due form. Ferro, 1. 5. n. 19. These regulationsare confined to absent persons ; and we find in the same books,(n. 30.) that a donor cannot revoke a donation made in such amanner so as to substitute a third person to the donee, when thesubstitute is an infant. From this view of the case, we are ofopinion, that the judgment of the district court is correct.13.GARRETT v. HUGHLETT. April T. 1800. 1 Har. and Johns.Rep. 3.The court held, that a bill of sale of negroes might be deemed A bill offraudulent from other circumstances than the continuance of pos froes maysession. The act of assembly, by requiring the bill of sale to be ac fasten?knowledged and recorded within a limited time, intended bv those fr . om othercircumof notoriety to take off the presumption of fraud ari stancessing from the vendor s continuing in possession. But if there were dor ^other circumstances attending the transaction, which tended continuing sin posses*to show it fraudulent, those circumstances might be given in sion -evidence.54 SLAVERY.14.PIERCE v. CURTIS et al. March T. 1819. 6 Martin s LouisianaRep. 413.sold, "re P er @ ur Mathews, J. In this case the plaintiff, and appellant,sues ^ or ^ e recovery ^ a slave, described in the petition. Thehe is liable action was commenced against Curtis alone, who, at the time, haded for 8 his possession of the slave. Gayles, the other defendant, intervened,and claimed the slave, in his answer, as his own, suggesting fraudin the transaction, by which the plaintiff obtained his title to theslave. Both Pierce and Gayles claim the slave under Curtis.The evidence on record shows the following facts : On the 21st.of October, 1813, Curtis, by a notarial act, sold the slave in questionto Abner Stanley, and retained a mortgage for his payment.It does not appear that the sale was attended with any tradition ;but Curtis held possession of the slave till August, 181 4, when Stanley,at his instance, conveyed to Pierce, by a notarial act, all thetitle which he acquired by the act of sale in 1813. After this,Curtis continued to possess the slave, as his own, until some time in1815, when the sheriff of East Baton Rouge sold him, under anexecution, upon and against the property of Curtis, and Curtispurchased him, at the sheriff s sale. On this statement of facts,the only question to be decided is, whether the slave sold, thus remainingwith the vendor, and never having been delivered to thevendee, was, or not, liable to be seized and sold to satisfy the debtof the former. The case of Durnford v. Brook s Syndics, 3 Martins Rep. 222. 259., is relied upon by the counsel of the defendant,and appellee, Gayles, and is certainly completely applicable to thepresent case, except that in the former the things sold were merchandise,which pass by a mere verbal agreement and delivery,whereas, the dispute is now about a slave, the title to whom hasbeen transferred by public and authentic acts. But we are of opinion,that this circumstance cannot operate against third persons,such as creditors, so as to defeat their just claims founded on principlesrecognized in the above case. There is not any evidencethat the slave was ever delivered to Pierce, or that the latter everexercised any act of ownership over him, except that which is derivedfrom an extra-judicial acknowledgement of Curtis, whose interestit is to countenance the forced sale by which he was to bebenefited. It is true that, according to our statute, the delivery ofa slave who is sold takes place when it is really made to the buyer,or by the mere consent of the parties ; when the sale mentions,OF TITLE TO SLAVES. 55that the slave has been sold and delivered to the buyer, or whenhe was already in possession under another title. Civ. Code, 350.art. 28. But this constructive delivery does not appear from theexpressions of the act of sale, and there is evidence that the slaveremained in the possession of the vendor.15.Dorset v. GASSAWAY. June T. 1809. 2 Har. & John s Rep. 402.Held by the court, Chase, Ch. J., that if slaves remain in posses And lesionof the vendor, the bill of sale must be recorded ; and whether Jove th r ethey remained in his possession is a matter of fact for the jury. If ains withJ J the vendorthey find they were not in his possession, the bill of sale is not or not, is arequired to be recorded, and is not evidence, although it was Set. 61recorded, unless the execution of it be proved.16.RICE v. HANCOCK. Nov. T. 1824. 1 Harper s Rep. 393.The defendant gave an absolute bill of sale of a slave, which The consisteda past consideration. The court held, he was not precluded fhT^eed^from showing that no consideration was in fact paid. ma . y b , e H 1 "quire in-perCur. Gantt, J. The consideration paid for the negro to -might, or might not, have been inserted in the bill of sale, and thetransfer in law would have been as effectual one way as the other.The insertion is more a matter of form than substance, and in noevent can preclude the party from inquiring into it. Had the defendantoffered evidence to show that the bill of sale was intendedto transfer a less interest than what was expressed therein, or thatanother negro than the one described was intended, &c. then suchevidence would be in contradiction to the deed, and not admissible.In transactions of this kind it is well known that the considerationexpressed in the instrument is not always paid down, butsecured by bond, note, or verbal promise, and it is the business ofthe purchaser to fortify himself with evidence of having paid theconsideration agreed to be given.17.MONDAY v.

The cause was submitted to a juryin the court below, who found a verdict for the defendant, andjudgment being rendered thereon, the plaintiff appealed.The evidence of the case shows that the slaves in question wereon a plantation, situated in the parish of St. Helena, belonging toMorgan, under whom both parties to this suit claim title ; one bya voluntary sale, the other by a forced sale, made under executionby the sheriff of the parish aforesaid. The sale to the plaintiffwas made to the plaintiff on the 18th of October, 1830. Thesheriff s sale took place in January, 1831, and was made underan execution which issued on a judgment confessed by Morgan infavor of the defendant Wilson. The validity of the sale is contestedon the ground of irregularities in the proceedings of thesheriff, he not having pursued the formalities required by law necessaryto give effect to forced alienation of property under ourjudicial proceedings. Whether the regularity of the course pursuedby the sheriff, in the sale by him made, could, under any circumstances,be inquired into in the collateral manner in which it ishere presented, need not be examined in the present case, as thecourt is of opinion that the plaintiff in the execution did not adoptthe means afforded him by law to render the property now in disputeliable to be seized and sold under his execution.The sale from Morgan to the plaintiff is by authentic act, madein due form, a fair price stipulated for the slaves sold, a mortgagereserved on them to secure payment, and the deed contains a declarationthat they have been delivered to the buyer.In addition to this clause of delivery, the record shows that thepurchaser had possession of them, as agent or manager of theplantation of the seller; and, as stated by the witness, W r william,had the management of these identical slaves in the fall of 1830.On the subject of tradition or delivery of the slaves, it is statedin article 2484 of the Louisiana Code, that it takes place inthree ways : " Either by real delivery made by the buyer, or bythe mere consent of the parties, when the sale mentions the thingsold has been delivered, or when the buyer was in possession underanother title." But the article 2456, provides, "that in all caseswhere the thing sold remains in possession of the seller, becauseOF TITLE TO SLAVES. 57he has reserved the usufruct, or retains possession by a precarioustitle, there is reason to presume that the sale is simulated, &c.Now, it appears to us, that when the seller remains ia actual possessionwithout a reservation of usufruct, retention of the propertysold under color of any precarious title, the same, or perhaps astronger reason may exist to induce a belief that the sale was simulatedand fraudulent. Indeed, it is believed to be a principle recognizedin all systems of jurisprudence, that where the seller ofproperty keeps possession, this circumstance constitutes an indicium,or badge of fraud in relation to third persons ; and perhapsproperty thus circumstanced might be legally seized by creditorsof the vendor, without compelling them to resort to actions ofnullity to set aside such contracts, and that the mere mention ofdelivery in the act of sale ought not to defeat the right which creditorshave to seize property as belonging to a vendor before tradition.In the present instance before the purchaser is shown to have beenin possession of the property sold, under another title than thatacquired by the sale, viz. as agent for the seller. Thus situated,the slaves, which were apparently the property of the plaintiff, bothby sale, evidenced by notorial act, and by actual possession, couldnot legally be seized as belonging to the defendant in execution,by the judgment creditor, without causing the sale of the plaintiffto be annulled by an action directly instituted for that purpose.(B.)

With respect to a devise to a slave, it is held in all the states but Maryland,that such devise is void. Slaves cannot take by sale, devise, or descent. Cunninghamv. Cunningham, C. & N. 353.

And see Hallv. Mullin, 5 Har. & Johns. Rep. 190.In some of the states the owners of slaves may manumit them by will.

BY PAROL CONTRACT.1.STRAWBRIDGE v. WARFIELD. April T. 1832. 4 LouisianaRep. 21. ; ROBINEAU v. Corner, 1 N. S. 456. ; HIGHLANDER v. FLUKE, 5 Martin s Rep. 442. ; MADRY v.YOUNG, 3 Louisiana Rep. 160.Per Cur. Porter, J. The judge of the court of the first instance,considered the verbal sale of the slave was null. But we cdiffer with him on this point. On the provisions of the old code, rol proof.60 SLAVERY.the jurisprudence of this court was settled, that parties had a rightto admit a parol contract for the sale of immovable property ; andif they choose they might, as they did in this instance, admit parolevidence to prove it. The late amendments to the Louisiana codehave not changed those of the civil code, except in recognizing thevalidity of a verbal sale, and in establishing, by their authority, thedoctrine that the exclusion of parol testimony in relation to contractsof the description of that before us, is a privilege which theparties may waive.2.BANK S ADM R v. MARKSBERRY. Spring T. 1828. 3 LITTLE SRep. 275.But the Per Cur. It was urged, that the gift of the slaves was void,be V deserters having been no delivery of them to the donees. There ised, or the no d ou bt that, to the completion of a parol gift, the delivery of themu^fbe by thing is essential ; but we apprehend this principle does not ap-continuepty to a gift by deed, if the deed be founded on a good considerst i on The relation of father and child, which subsisted in thistion. *Voluntary gifts and grants are valid between the parties, and are held good whenthe interests of third persons are not affected. Possession should accompany the gift;Or, in other words, a change of possession should take place. It is a controvertedquestion, whether the possession of the goods remaining in the vendor or donor is, orisnot, conclusive evidence of fraud; or whether it is only prima facie evidence of it,and therefore a proper subject for the jury to examine into and decide. The distinctionprobably, in a great measure, is determined by the nature of the conveyance, ortransfer of the property. If the instrument of conveyance be absolute and unconditionalon its face, it is held, the possession must pass to the vendee or donee, otherwisethe transaction will be held fraudulent by the court. This principle was stated andacted upon by Ch. J. Marshall, in Hamilton v. Russel, 1 Crunch s Rep. $09. Thechief justice observed, that modern decisions have determined, that an unconditionalsale where the possession does not accompany and follow the deed, is, in respect tocreditors, by the statute of Elis., a fraud, and should be so determined by the court.And the principle is sustained by many oases in the courts of the several states. Pattonv. Smith, 4 Conn. Rep. 455.; Talcott v. Wilcox, 9 Conn. Rep. 134.; Young v.Pate, 4 Yerger s Rep. 164.; Clow v. Woods, 5 S. & R. 275.; Babe v. Clemson, 10S. & R, 419. But in the case of Sydney v. Gee, 4 Leigh s Virginia Rep. 525., whichwas a bill of sale absolute for certain slaves, and a delivery to the vendee, and a deliveryback to the vendor at hire for the price of their board the court, Tucker, J.,observed, that innumerable instances of delivery and re-delivery are unassailable. Ibuy a horse from a countryman, and the seller immediately borrows him to save himselfthe fatigue of travelling home on foot. I buy a slave in midsummer which I shallnot want till Christmas, and hire him to the vendor for the residue of the year. I investmoney in slaves, not to till my land, but to let to hire. I think these are cases ofconstructive fraud. It is strongly mv impression, that the failure to deliver possession,where no real fraud is intended, does not attach fraud to the transaction forever ; andOF TITLE TO SLAVES. 61case, is a consideration of this sort. Such a consideration, whencoupled in a deed, was, at common law, held sufficient to create atrust in real estate, which would be decreed in a court of equity ;and under the statute of uses is sufficient to transfer the use intopossession, and thus complete the legal title in cestui que use ; andmuch more ought such a consideration be deemed sufficient tosupport a deed alienating the personal estate.3.GAUNT v. Blackman. Spring T. 1808. Hardin s Rep. 331. ;TURNER v. TURNER, 1 Wash. Rep. 139.It was held by the court, that after the passage of the act of A parolVirginia, 1758, and before the operation of the act of 1785, a pa fives berylgift of slaves was void as between donor and donee, as well asagainst creditors. But now a parol gift of slaves is valid. See absolutelyLucy v. Wilson, 4 Munf. Rep. 313. ; Fitzhugh v. Anderson et al., ginia.2 Hen. Munf. 289. ; Moore s Adm r. v. Dawned, 3 Hen. &Munf. 127. ; Outright v. Eggs, 4 Munf. Rep. 145. ; Johnson v.Henley, 5 Munf. Rep. 219. In most of the states the statute offrauds has been considered as made to protect creditors and purchasers,and a parol contract for the sale of goods and chattels,and sales and gifts of slaves, have been held valid as between theparties themselves, and are only void when creditors are hinderedor delayed, or the rights of third persons affected. See the casesAbridged, and Goodwin v. Morgan, 1 Stewart s Rep. 278. ; 1Hayww. Rep. 289.that a subsequent delivery will make it valid against all subsequent creditors and purchasers.In New York it is the impression at the bar, that the English rule recognizedin Sturtevaut v. Ballard, 9 Johns. Rep. 337., that where possession does not accompanyan unconditional sale of goods, it is evidence of fraud per se, is overruled by thecases of Ludlow. Kurd, 19 Johns Rep. 221., and Bissel v. Hopkins, 3Cowen sRep.166. And the same principle was recognised in Brooks v. Powers, 15 Mass. Rep.244. But admitting the rule to be as laid down in Bissel v. Hopkins, that the possessionremaining in the vendor or donor is only prim* facie evidence of fraud, still, ifthe party is unable to show that the possession is bonafide, and the transaction fair andhonest, it becomes conclusive evidence of fraud, and the jury must find accordingly.In Talcott v. Wilcox, 7 Conn. Rep. 134. 140, Bissel, J., observed, that it is undoubtedly,as has been contended, the settled law of this state, that if the vendor of personalproperty be permitted after the sale to retain the actual and visible possession, it is,unexplained, conclusive evidence of fraud.62 SLAVERY.4.FARRELL v.

The plaintiff s testator took the negro woman into hisparties and p Esse sion, but afterwards loaned her to his mother. In the yearvolunteers Junder 1793, his mother intermarried with one Hargrove, an old servantis void on in the family of Major Strudwick. The mother, during her wi-creditors6 boyhood, always stated the slave and her children to be the propertyand pur o f her son, plaintiffs testator, as did also Hargrove after his purchasersareconcerned, nage ; and at one period Hargrove sent them home to Lynch ; butsoon after they were sent back. In the year 1804, Hargrove andhis wife separated ; he removed to a tract of land which life obtainedfrom Mrs. Strudwick, carrying the slaves in dispute with him.On the I Both of August, 1805, Hargrove gave Mrs. Strudwick abill of sale for the slaves, and at the same time Strudwick conveyedto Hargrove an estate for life in a tract of land by deed, in whichit was mentioned, that Hargrove was to retain possession of theslaves during his life. In October, 1805, Hargrove re-conveyedhis interest in the land to Strudwick. It was proved that StrudwickOF TITLE TO SLAVES. 63had paid some small debts for Hargrove, and expressed a wish tohave the use of the slaves while Hargrove lived, saying, that at hisdeath they should go to the rightful owner. In March, 1815, Hargrove died, and plaintiff s testator obtained possession of the slaves,and kept them about a month, when Strudwick again obtainedpossession of them. The defendant claimed as distributee underStrudwick. Lynch died, and his executor brought this actionwithin three years next after Strudwick got the slaves out of thepossession of Lynch.The court instructed the jury, that (without deciding whetherthe purchaser intended to be protected by the act of 1784,was one from the donor, or might be from any person claimingunder the donor,) it was at least necessary to show that Strudwickwas a bona fide purchaser for a valuable consideration ; that a colorableconsideration would not destroy the plaintiff s title ; that ifthey believed from the evidence, that Hargrove s possession wasnot an adverse possession, it availed the defendant nothing ; and thusthe act of 1 806 did not merge, or destroy the plaintiff s title, althoughHargrove or Strudwick had the negroes in adverse possessionupwards of three years after that act went into operation ; becauseThomas Lynch, the plaintiff s testator, had regained the possession1815, and kept them in his undisturbed possession for one month,or thereabouts, at which time the title and possession were unitedin Lynch. And as this was in three years next before the commencementof the action, the act of limitation did not protect thedefendant. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff. A motionfor a new trial was moved for, on the ground of misdirection as tothe law. The motion was overruled, and from the judgment rendereddefendant appealed.Henderson, J. I am of opinion that the law was correctly laiddown by the presiding judge, in his charge to the jury : for, howevermuch we may now regret that the act of 1784 was not construedas a statute of frauds, avoiding all parol gifts of slaves, aswell between the parties, as where creditors and purchasers wereconcerned, it is now too firmly settled, by a uniform train of decisions,to be even questioned, that as between the parties, andvolunteers under them, the transfer is good, and that it is voidonly where creditors and purchasers are concerned ; nor can weadopt the expedient pressed upon us from the bar, that we wouldin this case give to the act what we consider to be its true construction,as there has been no decision that a fraudulent or coloredSLAVERY.able purchaser was not within the prohibition of the act. Thiswould, to our understanding, be something like a subterfuge ; theprotection of the act is afforded to a purchaser on account of hismerits, not his demerits. We cannot perceive the situation of afraudulent and colorable purchaser to be better than that of theperson from whom he purchased. Can title be strengthened byadding a fraudulent link to the chain ? It appears to me, that ifeither is to be preferred, it is the original party ; if Strudwicktherefore was a fraudulent or colorable purchaser, (and this factwas properly left to the Jury,) he and his voluntary representativesstand in the situation of the husband, Hargrove, from whom hepurchased ; and as the parol gift, if made, was binding upon Hargrove, it is binding on the defendant A she, who is a volunteerunder Strudwick. Judgment for the plaintiff.6.MARY Coat v. JOHN WRIGHT. June T. 1830. 2 Devereaux sNorth Carolina Rep. 289.; GOODWIN v.

The defendant, under the general issue,slave ac ~ ave j n evidence that an execution against one Islam Choat, camebydeiive d to his hand, as sheriff, under which he seized the slave, and the"and" trans only question was, whether the defendant in this execution had afers the ti tit j e to fa Q g | ave Qn the evidence it appeared that the slave hadwithstand been the property of one Sybert Choat, and was by the plaintiff,o? sale b is as his executrix, set up at public auction, and stricken off to Islamexecuted, c/w>ai ai QQ Q dollars ; that the slave was delivered to the vendee ;nor any . . .membrane ut no bill of sale, nor any memorandum of the sale in writing,c d o U ilu4 f t the was executed by the plaintiff.

Averdict was returned for the defendant, and the plaintiff appealed.Ruffin, J. We should lend a ready ear to any plausible argument,tending to prove that this case is within the statue of frauds ;(Act of 1819. Rev. ch. 1016. ;) for we feel that all the mischiefsare as apt to arise out of executed, as executory contracts. Butthe words are too strong and plain to be got over. We think itextremely probable, that the draftsman considered, when he putlands and slaves on the same footing, that he required all contractsrespecting each to be in writing. If he did, it was a great mistake.However the words of the act may be construed, if applied toOF TITLE TO SLAVES. 65slaves alone, they cannot embrace executed contracts, when appliedto both. The act says, that " all contracts to sell convey lands orslaves shall be void and of no effect, unless such contract, or somememorandum, or note thereof, be put in writing, and signed bythe party charged, except contracts for leases not exceedingthree years." The question is, what sort of contracts is here meant]Certainly, only such a contract respecting slaves is within the actas would also be within it if it respected land ; for the two subjectsare placed side by side. It is perfectly clear, that executory contractsalone can be meant when land is the subject. For before thattime, a conveyance of freehold land could be by deed only, and itis absurd to talk about " a note or memorandum in writing," as athing that can pass such lands. In relation, therefore, to realty,not only the words of the act, " a contract to sell," but thestate of the law before, restrains the statute to executory contracts.This ties us down, against our wills, to the same construction as regardsslaves. Therefore, a sale of slaves by parol, that would havebeen good before the statute is still good. We are aware of the greatinconveniences that will arise from this construction ; and that hasmade us very reluctant to adopt it. For the same fraud and persfury will be practised in the dispute, whether the contract was oneto sell," or "of sale," as in ascertaining the particular terms of acontract to sell, and thus all the benefits intended by the legislaturebe defeated. But the framing of the act compels us to pronouncethe judgment we do. Judgment affirmed.7.MORROW et al. v. WILLIAMS. Dec. T. 1831. 3 Devereaux sNorth Carolina Rep. 263.Detinue for a slave.

Several valid objections occur to the claimof the plaintiffs. The first is, that the gift is not established by adeed, or, in its absence, by evidence of a delivery: the writing introducedand relied upon, not being under seal, is nothing morethan the declaration of Jemima Brachia, that she gave the negroto her daughter and son-in-law, but there having been no delivery,no title vested in them ; and there being no valuable consideration,no right of property passed from her.

JHathcws, J. The reasons why our legislature, inconformitywith the legislation of France, should have embarrasseddonations with so many forms, are not very palpable andevident to the minds of men who are only conversant with ordinaryaffairs of human life ; in truth, they cannot be considered as veryconspicuous and imposing on those learned in the law. Whyhonest generosity should be thus trammeled, is not easy to accountfor : sed ita lex. In resorting to Collier s Commentary on theCode Napoleon, it is discovered that tradition, ?. e. delivery demmu in manum, of moveables, according to the decisions of thecourts of justice in France, dispenses with many, if not all theforms prescribed by the Code for the perfection of donations. See5 Collier, p. 181 184. Want of estimation of the propertygiven is cured by delivery of moveables. The 48th article of ourlate civil Code is, verbatim, that of the 948th article of the FrenchOF TITLE TO SLAVES. 67Code, except that ours provides expressly in the same manner forthe donation of slaves, and requires that an estimate should bemade of them, and signed by both donor and donee, c. Therecan be no doubt, according to the interpretation giver* to this lawby French jurists, and which we believe to be correct, of traditionof moveables obviating the invalidity of a donation, which wouldotherwise take place for want of an estimate. The only questionwhich remains for examination is, whether the delivery of slaves,under a deed of grant, made and accepted in due form, will, agreeablyto general rules of property in this state, produce the sameeffect 1 The principle reason which seems to have influenced theopinions and decisions of those who have considered tradition ofmoveable property, made in pursuance of a will to give, as sufficientto cure all defects of form in donations, is, that possession ofthis kind of property is held to be equivalent to title, or in otherwords, to be evidence of title. But according to our laws in relationto titles by which property is held, a written instrument is requiredin order to transfer slaves from one proprietor to another ;and when the evidence offered in support of title to them is an actof donation, to give it validity, it must appear clothed with all theformalities required by law, and sanctioned by an authentic deed.Mere possession is not evidence of title. In the present case, thenotarial act is invalid, for want of the estimate required by the code,and is therefore no evidence of title in the donee, because donationscannot be supported by any instrument inferior to authenticacts. In this species of contract forms appear to assume theplace of substance. From the foregoing review of the case, therecan be no difficulty in perceiving the difference in the legal principleswhich govern it, from those on which the decisions were made,relative to synallagmatic contracts, relied on by the counsel forthe appellants.

Fall T. 4 Bibb s Rep. 459.When hir Held by the court, that the sale of a negro while she was hiredto another, transfers the possession, as well as right of property ;and the bill of sale is not, as to creditors, fraudulent per se, becausepossession was not actually given to the purchaser at thetime. The slave at the time of the sale was hired out, but theowner might nevertheless sell him. The right to dispose of property,though not in the possession of the vendor, but which washeld under him, was decided in Bullock v. M Calla, 2 Bibb sRep. 289. If, then, the right may be thus transferred in the slave,the subsequent holding by the person who had hired, ought not tobe treated as the possession of the seller.11.Garfield v. HEWLET.

DESTREHAN. April T. 1824. 14 Martin s LouisianaRep. 389.Per Cur. Porter, J. The plaintiff sued to recover a female slave, Thewho had been illegally and forcibly taken out of his possession-Jjf ^The judge below decreed he should recover, but condemned him negro isto pay the price of the negro, because she had been stolen, and tied to de-purchasedby the defendant at public auction. Both parties appealedfrom this judgment. The evidence proves the identity of the slave, the lawfulthat she was part of the estate of one William Rutland, deceased ;and came into the possession of the plaintiff as guardian to WilliamRutland, jun. The title under which defendant claims is ofa date previous to this, and nothing shows any right in the personfrom whom it emanated. The plaintiff, therefore, is entitled torecover, and the only question which remains to examine, is, whetherhe must reimburse the defendant the price he has paid forher. His obligation to do so has been contended in this court to70 SLAVERY.result from the provision in the code, which declares, that thingsmoveable may be prescribed for in three years, unless they havebeen stolen ; and even if they have been stolen, the owner cannotrecover them without paying the possessor the price which theycost him, provided he bought them at a public market, fair, or ata public auction. Civil Code, 488., art. 74, 75. Slaves, bythe laws of this country, are considered as immoveable, not moveable; therefore, the above rule does not apply to them. The reasonupon which that rule was established, also excludes the idea ofits having any application to this kind of property. It does notpass by delivery, but by writing, and the purchaser should look totitle, and not to possession, as evidence of ownership. It is thereforeordered, adjudged, and decreed, that the judgment of the districtcourt be annulled, avoided, and reversed ; and it is furtherordered, adjudged, and decreed, that the plaintiff recover of thedefendant the slave claimed in the petition, with costs in bothcourts.14.DUPREE v.

It appears to me that the delivery of thenegroes to the husband immediately after the marriage, may wellbe presumed to have been in consideration of marriage.2.TAYLOR v. Banks. Spring T. 1821. 3 Marshall s Rep. 239.Detinue for a slave. It appeared that George G.

Verdict for defendant; and * e id ? lft it iaTaylor appealed. the intentto defraud,Per Cur. Oicsley, J. II by the instruction given it was intended that viti-by the court to decide, that under the statute against fraudulent g^conveyances generally, the mere circumstance of a father beingindebted at the time of making the conveyance, does, within itself,as matter of law, render a gift made to the son, in consideration ofnatural love and affection, void as to creditors, we entertain nodoubt the instruction cannot be sustained. The statute of this72 SLAVERY.country, which was taken from, and contains, in substance, theprovisions of the 1 3 and 27 Elisabeth, no doubt makes void allconveyances made with an intention to hinder, delay, or defraudcreditors ; but it is the fraudulent intent with which the conveyanceis made, and not the circumstance of the alienor being at the timeindebted, that makes the conveyance void.From his being indebted, an intent to defraud may be presumed ;but it is a presumption which may be repelled by other evidence,and which should be made by the jury, and not the court. Theremay be cases where, from particular facts, it would be proper forthe court to infer a fraudulent intent ; but those are cases wherefromthe facts, the law itself implies the intent, and allows the introductionof no evidence to repel the implication. But the circumstanceof being indebted is not such a fact from which the lawimplies an intention in the person conveying, in consideration ofnatural love and affection to defraud his creditors.TAYLOR, EX R OF ROWLEY, v.

Allen becoming embarrassed,Mr. Byrd executed a deed of trust to the plaintiff of the ne-band.goes, for the use of his daughter, Mrs. Allen. The negroes weresold by an execution creditor of Allen. Verdict for plaintiff, andmotion for a new trial.OF TITLE TO SLAVES. 73Per Cur. Aotf, J. Permitting negroes to go home with adaughter, on her marriage, has always been considered as primafacie evidence of an unconditional gift ; and the only question nowfor our consideration is, whether this case is an exception to thegeneral rule. One of the slaves remained four years in Allen sfamily. Such a length of possession would give a statutory right,and would he conclusive evidence of the intention of the parent.And after that period the father of Mrs. Allen could not, by avoluntary settlement, defeat the rights of creditors. The inferencefrom the facts is, that the property must be considered asbelonging to Allen, and subject to the payment of his debts. Iam of opinion, that the verdict in this case is contrary both to lawand evidence, and that a new trial ought to be granted.5.CLUNG v. Lockhart.

The plaintiff proved the defendant sent his And it isslave to plaintiff s house about a year after he had married the de wSe^ 1fendant s daughter, where the slave remained until the death of the the slav . edaughter, when the defendant took the slave away.The court charged the jury that the rule of law was, that wherea parent suffered property to go with a child upon marriage, a sent "gift was implied ; but it did not extend to this case. Here theproperty went into the possession of the son-in-law a year aftermarriage. Verdict for defendant, and the plaintiff appealed. Thecourt, Colcock, J., held, that the charge of the court was wrong,and a new trial must be granted.6.MAHAN v. JAMES.

BY THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.*1.Hardest v. HAYS. March T. 1833. 4 Yerger s Rep. 507.This was an action of detinue, brought by Samuel Hays againstAlthough, - , ,by the state plaintiff in error, Hardeson, to recover two slaves, Rachel anaNorth f Ca her child, which Hays claimed as his property. It appeared fromthe evidence, that the plaintiff below was the original owner ofSaves must the slaves ; that William Hays, under whom the defendant below,or writing, Hardeson, claimed, married the daughter of the plaintiff, Samuele - Hays, in North Carolina, in 1811 ; that between that year andhyoid; 1818, several slaves had been sent by Samuel Hays to Williamyet, where . 1010*1, i r>the gift was Hays, which were returned ; that in January, 1818, the girland P ihedo- ciel was sent in exchange for one previously sent ; that from 1818,nee had ^jj William Hays moved to Tennessee, in 1826, Rachel remain-possessionsclaiming e( j in his possession, except a few weeks, now and then, when shety e a? hST r ~ was at Samuel Hays ; that William Hays claimed her as his own,tutor y th e r ~ and exercised acts of ownership over her ; that when he removedgift more to Tennessee he carried Rachel with him ; that she continued inyears, it his possession until he sold her to Hardeson, which was nearly fivethat the d ti years ; but Hardeson did not have her in possession three yearsthe before this suit was brought against him. Hardeson gave Williamvested in Hays three hundred and thirty dollars for Rachel, her child notoHimT- then being born. The laws of North Carolina, which were readactin evidence, required that the gift should be in writing, or it was subsequently] u tell void to all intents. The jury, under the charge of the court,purchaser returned a verdict for the plaintiff. Such parts of the charge asn him. t ^ e cour t deemed material or necessary to notice, are contained inthe opinion delivered by Judge Green.The statutes of limitations, in reference to this species of property, are various inthe different states where such property exists. In some of the states the limitationis three years, in others it is five. But in all of them the general principles applicableto the possession of chattels, prevail. An adverse possession under the statute for thetime limited, gives the possessor a valid title, which he may avail himself of, in anaction against, him to recover the possession by a plea; or, if dispossessed, may recover theslave on the strength of the title gained by force of the statute. And where thepossession is not adverse, and consequently the statute does not apply, a possession oftwenty years as loanee or mortgagee will give a title. The court will consider theabsolute right to the property is in the possessor, by force of the length of possession.OF TITLE TO SLAVES 75Per Cur. Green, J. The Court in this case charged the jury,in substance, that if the slave, for the recovery of whom this suitwas brought, was given to William Hays, of whom defendant purchasedher, in North Carolina, by the plaintiff, yet the gift not beingby deed, proved and registered as required by the laws of thatstate, it would not pass the title, and that the possession of WilliamHays would be the possession of the plaintiff; so that the statuteof limitations could not operate against the plaintiff; and thatif William Hays brought the negro to Tennessee, and had her inpossession in Tennessee more than five years, and then sold herto the defendant, that neither the statute of frauds nor the statuteof limitations could operate to confer a title, or bar the plaintiff srecover, unless the defendant had the negro in possession morethan three years after his purchase from William Hays, in thischarge the circuit court clearly mistook the law. Although theact of North Carolina of 1806, ch. 701. sec. 1., requires that agift of slaves should be by deed proved and registered, yet, whenthe parol gift of the slave was made, William Hays held for himself,and not for the plaintiff, who had made the gift. No trustwas created between the parties, as would have been the casehad the slave been loaned ; but the possession was, in law and infact, exclusively for himself, and adverse to all the world. Havingthus an adverse possession in North Carolina and Tennessee,for ten years, the plaintiff is barred by the statute of limitations,In Kegler v. Mills, 2 Martin & Yerger s Rep. 426., this court decided,that an adverse possession, so long as to bar the plaintiff saction against the possession, vested in him an absolute right to theproperty. The length of his possession, it being adverse, vestedin William Hays an absolute right to the property, which wastransferred by his deed to the defendant The court thereforeerred in telling the jury that William Hays had not such an adversepossession, in favor of which the statute of limitations could operate; and also, in telling them the defendant could not relyupon the previous possession of William Hays, and that to be protected,he must appear to have been three years in possession ofthe slave himself. Judgment reversed,76 SLAVERY.2.Parted v. Badges et al. March T. 1833. 4 Yerger s Tenn.Rep. 174.Three In this case the ancestor of defendants in error was originallyverse pos the owner of the sav es in controversy. The plaintiff claimedskye n ives f ts them by s ft from ils father > and held Averse possession 6f themthe right of from the year 1821 until the year 1827, when the defendants inmtEepo*. error retook them into their possession. This suit was then broughtagainst them, and the jury, under the charge of the court, found averdict in favor of the defendants in error. Upon which judgmentwas rendered. The court was requested to charge the jury, thatif the slaves in question were more than three years in the adversepossession of the plaintiff, the defendants were barred by the act oflimitations, and could not recover them by law ; and having regainedthe possession, could not hold them against the plaintiff. Thecourt refused so to charge ; but stated to the jury, that the act oflimitations only barred the remedy, and not the right, and thoughthe defendant could not recover by suit, yet, if their title was goodbefore it was barred, they had a right of reception at any time afterwards; and having got the slaves in their possession after theiraction was barred, they thereby resorted to their first right, andthe plaintiff in such case could not be aided hy the statute.Per Cur. Peck, J. The question presented by this recordarises upon the charge of the court. The circuit was of opinion,that the plaintiff could acquire no right of property in the slavesby virtue of an adverse possession, sufficient in point of time to formabar under the act of limitations ; that the remedy of the partywho had the title was only barred, and not his right of property,and consequently the right of reception existed. In personal actionsto enforce executory contracts, the statute of limitation only operatesa bar upon the remedy ; hence a distinct and unequivocalacknowledgment will revive the debt. But in relation to the c titleto personal property, the rule is, and from necessity must be, different.In such case, the uninterrupted adverse enjoyment for theperiod prescribed by the statutes vests the right of property in thepossessor, unless prevented by some of the exceptions in the statute.Without detailing the dangerous consequences to society,the violence, the prostration of all good order, which would resultfrom the adoption of a contrary doctrine, it is sufficient for us tosay, that the question has been settled in this state, in the case ofOF TITLE TO SLAVES. 77Higher v. Miles, Martin & Yerger s Rep. The decision in thatcase is amply sustained by the authorities referred to. We are ofopinion that the circuit court erred in its charge to the jury uponthis point, for which error the judgment must be reversed, and thecause remanded.3.SHELBY et al. v. GREY. Feb.

Lately, 3 Hen. of& Munf. 57., a case strikingly resembling this in its circumstances,it was adjudged that a plaintiff, in Virginia, may recover in detinue, Virginia,r ,, . upon whichupon five years peaceable possession of a slave acquired without the posses-forceor fraud. And four months after that decision, and obviouslywithout being apprised of it, this court, in the case of Brent, v. detinue -Chapman, 5 Cranch s Rep. 353., maintained the same doctrine ;and such a possession constitutes a good title in Tennessee.4.SMART v. Laugh. Spring T. 1830. 3 J. J. Marshall sRep. 363.Smart sued Baugh, in detinue, for a slave named Catharine. And theSmart claimed the slave in right of his wife, a daughter of Williaman d Eleanor Johnson, by a parol gift by her grandfather, PeterDopp, to her, of a female slave named Nancy, the mother of Cathy tucky.arise, in the year 1790. Baugh claimed under the will of Mrs.Johnson, her grandmother, and the mother of Smart s wife. Theslave Nancy went into the possession of Johnson and wife. WilliamJohnson died in 1819, and Mrs. Johnson, his wife, died in1826. Johnson devised property to Smart s wife and other relatives,and Mrs. Johnson devised property to them also, and Catharine,a child of Nancy, to the defendant, her grand daughter, andthe devisees took under each of the wills.The court charged the jury, that the plaintiff could not claimunder, and also against the wills ; and that if he had accepted, andheld property under one or both of them, and to which he had no78 SLAVERY.other valid right than that he so derived, they should find for thedefendant.2d. That if those from whom the defendant derived her claimhad been in possession of Catharine more than five years beforethe institution of this suit, holding her adversely to the claim ofthe plaintiff, his right was barred, and he coulcTnot recover.Per Cur. Robinson, Ch. J. As a general rule of law, it iswell settled, that a person who claims the property under a will,cannot recover on a claim adverse to the will, other property whichit devised to another person. Therefore, if A. devises to B. propertywhich belongs to C., and also devises other property to C.,C. must elect to yield his right to property devised to B., or|hecannot hold that which is devised to himself. Groves v. Menonand Wife, 6 Monroe s Rep. 635.As to the second point in the charge, five years uninterruptedadverse, possession of a slave, not only bars the remedy of the realowner, but vests an absolute legal right in the possessor ; andproof of such possession may show that the claimant has no rightto the slave, and cannot recover. And five years adverse possessionof a slave may vest such a title as will enable the possessorto maintain action for the slave ; the same right, so acquired,may be proved by him under the general issue, in a suit broughtagainst him for the slave, by the person against whom he had heldadversely. Judgment affirmed.5.GARTH S EX RS v. BARKSDALE. 5 Munf. Rep. 101.Even Held by the court, that five years peaceable and uninterruptedslaves are possession of slaves, under a loan, not evidenced by deed dulyloanee. recorded, vests a title in the loanee, which enures in favor of hiscreditors, and cannot be detested, as to them, by returning thesame to the lender, after the five years have elapsed. And in Gayv. Mostly, 2 Munf. Rep. 543., the court held, that a slave lenteither before or after the act to prevent frauds and perjuries, andhaving remained, since the commencement of that act, more thanfive years in the loanee s possession, without any demand havingbeen made on the part of the lender, must be considered the absoluteproperty of the person so remaining in possession, as to creditorsof, and purchasers under him.OF TITLE TO SLAVES. 796.FITZHUGH v.

The circumstancethat the father afterwards, by his last will and testament, bequeathedthe slaves to his son for life, remainder to his children, makes nodifference in the case.

It appears by the bill of exceptions, that the defend-than20 ants attempted to maintain the title of their intestate by proving,which a h ft e er thatdurin the revolutionary war, he was an officer in the ten^sseSfon months service in South Carolina ; that an officer in that serviceand it was was entitled to two confiscated slaves ; that the mother of Nuda,by raTwho the slave in controversy, was allotted to him as one of those toSettle t[ which he was entitled ; and there being no express proof that anycourt held other was allotted to him, it was inferred that Juda, who was thenpossession a suckling child, was given to him as the other to which he waspfainlift entity] ed. On the other hand, it was positively proved that Juda,ab ut the cl SG f the revolution T war > wa given to the wife ofevidenceof the plaintiff, as a compensation for her trouble in taking care ofthe other confiscated slaves, and that she then obtained possessionof her, claiming her as her own, and continued to hold her untilshe intermarried with the plaintiff, who has held her as his propertyever since, until within less than five years before the commencementof this suit, when the defendant obtained possessionof Juda, and her children, born while in. the possession of theOF TITLE TO SLAVES. 81plain stiff.

Supplsing the defendant s intestate to have had good title to Juda, disfigureto assert that title for a period of het ween 20 and 30 years, duringall of which time the plaintiff and his wife held possession of Juda,claiming her as their own, must excite an irresistible presumption,that he had parted with his title, and that the right of property wasin the possession.

A verdict ofnonsuit was entered, and Russell appealed.Per Cur. Buckner, J, The nonsuit was entered on the groundthat the administratrix had not consented that Achilles Sneedshould take the slaves.It has been contended in argument, that the assent of theadministrator must be presumed after the lapse of 20 years fromthe time that letters of administration were granted ; that a jurymay at all events rationally draw such an inference from the lapseof such time only, because it would bar all personal actions, and byits own force pay all debts. This position has not been supportedby the citation of any authority ; nor can the argument be sustainedon principles of reason, however plausible it may be. The lapseof 20 years from the grant of administration is not sufficient of itselfto raise a presumption that the administrator has consented that thedistributees may take the slaves which belong to the intestate s estate; nor can a jury, from the lapse of 20 years from the grant ofadministration, rationally infer that the administrator has consented82 SLAVERY.that the distributees should take the slaves which belong to the estateof the intestate.

MITCHELL. Dec. T. 1833. 5 Yerger s Tenn. Rep. 281.This suit was brought to recover a slave. The plaintiff proved An infantthat the slave had been given to him whilst an infant ; that at the ^ a v y er ^ e oldtime of making the gift, possession of the slave was given to his possessionguardian, and that he had remained with his guardian for three years, either byand more, before he came to the possession of the defendant. gordian, rThe court charged the jury, that possession of a slave for three and su . chpossessionyears by an infant claiming the slave as his own, would communi for threecate no title to the infant, as the infant could not hold adversely un vestige ti-tilhe arrived at the age of twenty-one years. llavehitheThe jury found a verdict for the defendant, and a motion for a infant.new trial having been made and overruled, the plaintiff prosecutesthis writ of error to this court.Per Cur. Green, J. The court further charged, that " a possessionof three years by an infant would not be an adversepossession, nor until the child arrived at twenty-one could be adverse."In this, also, there is error. The possession of an infant,either by himself or his guardian, may as well be adverse as to allother titles, as though he were an adult. Infancy protect a partyfrom the consequences of many of his acts; but no one else cantake advantage of that infancy. Judgment reversed.17.Kepler v. MILES. Jan. T. 1825. Martin & Yerger s TennesseeRep. 426.Per Cur. Catron, J. In this cause, the facts are substantially The ad-these: Hart well Miles, in 1815, was very dissipated, and had g^o/ofawasted most of his property, and was tending towards insolvency, slave soWm. Boyd paid his debts, and took his plantation in payment, bar ac-somenegroes were left ; of one of them, now in controversy, hemade a bill of sale to his daughter Nancy, then about 14 years brought a-, T . . . gainst theold. No consideration was given, and it was made avowedly in possession,anticipation of future insolvency. In 1816, or 1817, Nancy mar Jred David Kegler, the plaintiff ; the slave was taken into Kegler spossession, by virtue of the bill of sale, and continued so until 1822, ty.when Nancy, the wife, died, leaving two children. Kegler then84 SLAVERY.resided in Mississippi. Kegler, soon after the death of his wife, returnedto the house of his father-in-law, Hartwell Miles, in Davidsoncounty, Tennessee, with the negro girl and his two children.He made a deed of gift of the girl to the children, which was dulyacknowledged, and registered in Davidson county. The bill ofsale made by Hartwell Miles to his daughter, in 1816, was notregistered until 1825, after the suit was brought. Soon aftermaking the deed of gift, Kegler left Tennessee, leaving the negrogirl and his children with Hartwell Miles. In 1823, HartwellMiles took the negro to Rutherford county, and sold her to PeterN. Smith, and made a bill of sale for her, which was duly provenand recorded. Smith paid a full price, and believed he was acquiringa good title. He loaned the slave to his brother-in-law,Thomas Miles, who was sued in this action of Kegler s children.The jury found for the plaintiffs, upon the complicated matters oflaw and of fact arising-under the statute of frauds and registryacts. The court charged the jury. A new trial was moved for,and refused ; and the whole evidence set out. That Nancy Miles, beforeher intermarriage with Kegler, acquired no valid title, as againsta purchaser from Hartwell Miles, is a perplexed question of lawand fact ; that Kegler acquired any title in consideration of themarriage, depends upon facts, doubtful in their character. Therecan be little doubt he claimed title by virtue of the bill of sale tohis wife only. But one simple and undisputed fact exists in thecause, to wit: that Kegler took possession of the slave as his own,and held her as such adversely to all others, for more than threeyears before he conveyed to his children. That the art of limitationsgave him a good title to defend himself, and barred theremedy of all others, is certain ; but did it vest in Kegler an absolutetitle, which he could assert as plaintiff? is the question. It iscontended, that the remedy of Hartwell Miles was barred, but theright remained ; consequently, if he got possession of the slave byrecaption, the right and possession were again united ; of which he,or those claiming under him, could not be deprived by Kegler, towhom the statute gave the power of resistance, as a defendant,vesting no right that could be asserted as plaintiff; that the statutealone operated upon the remedy, without touching the right.Such are the reasonings upon the statute, when applied to debtorand creditor in the English and American courts. That a claimbarred by time is a good consideration for a new promise, is settledbeyond controversy. Clements v. Williams, 8 Cranch sOF TITLE TO SLAVES. 85Rep. 72. 74.; 3 Munf. Rep. 181. 197.; Bell v. Rolandson, Hardins Rep. 301. Does the same rule apply to the slave propertyof the slave holding states? In the application of the statute tothis description of property, the American courts, of necessity,must fix rules of their own ; it is peculiar in its character ; andEnglish jurisprudence furnishes no precedents that can materiallyaid us. The slave passes by deed, and is not regularly assets inthe hands of the administrator. All the other goods must first beexhausted, and their the county court will order the sale of theslaves. Our laws, and those of Virginia, equally in force in Kentuckyin these respects, are the same in substance. Were the doctrinescontended for by the counsel for the plaintiff in error the trueones, this consequence would follow : A. gets possession of B s.female slave, say in Virginia, brings her here, sells her to an innocentpurchaser, who keeps her ten or twenty years; she then hasincrease ; the right of the mother is in the Virginia claimant ; theincrease follow, of course, the original right : before the child isthree years old, the original claimant sues for, and recovers it. Didthe woman have ten children, all would be recovered in the samemanner. The use of the mother would be in one man ; the rightunbarred, to the increase in another. The next consequence is,A. that holds a slave three years, and the remedy is barred as tohim; but the statute communicates no right ; he then sells to B.,who cannot avail himself of the bar formed by the statute in favorof the first possessor, and the latter can be sued at any time withinthree years after his possession is acquired. Such is the doctrinedeclared by Judge Haywwwood/mBlanton v. Caution, 3 Hayww. Rep.155-6. It is also declared, that no property is acquired by threeyears possession ; the remedy by action is barred, but the right ofrecaption exists. No such question was involved in that cause ;and the suggestions made by Judge Hay wood were used as an argumentto prove, that a want of knowledge in the plaintiff wherehis property was, until within three years before action brought,would be a good replication to the statute of limitations. Thecause was again brought before the supreme court, at Sparta, in1825, and was adjudged for the defendant, because the replication,that the plaintiff did not know where his property was, &c., washolden bad, and the suggestions, reported in 3 Haywood, wereoverruled.This decision was in accordance with that of M Ginnis v. Jackand Cock, made at Knoxville, 1825. Nothing could be imagined86 SLAVERY.much more dangerous to the repose of society, than the recognitionof the principle, that although the remedy was barred, theright of recaption existed, in cases of dormant claims to slaves.That this mode of asserting the claim would result in personalviolence of the most dangerous character is certain. No authorityis found giving sanction to such an idea. The better opinion is,that when the right exists unbarred, and the true owner, by violence,or by a tortious and unlawful act, obtains possession of the slave,he shall not be permitted to set up his better title, when sued byhim who was seriously deprived of the possession. To do sowould be to permit the defendant to take advantage of his ownwrong. 3 Hen. & Munf. 61. ; 2 Tenn. Rep. 98. ; 1 Hayvv. Rep.13. ; Act of 1779, ch. 11,; Act of 1799, ch. 28. Slaves havingmind, the rule laid down in 3 Black. Com. 4. must be most cautiouslyapplied. He who holds possession of land peaceably for sevenyears, by virtue of a grant, or deed, acquires a right of soil, and ifturned out of possession may regain it by the action of ejectment.Does the same rule hold in reference to slaves, when the remedyof the owner is barred by three years adverse possession? Sowe hold ; and that three years possession of the slave in question,acquired without fraud or force, gave to David Kegler a legal title toher, and that the plaintiff ought to recover in this action. We feelit our duty, as also our inclination, to follow the decisions of sisterstates where slavery exists. Such has been the course of decisionin Virginia. Newby v. Blakey, 3 Hen. & Munf. 56. 66. In theSupreme Court of the United States. Brent v. Chapman. 5 Cranch sRep. 358., followed in Guy v. Shelby, 11 Wheat, 571., and ofKentucky, in Thompson v. Calc well, 3 Little s Rep. 136.

Under the statute of frauds fiveyears continued possession of a slave, holding the slave upon a frauds,loan, or under the title of another, who claims a reservation, orlimitation of an use, or property in the slave, is rendered fraudulent,as to creditors and purchasers, and the absolute propertydeclared to be with the possession, unless the loan, reservation, orlimitation of use, or property, were declared by will, or deed inThere is an extended and an enlightened review of the authorities in Kent sCom. vol. 2. p. 512., upon the subject, how far the sale of goods is affected by fraud,by the possession not accompanying the sale or transfer. After a review of theEnglish cases, he observes, that the Supreme court of the United States, in Hamiltonv. Russel, 1 Cranch s Rep. 309., have adopted the rule laid down in Edwards v. Harden,3 T. Rep. 618., that if the vendee took an absolute bill of sale, to take effect immediately*by the force of it, and the goods remain in the possession of the vendor for a limitedtime, such absolute conveyance without the possession was such a circumstance aspersf, made the transaction fraudulent in law. Which decision is now obligatory inthe United States courts. The same principle has been adopted in Virginia. Alexanderv. Decease, 2 Munf. Rep. 341. But the principle seems to be modified byLoud v. Jeffries, 5 Rand. Rep. 211., and Clayton v. Anthony, 6 Rand. Rep. 285., andthe cases in the text. The same principle has been adopted in South Carolina.Kennedy v. Ross, 2 Const. Rep. 125. ; Hudnal v. Wilder, 4 M Cord s Rep. 294.But recent cases in that state seem to have adopted the doctrine, that the want of possessionaccompanying an absolute and unconditional sale, is only primaftcie evidenceof fraud. Smith v. Henry, 2 Bailey s Rep. 118. In Kentucky and Tennessee, thecase of Edwards v. Harden, is respected and followed. It would seem, however, thatin Kentucky the principle is modified by the case of Wash v. Medley, 1 Dana s Rep.269. The rule prevails in its full force in Pennsylvania, except in the case of householdgoods. Dawes v. Cope, 4 Binney s Rep. 258. ; Babe v. Clemson, 10 Serg. &Rale, 419. ; Clow v. Woods, 5 S. & R. 275. ; Welsh v. Hayden, 1 Penn. Rep. 57.And the same rule prevails in New Jersey. Chumar v. Wood, 1 Halst. Rep. 155. ;but is qualified by Sterling v. Vancleve, 7 Halst. Rep. 285. So, also, in Connecticut.Patton v. Smith, 5 Conn. Rep. 196.; Smith v. Thompson, 9 Conn. Rep. 63. Soalso, in Vermont, the court held, that in sales of personal property, if the seller remainedin possession after the sale, it is fraudulent and void as to creditors. Boardmanv.

Five years possessiongives an absolute right to the loanee, so far as it relates tocreditors and purchasers, unless a demand has been made and pursued,by the course of law, before the expiration of that period.As, where a person lending slaves, suffers them to remain 5 yearswith the person to whom the loan is made, during which time thepossessor contracts debts, and the lender then retakes the slaves,they are, nevertheless, liable to satisfy those creditors, the loan not50. ; Leaden v. Harris, 3 Dev. Rep. 146. ; and so, also, the same principle is establishedin Tennessee, Callen v. Thompson, 3 Verges Rep. 475. 502. And in NewYork, by the case of Missel. Hopkins, 3 Cowen s Rep. 166, the same principle was recognized.And in New Hampshire, Haven v. Low, 2 N. Lamp. Rep. 13. And inMassachusetts, Brooks v. Powers, 15 Mass. Rep. 244. ; Bartlett v. Williams, 1 Pick.Rep. 288. Chancellor Kent, in the review before referred to, regrets that the principle,whether the absence of possession in the vendee or loanee shall be evidenceof fraud, per se, or only prima facie evidence, and subject to explanation before a jury,is so fluctuating and so variously decided in the courts of the states. It is obvious,from the general tenor of the review, he is in favor of the rule as recognized in Edwardsv. Harden, and in the United States Court, in Hamilton v. Russel. He callsit the conservative principle, and one calculated to prevent frauds.*In Hamilton v. Russel, 1 Cranch s Rep. 309, the court held, that an absolute,unconditional sale of property, where the possession does not accompany and followthe deed, is fraudulent, and must be so determined by the court. Wolcott. Wilcox 9Conn. Rep. 134., is to the same effect. Story, J., in Conrad v. the Atlantic InsuranceCompany,! Peters Rep. 386., says, " without undertaking to suggest whether,in any case, the want of possession in the thing sold, constitutes, perse, a badge offraud, or is only prima facie a presumption of fraud, a question upon which a diversityof opinion has been expressed," avoiding the expression of an opinion onthe point. But in Bissel v. Hopkins, 3 Cowen s Rep. 166., Savage, Ch. J., held, itwas only presumptive evidence of fraud, and might be explained, and was a propersubject for the jury. And the same principle was recognized and established in Jacksonv. Zimmerman, 7 Wend. Rep. 436. In this case, Sutherland, J., observed, thatwhether fraudulent ornot, was in this, as in all otherwise, question of fact for the jury.There being no such thing as fraud in law as distinguished from fraud in fact. Whatwas formerly considered as fraud in law, or conclusive evidence of fraud, and to beso pronounced by the court, ia now prima facie evidence to be submitted to, andpassed upon, by the jury. The rule may therefore be considered as settled in New-york,contrary to the English cases, and that laid down in Hamilton v. Russel. Andthe rule is broken in upon in Tennessee, by the case Callen v. Thompson, 3 Yerger sRep. 475.OF TITLE TO SLAVES. 89having been declared by any public act whereby creditors couldtake warning that the slaves were only loaned.2.FITZHUGH et al. v.

The decree was appealed from.Per Cur. Tucker, J. The lapse of time between the loan (ifin fact it were a loan) of the slaves by the father to the son, beingnearly or quite twenty years, the period between the sale and thedeath of the father, the limitation is a complete bar in analogy tothe statute of limitations. Five years peaceable possession of aslave will operate as a bar to the recovery by the former owner,unless some express bargain or agreement be proved, showing thatthe possession of the holder is, in fact, in the possession of him whoclaims the property. If no such proof be adduced, the law construesthe property to be in him who hath the unqualified possessionfor such a length of time.3.HOOPER S ADM X v. HOOPER. Sept.

Where there are many persons liv-shallbe ing together, constituting one family, and there are slaves in thein 11 posses service of the family subject to the occasional orders of each mention.^ er O f j tj t h e possession in law should be considered and regardedas in those of the family who have the right to the property. In suchcase, if an infant be the real owner, and have title to a slave, theinfant should be regarded as in possession, although the fathercontrols the slave, and causes it to work as he pleases. So, also,if the title be not in the infant, but in another, who is bound tohold the title for the use of the infant ; then we are of opinion thepossession should still be considered with the infant, as cestui queuse, although the father directs and superintends the labor of theslave. If parents and adult children live together, and slaves waiton the family promiscuously, as they may be ordered, and thefather as the head of the family should superintend and direct themost important employment of the slaves, still possession shouldbe regarded as being with those of the family who have title.Where many persons are in the enjoyment of the use of property,be they adults, or infants in part, those who trust upon the faithof the property are bound to discriminate, and to ascertain, at theirperil, who has title among those using the property. When thetitle, whether it be legal or equitable, is found to be in one who,with others, seems to be enjoying the use in common, the possessionin law is fixed with that one having title, and his creditorsalone can reach the property.5.MIDDLETON v.

And in Echoes v.Derrick, 2 Stewart s Rep. 144., the court held, that where A. purchasedat sheriff s sale, without notice, a slave which had beenpreviously conveyed by deed in trust, but the deed not recorded inthe manner required by the statute of frauds, and after the sheriffs sale, and before the expiration of twelve months from the dateof the deed, the trustees sold the property, and executed the trust,the statute dispensing with the registry within twelve months, theadverse possession of A. under his purchase at the sheriff s sale,made no difference, and did not prevent the trustees from executinghis trust. And see Astor v. Wills, 4 Wheat. Rep. 466.best promoted to hold it evidence of fraud, where the property was not changed.But in qualified sales, mortgages, loans, <fec. of property, it seems to be necessary inthose complicated arrangements of which property is susceptible among families,that they should be open to explanation, and that the mere want of change of possessionshould not, per se, be evidence of fraud. And that is probably the true distinctionwhich might be drawn from the cases. It is the principle laid down in Hamiltonv. Russel, 1 Cranch s Rep. 309., and is sustained by a great number of cases, Englishand American. It is obvious, however, the rule does not apply where the propertyis BO situated it cannot be delivered. Conrad v. Atlantic Ins. Co., 1 Peter s Rep.386.; Basel v.

January T. 1830. 2 Stewart s Rep. 336.Trespass by Moore against the defendant, for taking away a ne Butitisforgro boy Torn. Ayres pleaded, that he levied on the boy as sheriff, * ^ e [the boy being: the property of one James B. Moore, by virtue of ther twasJ made toan execution against him. The plaintiff relied on a bill of sale to hinder orhim for the negro, by James B. Moore, in March, 1825, for the editors,consideration of $225, to be paid at Christmas; and which wasduly paid, and the bill of sale duly recorded. The sale took placeat the house of James B. Moore, when the slave was delivered byputting his hands into the hands of the purchaser, who afterwardswent home, leaving the slave in the possession of the vendor.About six weeks after the plaintiff took the boy home, but wentbackwards and forwards from the house of the purchaser and vendor,but was some time after, continually at the house of the purchaser.The defendant gave in evidence a mortgage of the boy,made after the sale to one Britain, who forcibly took the boy, andretained him near twelve months, until J. B. Moore satisfied thedebt, when the boy was returned, and again went into the possessionof William Moore.The counsel for the defendant requested the court to instructthe jury " that if they believed the possession did not accompanyand follow the bill of sale from J. B. Moore to the plaintiff,William Moore, at the time of its execution, that then the said billof sale was fraudulent in law, as against creditors and subsequentpurchasers." But the court refused, and charged them, " that ifthey believed that the consideration of the bill of sale was bonafide,and that it was duly recorded, it was good and valid in law, thoughthe negro remained in possession of the vendor previous to thattime."The Court, Lipscomb, Ch.

Br PRESCRIPTION.1.Brow v. JENKINS. April T. 1821. 9 Martin s LouisianaRep. 526.This suit is brought by the plaintiff, as heir to his mother, to Iras ] averecover a slave named Lazaree. The testimony on the part of the beplaintiff is, that he is the only child of Madame Brow ; that the scription,slave Lazaree belonged to her in the year 1803, when she resided f^iTtoat Jeremy, in the island of St. Domingo ; that she sent him to be examin -ed accord-charlestonin that year; that she died at Barca, about the end ing to theof 1808, or begining of 1809 ; that the plaintiff was born in 1792,or 1793, and was consequently 26 or 27 years old when thissuit was commenced. The testimony on the part of the acquired.defendant is, that Lazaree was in possession of Mr. Placide, inCharleston, about fourteen years before this suit was commenced,where he always remained, until sold to defendant; that Placidesold him to Astray on the 2Gth day of May, 1806, who possessedhim, as owner, until his death, in the summer of 1817, a term ofeleven years ; that he was in October, 1817, sold to Lazarus; thatLazarus sold him to defendant, on the 2d of August, 1819, inCharleston, South Carolina. The plaintiff arrived here in 1809.The negro Lazaree was brought here by the defendant, in the monthof August, 1819, and this suit was commenced the 15th September,in the same year. The defendant sets up the title of prescriptionby virtue of possession, in himself and others, under whom heclaims, founded on the several sales which were produced. Theprincipal question in this case was, by what law will the courtjudge of the prescription : that of South Carolina, where the slavewas, or that of this state, where the suit is brought.Porter, J. The presiding judge of this court has gone so fully96 SLAVERY.into the case, in the opinion which he has prepared, that I shallconfine my examination to what I consider the main question inthe cause, and that is, whether the statute of limitations of SouthCarolina has vested a title to the slave in the defendant. Thisinquiry, I think, will be best conducted, by pursuing the followingdivisions of the subject :1. Did the statute vest a title in South Carolina 12. Whether the owner of the property is bound by a law ofthis description, when it was proved that he did not reside in thecountry where it was enacted 13. Supposing the title to have been vested, in the state wherethe statute was in force, is there any thing in our laws which preventsthe defendant claiming the benefit of that title here ?I. The statute of South Carolina is an act of limitation, andfrom the perusal of it alone, it might be doubted whether it wasany thing more than a bar, which could be plead by the possessor,to an action in which the property was demanded. But it appearsthat judicial interpretation of the act has held, that it vests title ;and there is no doubt, from the decisions in thai state, that therethe person claiming slaves under the statute could recover themin the hands of another, as well as plead the act to an actioncommenced. 2 Bay s Rep. 156. 425.II. The next point, whether the plaintiff, not being a citizen, orresident of South Carolina, can lose his right to property by a lawof that country, is that which has presented the most difficulty tomy mind. If it had been shown in this cause, that both partieswere citizens of that state, I should have no doubt that both werebound by these laws, in virtue of which the one acquired, and theother lost a title to the property ; and that the right thus acquiredwould not be destroyed by the removal of one of the parties intoanother country.It is stated by Humerus, an eminent writer on the subject, thatwhoever makes a contract, in any particular place, is subject to thelaws of the place as a temporary citizen. 3 Dall. Rep. 370., in note.The rule is held to apply, where a contract is made in one country,to be executed in another, and the law of that where the agreementis to be performed, will form the rule of action for the parties.Now, although it has not been shown, that the plaintiff, or thoseunder whom he claims, ever were residents or citizens of SouthCarolina, or that they made any contract there, in relation to theproperty now sued for, yet enough, I think, has been proved toOF TITLE TO SLAVES. 97enable us to apply, safely and correctly, the principles of law juststated, to the case now before the court. For as the evidenceestablishes, that the slave in question, was sent by the plaintiff smother into South Carolina, under the care of an agent, this was avoluntary placing of her own property under these laws, to enjoytheir protection ; to take their advantages, if any in relation to it ;and consequently, to bear with their inconveniences.III. If the title set up here was by sale, donation, exchange, orany other contract made in South Carolina, we should hold it goodhere, if it was so in that state, and the only inquiry would be, did itvest title there 1 Prescription is a mode of acquiring property.Civil Code, 482., art. 32. ; Pother, Traite de la Prescription, chap.1. As strictly so as the cases of contracts just put. Digest, liv. 50.tit. 16. loi, 28. If in a common case of alienation, we hold it goodand valid, because the laws of the country where it was made heldit so, I cannot see any good reason to reject that of prescription ;for it vests and detests title, by the very same authority which declaresthat other species of contracts have that effect. In some ofour sister states it has been held, that in a suit for the recovery ofmoney, the law of limitation in the state where the suit is broughtmust govern the rights of the parties, and not that, where thecontract was made. There is a clear distinction, in my mind,between cases of that description, when the statute is pleaded as abar to the demand, and that now before the court, when it vests acomplete title to a specific thing ; for I have already stated, that Icannot distinguish between the title conferred by prescription, andthat acquired by any other mode of alienation and acquisition.When the question does occur here in a suit for money, it will bethen time enough to examine, whether the law of this state, as itregards the limitation of actions, or that where the parties contractedand hired, shall govern their rights ; or if the decisions on this subjectcan be reconciled with the principles of law, or supported bythe authorities on which they profess to rely. I am therefore ofopinion, that the judgment of the parish court be affirmed, with costs.Martin, J. I have carefully considered the opinion which JudgeMathews has prepared, and is about to read, and perfectly concurwith him.Mathews, J. This suit is brought to recover from the defendanta slave in his possession, claimed by the plaintiff, as sole heirto his mother, in whom he alleges title, at the time of her death.The defendant relies on a title derived through several persons resSLAVERy.siding in South Carolina, and on a right acquired by possessionand prescription. Judgment being for the defendant in the courtbelow, the plaintiff appealed. The evidence on the part of theappellants, which is entirely oral, establishes his heirship, as alleged,and shows that his mother had the slave in dispute while she residedin the islands of St. Domingo and Cuba, from which latter placeshe sent him to South Carolina. The acts of sale offered by theappellee to support his title were objected to by the counsel of theplaintiff, as not being sufficiently proven ; and bills of exceptionsregularly taken to the opinions of the judge of the court, a quo, bywhich they were allowed to be given in evidence. But from theinvestigation which I have given the cause, it is deemed unnecessaryto examine those exceptions ; as the testimony, received withoutopposition, clearly establishes an uninterrupted and peaceablepossession, of at least fifteen years duration, in the persons underwhom the defendant claims. Admitting that the evidence in thecase draws title in the ancestor of the appellant, and that the defendants claim rests solely on a title vested in those under whomhe holds the slave, acquired by prescription ; the first question tobe disposed of, as stated by the plaintiff s counsel, is, by what lawsmust the cause be decided, in relation to the title set up by theappellee ? Those of South Carolina, where the property was, orthose of this state, where the suit is commenced ? I am of opinion,that the validity of this title, by prescription, ought to be ascertainedand determined according to the laws of the former state.Were it to be settled by our laws on the subject, there would belittledifficulty in deciding the case, as they would not operate onthe slave in dispute, previous to his having been brought within thelimits of the state. And this did not happen, as is shown by therecord, until a month or two before the commencement of thepresent action. The law of South Carolina, on which the defendantrests his title, is a statute of limitations, prescribing the periodwithin which suits may be rightfully commenced in that state,having for their object and end, the same which is here sought bythe plaintiff. The period of limitation is there, four years for personspresent, and one more is allowed to those who are absent,making five for the latter, and by the lapse of this time their rightof action is barred. It is contended, on the part of the appellant,that this law must be considered as relating only to the remedy, orrelief grantable by the courts of justice, and not to the right ofproperty. In other words, that it is wexford, and not lex loci contractus;OF TITLE TO SLAVES. 99and that to the former species of laws, a foreign tribunal will giveno effect. So far as that relate to the recovery of debts, from thecases cited in support of this doctrine, little doubt can remain ofsuch being the practice adopted by the courts in several states ofthe union, and supported by the opinions of judges highly eminentfor talents and learning. Without admitting or denying the correctnessof these decisions, as founded in justice, policy, and aproper comity between the states, I think the case now under considerationmay be clearly distinguished from any which have beenexhibited to the court. The questions in them decided, turnedwholly on disputes about privileges, or a right to recover debts,barred by the laws of limitation which were in force, in the formerresidence of the contracting parties ; and such laws are basedsolely on a presumption of payment. In no instance was thereany contest relative to rights or title, vested in the possessor of property,as a necessary consequence resulting from a statute of limitations,which barred the claim of the owner. Whatever might bemy opinion as to the force and effect which ought to be given tothe laws of limitation of a foreign state, in relation to the recoveryof debts, I have no doubt they may become the means of acquiringtitle, when they operate so as to prevent the proprietor from recoveringhis property in consequence of an adverse possession.Possession of things is prima facie evidence of right and title tothem ; and if it has been of such duration, that the laws of thecountry where they are situated will not allow the possession to bedisquieted, I do not think it, by any means, a forced and unfairc instruction of law, to decide, that title, absolute and indefeasible,is gained by such possession. The owner, by neglecting to usethe remedy accorded to him, loses his right, which the bona fidepossessor acquires. It is perhaps true, that fraud on his part, orexcusable ignorance on the part of the proprietor, might require adifferent interpretation and application of the law of limitation.But in the present case, it cannot be pretended that either of themexisted. The evidence shows that good faith accompanied thepossession of the slaves in every change of master ; and that hewas sent by the plaintiff s mother to South Carolina ; so that shecould not be ignorant of the laws under which he was placed, andher means of redress against adverse possessors.This view of the subject places a law of limitation to an actionfor the recovery of property, on a footing with the usucapio of theRoman system of jurisprudence, viz. a mean of acquiring property ;100 SLAVERY.nor am I able to discover any incongruity in the principles onwhich these rules are founded. Usvcapio is defined in the Roman Digestto be adjective domini per continuation possessions } temporislege definite. It was introduced for the public good, that the titlesof property might not forever remain uncertain, after allowing sufficienttime to the owners to pursue their claims. D. 41. 3. 1.In the early periods of states, it maybe considered sound policy tomake the time for acquiring property by possession of short duration.By the ancient Roman law, as contained in an article of the TwelveTables, one year of possession was sufficient to save title to movables,and two toimmoveables, being what were termed res mancipii.In regard to incorporeal things, the Praetor had established a prescriptionof ten, and twenty years, or, as it is called, long temporis. Atfirst, under this prescription the possessor did not acquire the dominionof the thing, but only the benefit of an exception, or plea in bar,to any action brought by the proprietor. Afterwards, the actio utilisewas accorded to the possessor to recover the thing, when he hadlost the possession, pour revendiquer le chose, as expressed by pother.The distinction between res mancipii and nee mancipii, wasabolished by the emperor Justinian, and usucapio and prescriptionlong temporis put on the same footing ; this constitution, on thissubject, it is believed, forms the basis of the laws relating to prescriptionin those countries which have founded their jurisprudenceon the Roman law ; and, in all of them, it is considered a mode ofacquiring property. But it is seen, that even before this law ofJustinian, an action had been accorded to a possessor to recoverproperty of which he had lost possession ; and this could onlyhave been regular, on the principle that he had acquired title bysuch possession. Upon the whole, I am of opinion, that laws limitingthe time within which actions ought to be commenced for therecovery of property, may operate in such a manner as to vest atitle in a bona fide possessor, and that the law of South Carolinahas produced this effect in the present case. Judgment affirmed,with costs.2.DUNBAR v. NICHOLS. July T. 1S21. 10 Martin s LouisianaRep. 184.A partyeliwho relies Martin, J.

The law has provided defendants with the plea of prescription,that they may use it as a shield to protect themselvesagainst unjust claims, not to use it as a weapon to destroy justrights. The party who uses it in an unrighteous case, sins previously,and the court neither can or ought to supply the want ofit, ex officio. \Vhen the plea is not made, the presumption is, thatthe defendant thinks it would not avail him at all, and that he cannotrighteously avail himself of it. The district court, in my opinion,erred, in directing the jury to disregard the plaintiffs right, onthe ground that it was exercised too late, and I think the judgmentought to be reversed,Mathew, J.

We do so, by referring tothe third parthia, title twenty-nine, law twenty-four, in which wefind it provided, that if a man be free, no matter how long hemay be held by another, as a slave, his state or condition cannotbe thereby changed, nor can he be reduced to slavery, in any mannerwhatever, on account of the time he may have been held inservitude.

The plaintiff was there nonsuited,because he had not furnished proof that he brought suitwithin six months after he obtained the knowledge of the defect.The present record shows, that he fully removed this objection.Several grounds of defence have been presented in this courtagainst the right of the petitioner to recover. The last point isthat of prescription. On this head the counsel for the defendantreferred to several authors who have written on the French law.According to them, prescription is not interrupted by a suit inwhich the plaintiff s demand is rejected; nor where there is avoluntary abandonment of the action. Pandects Franchises, vol. 7.581, 582. Dunod, Traite de Prescription, 92. ; Denissart, vol. 3.740. It is unnecessary for us to go into the question, how the lawstands in that country, or to inquire how much of the doctrine onwhich the appellant relies, depends on provisions particular to theFrench jurisprudence. By that of Spain, greater facilities wereafforded the creditor to interrupt prescription. According to the3d parthia, title 29. law 29., a simple demand of the debtor, in thepresence of witnesses, was sufficient. Why an action in a court ofjustice, although not followed up to any final judgment, should nothave as much effect as a simple request, which is not succeeded bya suit, is not perceived by us. Admitting, however, that it has not,another provision of the law already cited, declares, that prescriptionis interrupted by a suit, and we find nothing in that law whichmakes any exception, or which goes to show that this interruption,which is declared to result from a demand in justice, loses effect,because the action is not prosecuted to final judgment. Prescription,says this law, ceases to run from the time suit is brought. Ofthis opinion must have been the compilers of our code, for intranscribing into it the provisions of the Code Napoleon, on theOF TITLE TO SLAVES. 103subject of prescription, they omitted inserting the article 2247,which declares, that if the plaintiff desist from his suit, or if his demandbe rejected, prescription will not be interrupted.5- The latterPETERS v.

METAYER. Jan. T. 1819. 6 Martin s LouisianaRep. 16.Derbigny, J., delivered the opinion of the court.The defendant, Adelaide Meaner, a woman of color, is in pos A slaver, . , c r who enjoy-sessionof her freedom, since a number of years. A person who ed hercalls himself her master, now sues to make her return to a state ofslavery. It was at first doubted, whether the plaintiff had proved turin s thehimself to be the same individual whom the witnesses call the only tion, mayson and heir of Charles Metayer of Cape Francois, who was the Time in es-masterof the defendant, when the revolution of Hispaniola broke Jer^iincout. But, after an attentive perusal of the record, it is now freedom bybelieved, that the plaintiff is sufficiently identified with Metayer s tion.son. The defendant pleads, in general terms, that she is free.She has failed in a former suit, where she was plaintiff in damagesfor false imprisonment, (Metayer v. Foret, 5 Martin s Rep. 566,)to prove her freedom by emancipation under her master s hand ;but the evidence in the present case shows that she was in Hispaniolawhen the general emancipation was proclaimed by thecommissioners of the French government, and remained there104 SLAVERY.until after the evacuation of the island by the French in 1 803, aperiod of about ten years. It is further proved, that she continuedin the enjoyment of her freedom, without interruption, until 1816 ;so that she has lived as a free person during twenty-three years ;that is to say, three years more than the time required by law foraslave to acquire his freedom by prescription, in the absence ofhis master. The plaintiff objects, that the time during which thedefendant remained in Hispaniola, ought not to be included in thiscalculation, because the abolition of slavery in that island was anact of violence, and that prescription does not run against thosewho have been so dispossessed, so long as they are prevented fromclaiming their property, according to the maxim, Contra nonvalence agere nulla currie descriptio. But the plaintiff cannotavail himself of this exception, without admitting, at the sametime, that the government of Hispaniola, during its divers revolutions,continued to countenance the general emancipation ; andthen, instead of the simple fact of possession, the right of the defendantto her freedom by law, would be the consequence ; for, if theabolition of slavery by the commissioners of the French republichas been maintained by the successive governments of the island,no foreign court will presume to pronounce that unlawful which,through a course of political events, has been sanctioned by thesupreme authority of the country. Therefore, without enteringinto this very delicate subject any farther than the present casemakes it strictly necessary, we are bound to say, at least, that, byvirtue of the general emancipation, the defendant enjoyed herfreedom in fact, no matter under what modification ; and that theyears which she passed at Cape Francois, in that situation, mustbe included in the time during which she did not live in a state ofslavery ; which time, at the lowest calculation, exceeds that whichis required by law for a slave to prescribe his freedom in the absenceof his master.

The onlyquestion at issue between the parties is, whether the plaintiff is afree person or a slave. Jean Pierre Stayed has intervened in thesuit ; but, as that intervention changes not the situation of the case,there is no necessity to notice it. It is admitted, on both sides,that the plaintiff once was the slave of Charles Metayer, the fatherof the person in whose behalf the defendant caused her to be arrested.But the plaintiff maintains that she has been enfranchisedby him. The evidence, however, which she has introduced insupport of that allegation, is of such a nature that it would be nugatoryto investigate it. One only circumstance deserves somenotice ; and that is, her enjoyment of her freedom during a numberof years. It is in evidence that the plaintiff, ever since sheleft Cape Francois, in 1803, has lived as a free person, first atBara^oa, in the Island of Cuba, and from the year 1809 at NewOrleans. A creditor of her late master caused her to be seizedin 1810, as the property of his debtor ; but a civil interruption ofpossession can take place only at the suit of the owner ; and thisinterruption by the owner did not happen until some time in theyear 1816 ; that is to say, after a possession of about thirteen years.By the laws of Spain, a slave can acquire his freedom by a possessionoften years, in the presence of his master, or of twenty yearsin his absence. It appears in this case, that during all the timethat the plaintiff enjoyed her freedom, the master was absentThus, according to the Spanish laws, the possession of the plaintifffalls far short of the time required to prescribe. It was doubtedwhether that disposition of the Spanish laws had not been repealedby the general provision introduced in our code, concerning theprescription of slaves. But, it is believed, that this article of ourcode is relative only to the acquisition of slaves by prescription,and cannot be construed to embrace the prescription of liberty bythemselves. We are, therefore, bound to say, that the plaintiffhas not succeeded to prove her freedom, and that she cannot recoverany damages for what she calls her unjust imprisonmentand detention.106 SLAVERY.8.ANDREWS v.

The bill was dismissed by the court below.for the Jdebts ofthe Per Cur. Green, J. It is proved by the complainants witnesses(his two sons,) that they were present in 1814 when theirfather lent the girl Tiller to their sister Mary. He told herto take the girl to nurse her child ; to take good care of her, andkeep her until he called for her. The girl went into the possessionof Walker, and so continued without interruption, until theseattachments were levied upon her, a period of fourteen years. Bythe act of 1801, ch. 25. sec. 2., the reservation of title by the complainant,as to the creditors of Walker, is fraudulent and void ;the loan not having been declared by deed, and the possessionhaving continued without interruption more than five years. Thethird section of this act does not affect the question. That onlyapplies as between the lender ancj borrower, and saves the rightof the former to reclaim and recover the property loaned. Thetitle of this negro must, therefore, be regarded, as to these defendants,with the possession. It is not necessary here to decide,whether a gift by parol, of personal property, to the seperate useof a married woman, would be good. This is the ordinary caseof a loan to the married daughter, reserving the title in himself.Walker was the possessor of the negro, and no matter what theparties may have intended, or how notorious the complainant sclaim of property may have been, the statute is peremptory, anddeclares that as to creditors the title shall be considered with thepossession.

One called by theplaintiff declared that the negro had been afflicted with the diarrhoea,some time previous to the period when the defendant purchasedhim ; that the physician who attended him had reported him wellandthat he had quite a healthy appearance when sold. That sectionof the civil code which treats of the defects in the thing sold, and red-historyvices, is by no means the most clear and satisfactory of thatwork; and since its enactment, several embarrassing questions arisingout of its provisions, have been presented for decision. It is now,however, the settled doctrine in this court, that by the term " diseaseincurable in its nature," must be understood any disease ofwhich the slave is afflicted at the time of the sale, that has progressedso far as to be incurable. Our only inquiry, then, is, dothe facts, as proved in evidence, bring this case within the rule 1The testimony already detailed, appears to us to show beyonddoubt, that the negro was diseased OH the day of the sale. Theevidence of the physicians satisfies us that it was of that disease hedied. Whether it had progressed so far as to be rendered incurable,is the main, and, indeed, the only difficulty which the case pre *sent. The fact is not placed beyond all doubt by the testimony,nor can human testimony ever establish, beyond doubt, at what perioda disease is incurable, unless the persons who give it areacquainted with all the means of cure which human knowledgepossesses. We, however, have it in evidence here, that the slavesunk under the disease, and it is such as is generally incurable.This we think sufficient to throw the burthen of proof on the otherside, and the defendant, aware that it did, has labored to show, thatthe fact of the disease being incurable, clearly resulted from the testimony.But in this he has completely failed. The evidence, so farfrom establishing the suitableness of the disease, is entirely silent inregard to it. To supply the place of proof, the defendant has resortedto conjecture, and has contended, that we do not know butthat if a physician had been called in earlier, the life of the slavemight have been saved. We do not know what effect an earlierapplication to medical aid might have had, and for that very reasonwe cannot give the plaintiff the benefit of a fact which he hasnever proved. In the case of St. Rome v. Pore, the same argumentwas resorted to, and was considered of no weight. Theour there held, that it lay on the vendor to show that the diseaseof which the slave died might, under a different course of treatment,have been cured. 10 Martin s Rep. 215. Every thing in this caserebus the presumption that the disease would have yielded to medioWARRANTY. 109cine, nor do we see that there was such negligence on the part ofthe vendee as to deprive him of what we conceive a just and conscientiousdefence. As was said in the case just cited, physiciansare frequently not resorted to until family medicines fail. Theright of purchasers to resist the payment of an object which turnsout to be of no value, should not be made to depend on their medicalskill ; on their knowledge that a disease on its first appearanceis a dangerous one ; and that recourse must be instantly had toprofessional men. That of which the slave died we know to beone that is slow in its progress, and not apt, in its incipient stages,to excite much alarm. The jury have found that the negro was,at the time of sale, afflicted with an acute dysentery. We seenothing in the evidence to support the conclusion. Taking it tobe correct, it would not affect the decision of the case. Judgmentaffirmed.2.THOMPSON v. Tilbury. Aug. T. 1823. 13 Martin s LouisianaRep. 468.Per Cur. Porter, J.

This action was commenced to obtaintoobtamre- rec i s ; on o f the sale of a negro slave, called La Fortune, sold as athe sale of carpenter and joiner, for the price of $1500. It is alleged thatcommon he is neither; and in addition, is afflicted with redhibitory defectslex ninths f disposition, a drunkard, run-away, and thief. Prescription andfrom the a general denial are plead by the defendant. The district courtcohering 18 gave judgment against the plaintiff, and he has appealed. Thethe phitntfff first question to be examined, is that which the exception, as to themust prove t ^ me o f commencing the action, presents. The slave was sold ontime he ob the 3d, April, 1819. This suit was commenced on the 14th Feb-knowd ie a edge ruary, 1820. The plaintiff replied to the plea of prescriptionof the red j d by the defendant ; that he brought his action within sixhistory J cvices. months from the discovery of the vices and defects complained orinthe petition. It has been strongly contested by the parties inthis cause, on whom the burthen of proof lies, the plaintiff insistingthat he cannot be required to prove a negative, viz. that he didnot know of the existence of the defect anterior to a particulartime ; while the defendant urges, that th u plea of the appellant isan exception to the general rule, which requires the action to bebrought within six months from the date of the sale, and that he whorelies on an exception must establish it. Parthia, 3 tit. 14. L. 2. Ihave given to this subject a great deal of consideration, and my opinionis with the defendant. By our Civil Code, 358. art. 75. it is sufficientfor the seller of a slave afflicted with redhibitory defects, tooppose the action, that it has not been commenced within sixmonths from the sale. And on showing this fact, the plaintiff willbe barred, unless he does away the objection, by replying that hedid not discover the vices or defects six months before institutingsuit. As he makes the averment, 1 think it his duty to prove it.Certainly, I do not wish to say that the buyer must give evidencethat he did not know of the defect before a certain time, becausethat would be requiring him to prove a negative, which is impossible.But I think he should establish, when the facts came to hisknowledge, on which he relies to show his right of setting asidethe sale. And this he can do without difficulty ; for the witnesseswho prove the vices on the trial, can easily state when they communicatedthem to the plaintiff . If he has received the knowledgeOF WARRANTY. Illof what the witnesses knew, and would swear through othersources, he could bring forward those who gave him this information.The moment he does this, he brings himself within the exception; and if the vendor still insists the purchaser knew of thevice at an earlier period, the burthen of proof is then thrown onhim ; for the buyer can do nothing more than show affirmatively,that at a certain epoch he became acquainted with the fact ; hecannot prove a negative, that he did not know it sooner. The passagecited by the plaintiff from the Curia Phillips, Redhibitoria,n. 26. is certainly very strong; but I cannot, alone on that authority,bring my mind to assent to the proposition, that it is the duty ofthe defendant to support by proof, what it behoves the plaintiff toallege.If, in this case, the plaintiff had proved any circumstance, withinsix months, respecting the theft, 1 should have held it sufficientto have thrown the burthen of proof on the defendant, as to hisknowing it sooner. But on this point the testimony is entirely defective.The slave was bought in April. There is evidence whenthe master returned to the Atakapas, but none as to the time theslave was sent there ; of course, we have no means of ascertainingwhen he committed the theft, proved by one of the witnesses. Allwe know is, that it was after he reached his master s plantation.In regard to the defect of the qualities of carpenter and joiner, theplaintiff has proved enough to show that this action was commencedwithin the time required by law. But on the merits, the evidenceis so contradictory, that I do not feel myself authorised tocome to a different conclusion in regard to it from the districtjudge. The judgment of the district court should be reversed, and,in my opinion, the justice of the case requires that there should bejudgment for the defendant, as in case of a nonsuit, and that theplaintiff pay costs in both courts.Martin, J. I cannot yield to the opinion of the author of the CuriaPhilippics. The authorities which he cites do not support his conclusion.The defendant pleaded prescription, and the question is, whois to administer the proof of the period at which the knowledge of theredhibitory defects reached the vendee ? I think we ought to requirefrom the party who can give it. If he allege that he had itnot at the time of sale, as it is clear that he had it at the time ofthe inception of the suit, it cannot be difficult for him, at least, tostate at what intermediate period, and by what means the knowledgecame to him. If he establishes any particular period Stabit112 SLAVERY.presumption donee contraries probetur. If the adverse party does notshow knowledge at an earlier period, the prescription will besupported. This repels the plaintiff s claim on the score of theslave being a thief; as to the other grounds, I think the evidenceis too weak.Mathews, J. I am of the same opinion. Judgment reversed.4.Reynard & Suck v. Guillotine & BOISFOXTAINE. May T.1823. 13 Martin s Rep. 227.Prescriptive J. The petition sets forth on the 24th Feb. 1821, thehibUor/ac- defendant sold to the plaintiff a negro boy named Tommy, aboutfrom r the S 23 ? ears old > for the sum of # 900 and warranted him freetimethede- from all redhibitory vices and diseases. That at the time of theslave are sale the slave was afflicted with ulcers on his leg, and that the despendants knew it, but made false representations respecting hishealth ; that the said ulcers are of an old standing, and that notwithstandingall the care, trouble, and expense which the petitionershave been put to, the slave is almost entirely unfit for the workand labor for which he was destined : and finally, that the use ofsaid slave is rendered so inconvenient for them, that had they beeninformed of his true situation, they would not have bought him.The answer avers, that the negro at the time of the sale was notafflicted with ulcers ; that if he was, the sale cannot be rescinded ;and that owing to the want of care in the plaintiffs, the slave hasbeen injured in value to the amount of $500. With leave of thecourt, the plea of prescription was afterwards added.The first question to be decided, is the plea of prescription. Theaction was commenced nine months and twenty-four days afterthe date of the sale. It is the duty of the buyer, who brings thisaction after six months have elapsed, to prove when the knowledgeof the defects of the slave was acquired by him. A question arisesout of the evidence in this case, whether the prescription runs fromthe time the disease was known to exist, or from the time it wasascertained to be such as would form the ground of redhibition.We think from the latter ; for until the purchaser was instructedthat, he had a right of action, he was not in delay by not bringingit. He cannot be accused of negligence while the nature of thedisease was unknown to him, and he was conferring a benefit onthe vendor by attempting to cure it. In the case of Heard v.Chretien, we said, that if the plaintiff had proved any circumstancerespecting the time when he acquired a knowledge of the vice, weOF WARRANTY. 113should have held it sufficient to throw the burthen of proof on theseller, to show that he knew it earlier. In that now before us, itis proved by one of the witnesses, that the plaintiff did not seemaware that the disease was incurable in the month of October ; andup to the 31st July, the negro was not prevented by sickness fromworking. So that whether we take as the basis of this action theslave being afflicted with an incurable disease, or having one, whichthough not incurable, was known to the vendor at the time of the sale,and rendered his services so difficult and interrupted, that if thepurchaser had been aware of its existence, he would not have madethe acquisition. The plea of prescription must be rejected.5.MOORE S ASSIGNEE v. KING et al. Aug. T. 1822. 12 Martins Louisiana Rep. 261.Per Cur. Martin, J. The plaintiff sues on an obligation of The ventredefendants, assigned him by King.

Whether ths woman had not before, and atth?- time of tha sale, a pendulous wen, on the inside of one of herthigh?, which, at tims, prevented h3r rendering any service atall ; and whether this circumstance was disclosed at the time ofthe sale 1 The assignor admitted, that she received the defendants obligation as the price of a negro woman sold him, and assignedit to the plaintiff; that the woman had, at the time of thesale, a mark on the inside of one of her thighs, which did not injureher, nor prevent her services at any time while she wasowned by her ; hence this circumstance was not disclosed to thevendee, that she did not know of any pendulous wen, as stated inthe answer; but only of the aforesaid. mark, which, however, shenever examined.Tha jury found, that the sum mentioned in the obligation wasthe price of the negro woman named in the answer, who had apendulous wen, as there stated, which rendered her, at times, incapableof labor ; a circumstance which was not disclosed at, orprevious to the sale, and that consequently, the plaintiff ought tosuffer a diminution of $150 from the price. The plaintiff had114 SLAVERY.judgment accordingly, and appealed. Dr. Elmer deposed, thatabout eighteen months after the sale he examined the woman, andfound she had a pendulous wen, of the size of a duck s egg, attachedby a short neck to the inside of her thigh, near the leftlabia pudenda. It was said, she was laid up in consequence ofan injury the wen had received while she was crossing a fence. Itwas wounded and ulcerated ; she was relieved. He thinks thewen must have been of ancient origin, as wens do not reach thesize of this in less than one or two years. The woman must havehad it from her infancy. From its appearance, when the witnesssaw it, it must have laid up the woman from eight to ten days, andthe expense of her cure could not exceed ten dollars. It mustever be subject to injury, and must incommode her in walking.The witness thinks it ought to be amputated, which would not beattended with danger, would confine her for fifteen or twenty days,and would cost about thirty dollars. Were not the witness a surgeon,he would not have given half of the price for her, on accountof the wen ; and as a surgeon, he thinks he would estimate thediminution in the price, occasioned by it, at $100. Dr. Dixonhaving heard Dr. Elmer give his evidence, deposed, his opinionwas perfectly the same, except that, as an individual, he wouldthink the diminution of the value of the slave, occasioned by theexistence of the wen, at two hundred dollars.Marshall, the defendant s overseer, deposed, that the slave wassmart and active. She was sick once or twice with the fever.He never discovered that she limped. The plaintiff s counsel contends,that as it is not proved that the vendor had any knowledgeof the existence of the wen, no diminution of the price ought tohave to have been made. Civil Code 360. art. 80. The ignoranceof the vendor protects him, indeed, against redhibitory action; but it is that action alone of which the code speaks,in the part quoted. This ignorance will not avail in the actionquanti minoris. " If the seller was ignorant of the defect, then thebuyer must keep the slave, and the seller restore so much of theprice as the value is diminished by reason of the defect ;" and so,we say, if the slave was afflicted with any hidden disease. Part 5,3. 64. Judgment affirmed.OF WARRANTY. 1156.ST. Remus v. PORE. May T. 1821. 10 Martin s LouisianaRep. 30.Martin, J. This is an action for the recision of the sale of a if t h e dis-negrowoman, on the ground that she was attacked with the maladyof which she died soon after the sale, previous, and at the time its origin,of the contract. The defence is, that the defendant, finding that ble at "thethe woman was sick, had her sold at auction, on the 2d of May, * e e t ^ hewhen she was struck to the plaintiff. That soon after the plaintiff case is aredhidiloryinformed him he would not take the woman, as she was sick ; to one.which the defendant replied, he thought he was bound to take her,as she had, according to the defendant s orders, been sold, with theonly warranty of the redhibitory diseases ; that on the 9th theplaintiff informed him he would accept the sale, and the defendantexecuted the bill of sale for her to the plaintiff before a notarypublic. There was judgment for the plaintiff, and the defendantappealed. The defendant, by interrogatories, drew the followingfacts from the plaintiff : The plaintiff after the auction, and beforethe execution of the sale before the notary, told the defendant hewould not take the wench, as he had discovered that she was sick.To which the defendant replied, he did not know whether she was ;but that, at all events, he meant to sell, and had actually sold heras he had bought her, i. e. with a warranty of all redhibitory diseases.To the best of the plaintiff s recollection, of the correctnessof which he declared himself sure, the defendant did not say,that unless the plaintiff could prove that the woman s disease was aredhibitory one, he could not help taking her, as those only werewarranted against. Some days after, and in consequence of thedefendant s declarations, the parties met at the notary s office, andexecuted the act of sale. The statement of facts shows, that Dr.Dow deposed, that he was called upon to see the woman, just afterthe defendant bought her, and recognized her as a patient whomhe had visited at her former mistress s seven months before ; atthat time she labored under an intermittent fever, occasioned by asuppression of the menstrual discharge ; he ordered the ordinaryremedies : wine, bark, and a generous diet, with exercise. Whenhe saw her at the defendant s he found her weak, her legs swollen,and told him a generous diet and proper medicines would effecther cure. And as he did not consider her as incurable, and asas she was a valuable servant, he advised him to have her wellattended. He has not seen her since. Dr. Dupuy said he was116 SLAVERY.called upon by the plaintiff, to the woman ; she appeared verysick, and he supposed her incurable. He attended her from the17th of May, 1818, rill the 13th June, when she died. On thesecond day of his attendance, she was in a state of completemadame, with all the symptoms of a chronic disease, in its laststage ; her legs swollen. He attended her carefully, but, as hehad supposed, to no purpose. The disease he believes was ofseven or eight months standing, and quite incurable when he sawher. Miguel, the plaintiff s brother-in-law, deposed, he knew thewoman, who had before been his property. The defendant appliedto him before he bought her, and he told him i-hr 1 was a good servant.He did not know her to be sick before she died at hishouse on the 13th of June ; the plaintiff having put her there.It is contended, that the plaintiff cannot recover, as the sicknessof the slave was known to him at the time of the execution of theact of sale. It is not easy to conclude, from the evidence in thecase, that he knew the disease was an incurable one ; and he had theplaintiff s assurance, that if it was a redhibitory one, it was warrantedagainst; so that our sole inquiry is, was the disease a prohibitoryone 1 Ailments o^ infirmities constitute redhibitory defects,when they are incurable by their nature. So that the slave subjectthereto, is absolutely unfit for the services for which he is destined ;or these services are so inconvenient, difficult, and interrupted,that it is to be presumed the buyer would not have bought her atall, if he had been acquainted with the defect ; or that he wouldnot have given so high a price, had he known that such a slavewas subject to that sickness, or infirmity. Civ. Code. 358. art. 80.I understand this to mean, if the buyer knows the nature of thedisease, i. e. that it is incurable. In the present case, the diseaseexisted before the sale, and though curable in its origin, had nowbecome incurable. This certainly was not known to the plaintiff;for who can believe, that if it was, he would have bought 1 Heknew the slave to be sick, informed the vendor of it, and receivedfor answer, that she was sold with a warranty of redhibitory diseases; among these, the law has classed incurable ones, such as thatunder which the slave labored. It appears to me, the partiescontemplated that the vendee s claim would depend on the issueof the disease. I think we ought to affirm the judgment of theparish court.Mathews, J.

The answer incurable,- or, thatto the question could not, in any respect, contradict the act, not withouteven its date ; for ncn constat, whether the date was affixed when that, hethe instrument was drawn out, or at the time it became a public ^"^ th e fact by the signatures of the parties. the slave sThe object, declared in the bill of exceptions of putting thisquestion, was to show that the plaintiff had the slave in possession,and was acquainted with him before he signed the bill of sale.The appellee urges, that if this were the object, it could not have,in any respect, weakened his case, or strengthened his adversary s,supposing the witness to have answered as the party calling expected.Because, whether the plaintiff knew of the fact or not,at the time of the purchase, he is still protected under the warranty.To this objection it has been answered, that the disease of whichthe slave died, was one of those which the law classes as an absolutevice of body ; that consequently, the action can only be maintainedunder the 2496th article of the code, which confers it on thebuyer, when the thing bought is either absolutely useless, or itsuse is so inconvenient and imperfect, that it must be supposed thebuyer would not have purchased it, had he known of the vice ; andthat if the answer to the interrogatory would have induced the beliefof the purchaser having a knowledge of the disease at the timehe bought, then it was material it should be answered, because thepresumption of ignorance, on which the law gives an action, wouldbe destroyed. This argument has also been supported, by referenceto the 2497th article of the code, which declares, that apparentobjects, such as the buyer might have discerned by simple inspection,are not among the number of redhibitory vices. Knowledgethat a slave was diseased at the time of the sale, and a knowledgethat he was afflicted with an incurable disease, are two distinctthings, and their effects on the right of the parties quite dissimilar.118 SLAVERY.It is almost incredible, that any person in his senses would buyproperty of this kind, and giVe a full price for it, unless he conceivedhe was protected by the warranty, and even then it is difficultto conceive any object in such a contract. If, indeed, as wassaid in the case of St. Homes and Pore, it appeared clearly, thatthe purchaser knew the nature and extent of the disease, and consentedto purchase under all risks, the action of redhibition couldnot, perhaps, be maintained. But when the evidence is in theleast degree equivocal, the presumption would be, that where afull price was given, the purchaser conceived the disease was otherthan incurable ; one that would yield to medicine. It is establishedin the present instance, that the slave died of an abscess in hislungs. When the physician was first called in, which was sevenor eight days after the date of the bill of sale, the negro was foundto be afflicted with a cough, and difficulty of breathing. Thiscough existed at the time the contract was made, for it is in evidencethat the defendant, when questioned in relation to it by theplaintiff, said, it was the remains of dysentery. Now, supposingthe witness had established the fact of the plaintiff s having theslave in his possession some time before he signed the note, we donot see how it could have aided his defence. The presumptionflowing from it would only have confirmed a fact proved byother testimony, and in relation to which there does not appear tohave been any dispute ; namely, that the plaintiff knew at the timehe purchased the slave he was afflicted with a cough. We areclear this knowledge did not defeat his recourse in warranty, forthere must not only be knowledge of a disease, but knowledge ofone that is incurable, and of such a nature as to render the slaveuseless, or his use so inconvenient and imperfect, that the buyerbought under the hope or chance he might recover. 10 Martin sRep. 220. Although, therefore, the judge might very properlyhave admitted the evidence, we do not see any possible influenceit could have had in the cause which would authorize us to remandit for a new trial. Judgment affirmed.8.BROWNSTON v. CROPPER.

Itappeared that the slave told Brownston at the time of the sale, thatshe was mortally sick, and could be of no service to him. Thecourt held, that where the seller of a slave, represented her to bein good health, notwithstanding the slave should state her truesituation, it would not be notice to him so as to discharge the sellerfrom his responsibility for the misrepresentation, there being astrong indisposition in slaves to be sold, and they by stratagem toavoid a sale, may frequently feign sickness, and the purchaser maywell disbelieve them, and rely on the word of the seller. Theconstitutional court of South Carolina decided directly the reverse.They held that in an action for a breach of warranty of soundness,the declarations of the slave in relation to the disease wereadmissible. 1 Harper s Rep. 39.9.SMITH v.

And Rowzee sued Bishop for theprice agreed upon at the time of the sale. Verdict for the plaintiff.The defendant appealed.Per Cur. Mills, J. The plaintiff was no doubt acquaintedwith the debilitated state of the slave when he sold her. She hadjust recovered from a fit of sickness, and the plaintiff sent her tothe house of the defendant veiled, to conceal the loss of part of herhair by fever. He said nothing about her sick or dangerous state.If he concealed these things, he was guilty of concealing the truth,which absolved the appellant from all obligations to pay for her, or120 SLAVERY.if he gave a coloring to the facts relative to her condition, he wasguilty of a misrepresentation.* Judgment reversed.10.EXECUTORS OF HART v.

The Louisiana code, art. 2498., providesthat the vendee cannot urge redhibitory vices which were madeknown to him by the vendor, at or before the time of sale ; andauthorizes parol evidence of these declarations.But we are compelled to say, that no declarations made by astranger can have the same effect. The conversation of by-sanderswith either of the defendants were, in the opinion of the court, improperlyadmitted to exclude the legal warranty relied on, and thebenefit of which is claimed by the defendants, unless they tended toestablish the fact that the redhibitory vices complained of, had beendeclared by the vendor to the defendants.

Two days after, he sent the messenger, who returnedwith the slave, who was sick and unable to walk, and diedat his house within three weeks after. The court instructed thejury, " that it was the duty of the plaintiff, now appellant, to haveused due diligence in discovering any defect which might belongto the negro." Verdict for defendantPer Cur. That every person purchasing an article or commodity,which may be defective, may be bound to espy out any visibledefect, easy to be discovered, when the article is examined, andthat the seller may not be responsible for such defects, will not becontested. But even then, if the seller uses any artifice, or disguisessuch defects, or misrepresents them, or by false statementsinduces the purchaser to waive the defect, and make the purchase,the defect notwithstanding, the seller may be made responsible.But the phthisic or asthma is not a disease of that palpable character,that a person is bound to notice it, certainly not the stagethe disease has progressed. If the seller misrepresented even theviolence of the disease, so as to induce the purchaser to buy, heis responsible. Judgment reversed.15.Galbraith v. White. April T. 1797.

Thatif plaintiff, had sold said slave, which appeared from the evidence,he could not recover from the defendant, unless a recovery hadbeen had against him. But the court overruled the motion, andcharged the jury expressly, that if they found by the evidence, thatthe slave in question was worthless, and had at the time of the salethe disease of which she died, that the measure of damages shouldbe the sum paid for the negro by Camp, without saying any thingabout interest, leaving that matter entirely discretionary with thejury. To which opinion the counsel excepts, &c.The only question raised by the assignment of errors, is as tothe measure of damages. The general rule upon this subjectcannot be mistaken. In trover, it would be the value of the propertyat the time of conversion ; but according to better and laterdecisions, the rule has been extended. As for instance, in troverfor money in a bag, the measure of damages would be the amountof the sum, with interest, from the time of conversion. So, in asimilar action for a slave, the jury would be instructed to givethe value of property at the time of conversion, with its yearlyvalue from the same period, up to the rendition of the judgment ofthe court. See the case of Thomas Hinds v. William Terry, referredfrom Jefferson county, where these principles are clearlyestablished. 14 Johns. Rep. 122. In the case before us, TexadaOF WARRANTY. 125sold a negro to Camp for $475, and on the 29th of September,1821, warranted her to be sound in body and mind. Accordingto the finding of the jury, she was worthless, and unsound, on theday of warranty, and I think the judge instructed the jury correctly,and might with propriety have gone further, and charged them tohave found a full verdict, with interest from the day of the date ofthe warranty, as I am fully persuaded the defence sought to bemaintained by the defendant, cannot be supported by the rules andprinciples of the law.Will the vices and illegalities of a contract between Camp andWhite, be a matter of good defence by Texada in the present case,on a seperate and distinct contract 1 I presume not. As if A.receives money to the use of B. on an illegal contract betweenB. and C., he shall not be allowed to set up the illegality of thecontract, as a defence in an action brought against him for themoney of B. See the case of Levant v. Elliott, in 1 Bos. &Pull. So, in this case, Texada shall not be allowed to set up theillegal contract of Camp and White, as a matter of defence beforethe court and jury, because he has received a full price forhis negro upon the warranty ; and by that alone he must be answerable,it being the contract upon which this action is founded.I will not deny but that Camp will be liable to White, wheneverhe may think proper to establish his claim, but that a party to asuit at law, can travel out of the express terms of his contract, bywhich his liability has been created, when the jury have said theproperty warranted was not worth one cent, is claiming too greatan indulgence at the hands of the court.

The question which this case presents is, ^ n a b slavewhether the buyer of a slave afflicted with a disease which was claimed arecurable in its nature, and cured, has an action on reduction of the as kosTforprice. The services of the slave were lost to the purchaser for wh ! ch th( l. recision ofabout sixty days. The court below thought he has not, and gave the salejudgment for the defendant. The plaintiff appealed. The judge,126 SLAVERY.iunder the 2522d article of the Louisiana Code, assimilated the claimfor a reduction in the price to the action for exhibition, andconcluded that, as in the latter action, the contract could not be setaside, unless the slave was afflicted with some vice or defect whichrendered him absolutely useless, or his use so inconvenient orimperfect that it must be supposed the buyer would not havepurchased him had he known of his imperfections ; the plaintiffcould not demand any reduction for a defect which did not fallwithin either of the causes that furnish ground for redhibition.We think the judge did not err. The article 2522, in our opinion,places the causes for the reduction of price on the same groundas those of redhibition, and we are unable to say, from a considerationof the proof offered in this instance, that had the plaintiff beeninformed of the disease under which the slave labored, he wouldnot have purchased him.

The court unless thegave judgment for the reduction of price, and the defendant is absolute-perCur. Mathews, J. In support of the plaintiff s right to ob ty of courtsto make atain judgment, his counsel relies on the art. 2496 of the Louisiana fair deduced,and a decision found in 8 Martin s Rep. 313. That decisionwas made under an article in the old code similar to that cited not idthe sale.from the new. It appears to be difficult to reduce the doctrine ofredhibition to any precise and explicit rules, calculated to answerthe ends of justice in every case which may arise. Questionsrelating to redhibitory vices and defects in things sold, must besolved principally in relation to the peculiar facts and circumstancesof each particular case. With regard to the bodily defectsand vices of slaves, our law divides them into two classes : onedenominated absolute, and the other relative. The former in allcases afford a legal ground of redhibition ; the latter may also furnisha good cause for an entire recision of the contract of sale, or areduction of price, according to the facts of each particular case.In the present suit, there is no evidence that shows the disease ofthe slave alleged to be defective, to be of the class defined as absolute.A physician, the only witness examined in relation to it, whowas called by the vendee, declares his opinion, that it is not incurable; but that from its nature, so long as it endures, interruptions*o the services of the slave afflicted, would be a necessary consequence; that it appeared to him, to have been of considerableduration ; and from this circumstance, difficult of cure. He concludesthe slave in question to be worth one third less in consequenceof the diseased state, than she would be if sound. Thedisease appears to be an enlargement of the veins in one of her legs.On this testimony we are obliged to determine, whether or notthe disease proven, constitutes a redhibitory defect.The article of the code cited, (2496) defines " redhibition to betheavoidance of sale, on account of some vice or defect in thething sold, which renders it either absolutely useless, or its use soinconvenient and imperfect that it must be supposed the buyerwould not have purchased it had he known of the vice." The article2497 declares, that " apparent defects, that is, such as thebuyer might have discovered by simple inspection, are not amongthe number of redhibitory vices." The true meaning of this articleis not very perspicuous : that is, whether the defect should be130 SLAVERY.open and apparent to the buyer by a view of the object offered forsale in the manner which it is exhibited to his sight, or whether heis not bound to inspect and examine it with the care and cautionordinarily used by prudent men on such occasions.It is, however, unnecessary to give any interpretations to it inthe present case, in consequence of the conclusion to which thearticle 2501 necessarily leads us. There is a clause in this article,which we believe did not exist in the old code, that seems to control,in a great degree, that part of the article (2496) relative tothe inconvenience and imperfection of the use of things purchased.After the distinction of bodily defects or vices in slaves into absoluteand relative, it is declared, that the former are those of whichthe bare existence give rise to the redhibitory action. But " relativevices are those which give rise to it, only in proportion to thedegree in which they disable the object sold." From this we conclude,that unless the object sold be absolutely useless, it is ratherthe duty of courts of justice to make a fair deduction from theprice, than entirely to avoid the sale, especially, when the realvalue of the thing bears any reasonable proportion to the priceagreed upon. The diminution of value, in consequence of the diseaseof the slave, in the present instance, is estimated by thedefendant s witness at one third less than the price stipulated ;and we perceive nothing, in the whole testimony of the cause,which requires our interference, in relation to the conclusion ofthe court below, on the relative value of the two slaves purchasedby the defendant.24.M Parlance v.

Fall T. 1812. 2 Bibb s Rep. 616.The appellee sold to the appellant, a negro boy, evidenced by Wherewriting, in these words : " Rec of Wm. Smith, of Lexington,$300 for a negro boy named Abram, which negro is sound andhealthy, and I warrant the title of said boy against the claim or verredthatthe defend-claimsof every person whatever, as witness my hand this 26th of antfcwewofMarch, 1810." The appellant moved the court to instruct the soundness.jury, that if they were of opinion that the defendant sold the negroin the declaration mentioned to the appellant, with a warrantyof his soundness, that the negro, at the time of the sale and warranty,was unsound, and of which unsoundness he afterwards died, thatthe appellant had a right to recover such damages as they shouldthink he was entitled to from the evidence. The court refused togive the instruction, and the appellant appealed.Per Cur. Owsly, J. This bill of sale, which affirms that the negrois sound, does not amount to an express warranty of soundness.That the appellee did not intend to warrant the negro sound, wethink evident from the writing. It contains an acknowledgmentof the receipt of the money for which the negro was sold ; a representationthat he was sound, and an express warranty of title.Had the appellee intended to warrant the negro sound, it is mostreasonable to suppose the warranty would have been so wordedas to embrace it. Where there is no express warranty, but onlyan affirmation of soundness at the time of sale, in an action for afalse affirmation, the declaration should charge that the vendorknew the article was unsound. Here there is no such averment ;and having declared on the warranty of soundness, when there isnone, the judgment of the circuit court must be affirmed.SLAVERY.26.LEWIS v. COOPER. Feb.

April T. 1829. 19 Martin sLouisiana Rep. 678.Per Cur. This is an action of redhibition to annul the sale of DrankeH-a slave, and recover part of the price for her, and to be monumental notrated from the payment of the balance due. The general issue aJtect/andwas pleaded in the court of the first instance, and the defendant s is not . a .ground ofvendor cited in warranty. The cause was submitted to a jury redhibi-who found for the plaintiff. Judgment was rendered on this verdictagainst the defendant, and in his favor against Shift, fromwhom he had purchased. From this judgment, both the defendantsand the party called in warranty, have appealed. The vice,to which the slave is charged in the petition to be subject, is habitualdrunkenness. The evidence establishes satisfactorily theallegation. The only question, therefore, presented for our decision,is, whether the defect be such a one as authorizes the purchaserof a slave to it, to have the sale rescinded.The purchase was made since the enactment of the late amendmentsto our code, and must be governed by them. The 2496tharticle of that work defines redhibition to be, " t the avoidance ofa sale on account of some vice or defect in the thing sold, whichrenders it either absolutely useless, or its use so inconvenient andimperfect, that it must be supposed the buyer would not have purchasedit had he known of the vice."The 2500th article divides the defects of slaves into two classes:vices of body, and vices of character. In the 2502d, some ofthe vices of the body are defined, and others are stated to be containedin the 2496th article, which we have already cited. Butwith regard to those of character, the next article expressly declares,that they are confined to cases where the slave has committeda capital crime, where he is convicted of theft, and where heis in the habit of running away. No reference is made, as in thearticle relating to their bodily defects, to the previous provisionwhich mak es any disease a cause of redhibition, which renders theservices of the slave so difficult and interrupted, that it is presumedthe buyer would not have purchased had he been aware of them,134 SLAVERY.And that the failure to make the reference did not proceedfrom inattention, is manifest by the 2506th article, which succeedsthat just noticed, wherein the defects in other animals are extendedto the cases supposed in the 2496th. So that the cause turns onthe inquiry, is drunkenness a vice of body, or of character 1 Isit mental, or physical 1 We think it must be classed among thevices which our code denominates those of character. It has oflate, we believe, been made a question by physiologists, whether thedisposition to an immoderate use of ardent spirits, did not arise asmuch from physical temperament as from moral weakness. Incases of long indulgence in the habit, it is quite probable the bodymay require a continuance of the stimulus, and that the desire forthe use of it may spring as much from physical lassitude, as frommoral depravity. But on this subject the court has a safer guidethan the conflicting opinions of medical men. By the ancient jurisprudenceof the country, the vice of drunkenness was consideredone. of the mind. And the terms used in our legislationmust be understood in the sense in which they were used in thatjurisprudence, unless another meaning be expressly given to themby legislative authority. We conclude, then, that the allegationmade in the petition does not furnish ground for setting aside thesale. It has been contended, that there was fraud in the defendantconcealing from the plaintiff the defect to which the slavewas addicted. But unless the vice was one which furnished groundfor redhibition, there was no fraud in concealing it, or, in otherwords, there was no obligation in the seller to communicate it tothe buyer.GAILLARD v. Laban et al. Dec.

This is not an action for redhibition.The plaintiff claims a recision of the contract, not on the groundOF WARRANTY. 135that such a habit forms a redhibitory defect in a slave, but on thealleged false assertion, on the part of the defendant, of the qualitiesof the slave in question, on a fraudulent concealment of hervices and defects, and he relies upon article 1841 of the LouisianaCode. But whether the defendant knew of the existence of thevice of drunkenness, and concealed it, is a question for the jury,and judgment rescinding the sale will be affirmed, when the verdictfinding the fraud is not so unsupported by evidence as toauthorize the court to disturb it.3.CHRETIEN v. THEARD. June T. 1824. 14 Martin s LouisianaRep. 582.Per Cur. Porter, J. This is a redhibitory action, in which the An allegesseeks to return a slave he purchased from the defendant,and get back the price. The defect alleged is, that the slave isa thief, and addicted to robbery, and it is further charged, that the evidencevendor knew he had those vices, at the time he sold him. The in the habitevidence establishes, very satisfactorily, that the slave was a thief of steam satthe time he was sold ; that he committed theft after he cameinto the possession of the plaintiff; and that the defendant wellknew he was addicted to this vice at the time he sold him. Severalgrounds of defence have been presented in this court against theright of the petitioner to recover. First. That the allegations in thepetition do not correspond with the proof. The first objectionwas supported by the counsel for defendant, on the ground thatthe petition charged the slave with being addicted to robbery, andthat the evidence went to prove he was in the habit of stealing. Arecurrence to the petition shows that this exception is not wellfounded. It does not merely charge that the slave was addictedto robbery. It avers also, that he was a thief; that he had a propensityto thieving, and it sets out a particular act of larceny.These allegations fully authorized the introduction of the evidencetaken on the trial, and even if they did not, the defendant couldnot claim the benefit of the variance in this court, when he sufferedthe proof to be received without objection, in that of the firstinstance.136 SLAVERY.4.- OWEN v.

The petition states that the plaintiffbill of sale purchased from the defendants a negro slave for $900, under theassurance they gave him, that he was a good domestic, good coachesman anc i cr 00 d brickmaker, and possessed of the confidence of hisbriquetier,and he be former owner, whose executors they are ; that there has been agross fraud practised on him by the defendants ; that the plaintiff,fully conch ing in the assurance they gave him, signed the bill ofcoachman, sa i 6) without reading it ; not believing that any thing containedtherein would have been inserted contrary to, or in opposition ofthe formal assurances given him, in relation to the qualities of theOF WARRANTY. 137slave, in which he avers he was deceived. The petition next setsforth, that the slave has made several attempts to run away, and isby habit a drunkard and thief, and was in the said bad practiceslong before the sale, at least in the knowledge of one of the defendants.It concludes with a prayer for the recision of the sale.Urquhart, one of the defendants, being interrogated by the plaintiff,answers, that he gave no assurances as to the virtues, vices, or talentsof the slave ; that he knew nothing of him, except that he calledhimself a coachman. The bill of sale was introduced as evidenceof the assurances stated in the petition ; the defendants thereinwarrant the negro sold, free from redhibitory diseases only, as wellas of any lien or mortgage, but not as to any redhibitory vice,declaring that they do not know the slave. In the description ofhim, he is stated to be 25 years of age, a good domestic, coachmanand brickmaker: bon domestique, collier, et frequenter. Four witnesses,introduced by the plaintiff, declared, that the slave was, fromhe moment he was taken into the family of the plaintiff, that is,immediately after the sale, a worthless, idle, drunken fellow, andknew nothing of the business of a coachman. A witness introducedby the defendants deposed, that he knew the slave, whowas the deceased s coachman, and bore a good character ; another,the deceased s overseer, deposed he knew the slave during a periodof two years, while he belonged to the deceased ; that he was atfirst employed as a brickmaker, was next the deceased s coachman,and afterwards as the driver of his other slaves ; that he wasa very faithful servant, and had the confidence of his master, whowas very severe to his slaves ; that he saw the negro drunk butonce, and he never attempted to run away ; that the deceased gave$1800 dollars for him and his wife. On this the district judge gavejudgment for the plaintiff. The defendants appealed.The statement of facts is composed of the bill of sale, and thedepositions of the above witnesses, and the defendant s counsel haswaived any objection to the want of an averment in the petition ofthe falsity of so much of the bill of sale as relates to the slave beinga good coachman ; he contends, that they are not liable for any butphysical or bodily defects, having declared that the warranty didnot extend to moral ones, vices ; and that the plaintiff has failed inthe proof of the knowledge, in the defendants, of any circumstancewhich they were bound to disclose. That the allegation, that theslave was sold as a good domestic, a good coachman, and a goodbrickmaker, is not supported by the proof offered ; the bill of sale13 8 SLAVERY.representing the slave as a coachman, not a good coachman ; thatthe defendants, knowing the slave to have been the deceased scoachman, might well describe him as a coachman ; that in thephrase used, the adjective, according to the French language, governsonly the substantive, which it immediately precedes, and is notnecessarily applicable to others in the phrase, bon dominique, cockerbriquetier; that, if it be doubtful whether the adjective is to beextended to the two last substantives, the construction must be infavour solutionis. That these witnesses prove, that the slave wasa good domestic, since he had been selected to oversee his fellowservants ; had a good character ; that he never attempted to runaway,and was seen drunk but once in two years. The plaintiff scounsel contends, that he has proved that the slave was deficientin the quality which induced him to purchase ; that he knewnothing of the business of a coachman ; that he was not a gooddomestic, since four witnesses swear that he has been, ever sincethe purchase, an idle, worthless, and drunken fellow. This court isof opinion, that the evidence, introduced by the defendants, repelsall the allegations of fraud made by the plaintiff, and supports theaverment they made, that the slave sold was a good domestic, acoachman, and brickmaker ; for we think, with their counsel, thatthe adjective bon, does not necessarily attach to any but the immediatesubstantive, domestique, and that if there be any doubt, theconstruction ought to be made so as to lessen, rather than to increasethe obligation. Perhaps a literal translation into the Englishlanguage might present a different idea. And the rule of the commonlaw of England is in opposition to that which we are tofollow. The common law says, verba fortis accipiunter contrapreference ; the civil law requires the constructions to be in favorrum solutionis. Neither is the testimony of defendant s witnessesmuch weakened by that of those of the plaintiff s, though the latter bemore numerous. These swear, that the slave knew nothing of thebusiness of a coachman, and is an idle, worthless, and drunken fellow.He might conceal his skill from his dislike of a new master ; a greatindulgence might render him idle, and free access to liquors mightinduce him to drink to excess ; and he consequently would appearidle, drunk, and worthless.But this does not disprove what is sworn on the opposite side :that, previous to the sale, under a severe master, he was a faithful servant,bore a good character, and possessed the confidence of thedeceased ; circumstances which strongly justify the assertion ofthe defendants, that he was a good domestic. The depositions ofOF WARRANTY. 139the plaintiff s witnesses do not disprove what is sworn by those ofthe defendants, that the slave was a coachman and brick maker.Judgment for defendants.8.Scar v. Stars. January T. 1835. 7 Louisiana Rep. 517.This was a redhibitory action to annul the sale of a slave, and re Crazinesscover back the price, on the ground of redhibitory vice of craziness. f/The plaintiff alleged, that he purchased of the defendant a slavenamed Kate, for which he paid $500, and in two or three days it is not ap-afterit was discovered the slave was crazy, and run away, and that annul thethe vices were known to the defendant.The witnesses stated she was very stupid ; that on being told todoone thing she would do another; and that she was unsafe to betrusted about the house, on account of the danger of setting fire toit; that she wandered off, and was finally put in the parish jail ofan adjoining parish, as a runaway.The district judge gave judgment, that with regard to the mentalmalady of the slave, the evidence and a personal inspection satisfiedhim she was so far destitute of mental capacity as to renderher either absolutely useless, or the use so inconvenient, that itwas to be presumed the buyer would not have purchased had heknown of the vice. The defendant appealed.Per Cur. Bullard, J. It was contended, that Kate was notcrazy, but only stupid, and stupidity is not madness ; but, on thecontrary, an apparent defect, against which the defendant did notwarrant. Mere dulness of look is certainly apparent ; but thatdegree of stupidity or want of intelligence, which results from adefective organization, is rather idiocy than stupidity. The codeenumerates madness (folie,) among the absolute vices of slaveswhich give rise to the action of redhibition.Whether the subject of this action is idiotic from nativity, orislaboring under one of the numberless derangements of an intellectoriginally sound, is a question which cannot be answered,without further knowledge of her history, than the record affords.Nor do we consider it material, inasmuch as the code has declared,that a sale may be avoided on account of any vice or defect, whichrenders the thing either absolutely useless, or its use so inconvenientand imperfect, that it must be supposed the buyer would nothave purchased with a knowledge of the vice. We are satisfiedthat the slave in question was wholly, and perhaps worse thanuseless.140 SLAVERY.9.LANDREAUX et al. v. CAMPBELL. June T. 1830. 20 Martin sLouisiana Rep. 478.When the Mathews, J., delivered the opinion of the court. This is a red-prohibitoryhistory action, in which the plaintiffs claim restitution of the pricenot mani of a slave, named Ned, which they allege was affected with thewithin* 18 absolute vice of madness, (as denominated by the La Code,) atafter 6 the 78 ^ time ^ e 7 P urc ^ case( ^ m m fr om ^ defendant. They obtainedsale, evil judgment in the court below, from which the latter appealed. Adericemust , ,, r /,be given of decision of the cause depends principally on matters ol met, liable to the provisions of the 2508th art. of the code. Accordingto these provisions, " a buyer who institutes the prohibitoryaction must prove, that the vice existed before the sale wasmade to him. But when it has made its appearance within threedays immediately following the sale, it is presumed to have existedbefore the sale." In the present case there is no evidence whichshows the existence of the malady or vice previous to the sale.Several witnesses were examined on the part of the defendant, whoproved the soundness of the slave in question previous to, and atthe time he was sold to the plaintiff. The act of sale was passedat Natchez, on the 4th of January, 1828, and recorded in theoffice of a notary, in the city of New-Orleans, on the 12th of thesame month. The precise time at which Ned (together with otherslaves bought at Natchez, and conveyed to the plaintiff by the sameact,) arrived on the plantation of the purchasers, is not shown bythe testimony of the cause. There were three witnesses examinedfor the appellees, two by commissions on interrogatories, and onein open court. The first of these appears to have been the overseerof the plaintiffs at the period when the slaves were brought totheir plantation, and is the only one, who according to the factsdeclared in the testimony of all three, was in a situation to discoverany appearance of madness in Ned within three days after the sale.He states that he remained on the plantation from the arrival of theslaves, some time in January, until the 6th of February, or aboutone month after they were placed under his management. Duringthat period he declares that he did not perceive that the negrowas attacked by any infirmity chacun infirmity ; he only appearedto be of a feeble constitution, was lazy, and would not work withoutbeing constantly watched ; and when out of sight of the overseer,he would quit his work and wander from one place toanother, gesticulating alone, tout soul This testimony certainlyOF WARRANTY. 141exhibits great defects in the slave, but does not, in our opinion,amount to proof of madness ; at all events, of its appearance withinthree days from the time of purchase. And there is no proof thathe was subject to any mental derangement previous to that period.Considering the many frauds which are practised on purchasers,by professed dealers in this species of property, we have reluctantlycome to a conclusion on the facts different from that at which thejudge, a quo, arrived. But it is believed by us, that the plaintiffs havenot sustained their claim for redhibition by such proof as is requiredby law.10.ZARICO v. Sabine. March T. 1818. 5 Martin s LouisianaRep. 372.The plaintiff, as executrix to her late husband, caused the pro The veneryof his estate to be sold at public auction, under the authorityand directions of the court of probates, when the defendant, through precisionof the sale,an agent, bid for a negro man, was adjudged her, and immediate on accountly delivered to her said agent, who directed him to go to the defendants.The negro, on his way, made his escape, and, being mitted byi i T the slavepursued, committed an assault, with intent to murder, for which immediatelywas tried and condemned to death, but afterwards pardoned 8 aie. eand released. The defendant having refused to receive him, thepresent suit was brought against her. One of the grounds onwhich she resisted the plaintiff s demand, was, that if there was asale, it ought to be annulled, on account of a redhibitory vice inthe slave. There was judgment for the plaintiff, and the defendantappealed.Per Cur. Derbigny, J. We now come to the second plea ofthe appellant, to wit, the existence of a redhibitory vice in the propertysold. The success of this plea rests upon the following circumstance: Immediately after the sale and delivery, this slave,instead of going where the appellant s agent sent him, ran off, waspursued, and committed an assault, for which he was condemnedto death, and afterwards pardoned. From this the appellant concludes,that the slave had a redhibitory vice previous to the adjudication.To support this allegation, he relies on the following articleof our code, as governing this case, to the exclusion of alltestimony : " If the defect appears immediately after the sale, orwithin the three following days, it shall be presumed that said defectexisted before the sale, or at the time it was made." This142 SLAVERY.provision seems to have been intended for cases of latent bodilydefects, the origin of which is uncertain. But as the appellantinsists upon its applicability to his case, let us see how it will bearthe application. The vice, if any existed, was one of temper anddisposition. Those are limited to three sorts : " Having beenguilty of some capital crime, being addicted to robbery, or in thehabit of running away The first vice does not admit of the applicationof the rule, that a man has been guilty of a capital crime,and is not to be presumed from his subsequent conduct. The lawdoes not speak of any such thing as the habit of committing crimes,but of a crime committed. The second vice has nothing to dowith this case. The third, and last, is the habit of running away.This slave, it is said, ran off, instead of going where the appellant sagent had told him to go. Must this be received as a legal presumptionthat he was in the habit of running away 1 Shall a slavewho changes masters, and runs off to avoid going with him, bepresumed to be in the habit of running away 1 Surely no suchpresumption can arise from this fact. Supposing, then, the articlerelied on to be at all applicable to this kind of vice, still, the fact inthis case does not authorize the presumption, so far as to render itunnecessary to support it by other proof, or to exclude contrarytestimony. The district judge, therefore, acted correctly in admittingtestimony as to the character of the slave ; and that testimonyhaving been perfectly satisfactory on the part of the plaintiff,the plea of the defendant must fail. Judgment affirmed.11.Angry et al. v. FOY. July T. 1819. 7 Martin s LouisianaRep. 33. 44.What a ^ er @ ur Martin, J. At the request of the defendant, a remountsto hearing has been had in this case, on the question whether Ho-runninga- race and Boucaud, two of the slaves sold by the defendant to theplaintiffs, were really in the habit of running away, at the time ofthe sale, so as to entitle the plaintiffs to their redhibitory action.The fact was found against the defendant by the jury, in the parishcourt ; and, although this circumstance is not conclusive on theappeal, it cannot fail to have some weight. Horace was purchasedby the defendant in March, 1808, and his vendor then expresslyexcluded the legal warranty against such vices, which the law considersas redhibitory ones, viz. capital crimes, robbery, and thehabit of running away. This appears by the bill of sale on reefWARRANTY. 143cord ; and the vendor did declare, that Horace ran away fromhim, and was absent seven consecutive months ; during which hewent to New York, Liverpool, and Charleston, where he was arrestedand brought to New Orleans ; where, five weeks after, hesold him to the present defendant, informing him he was a runaway; and he was sold as such. It is in evidence, that Boucaudwas brought to jail as a runaway before the sale to the plaintiff,and that he has since run away twice. In the sale of Boucaudto the defendant, the vendor warrants only against the maladiesfor which the Jaw grants a redhibitory action. The counsel forthe defendant thinks the jury and this court erred, in inferringfrom this testimony, that the slaves were in the habit of runningaway ; that one single instance of running away is proven anteriorto the sale, which cannot constitute a habit. As to Horace strips to New York, to Liverpool, and Charleston, and an absenceof seven months, which ended by his capture only ; the circumstanceof his being sold as a runaway ; the information given bythe defendant s vendor, that he was a runaway, justify, in our opinion,the conclusion which the jury and this court have taken. Asto Boucaud, the circumstances of his having been purchased bythe defendant, with a simple warranty of the redhibitory maladies,of his having been committed to jail as a runaway once, wouldnot authorize the same conclusion. But he ran away twice,within a very few days after the plaintiffs purchased him, whichraises a presumption, when coupled with the preceding facts, thatthe habit of running away existed before the sale. Indeed, thecases of these slaves are not easily to be distinguished from that ofMarty v. Batteries, 1 Martin s Rep. 149. There, there was noevidence of any repeated act of running away before the sale, butthe slave had been kept several months in jail, and not liberatedtherefrom till the sale, and ran away soon after. Thus, Horace svoyages to New York, Liverpool, and Charleston, and the declarationof his then master, excite as much apprehension and alarm,as evidence of three ordinary acts of running away. It is thereforeordered, adjudged, and decreed, that the judgment of thiscourt in this case be certified to the parish court, as if no rehearinghad been granted.144 SLAVERY.12.AXDRY et al. v. FOY. June T. 1819. 6 Martin s LouisianaRep. 689.Although The plaintiff s bought from the defendant nine slaves, for10,500, payable in their note at one year. Six of them having successivelyran away, they brought the present suit for the recisionand for a o f the sale, alleging, that the slaves were addicted to running away,price, the in the knowledge of the defendant, prior to the sale. There wasTot 6 b e W re judgment for the recision of the sale as to the six slaves who ran^jndedfor wa ^ and the defendants condemned to the payment of $6,500.timber Both parties appealed.the 8 whole Per Cur. Martin, J. It is true, the slaves were not sold separately,and for distinct prices ; and after the sale the vendees verydefect. f use( j to re t a in any of them, and rescind the sale for the others ;but insisted on an entire compliance with, or an absolute recisionof the contract. These circumstances do not, however, appear toussufficient to authorize the vendees in demanding the recision ofthe sale of all the slaves, on account of a redhibitory defect in oneor more of them. For they did not constitute a whole, as a companyof comedians, or a span of horses, in which the value of each ofthe component parts is increased by its union to the rest. It istrue, after the sale, the vendees declared their willingness to annulit in tito, and refused to do so partially ; a circumstance, which ispresented to us as giving rise to the presumption, that they wouldnot have agreed to the purchase of any number of these slaves,less than the whole. The presumption, however, appears to us tooslight to be received as evidence. We therefore conclude, thatthe parish court did not err in refusing to rescind the sale in toto.The habit of running away is a redhibitory vice. Civ. Code. 358.art 79. A warranty against it is, therefore, of the nature of thecontract of sale of slaves, i. e. it needs not be expressed in thedeed. Hence the silence of the vendor in this case, as to thiswarranty, does not prevent him from being bound thereto. Neitherdoes it appear to us that the circumstance of his having disclosedto his vendees the names of his own vendors, and referred, in hisact of sale, to those of the latter, in any degree lessens his liability.This warranty, however, not being of the essence of the contract,may be excluded by the agreement of the parties. But the agreementmust be proven, and the exclusion must be a fair one; thatOF WARRANTY. 145is to say, the vendor must be ignorant of, or disclose the existenceof the vice. In the present case, it is clear, that the disposition ofsix of these slaves to run away was known to the vendor, andthat he did not communicate it to the vendees. The understandingof the parties, that the slaves should remain on trialduring a fortnight, with the vendees, at the risk of the vendor, incasethey ran away, does not enable us to conclude, that the intentionof the parties was, that if after that period, they, or any ofthem ran away, and the vendees could prove a previous habit ofrunning away, they should not avail themselves of the legal warranty.The existence of this habit in the six slaves, of whom thesale is rescinded by the judgment of the parish court, clearly appearsfrom the evidence on the record, particularly the depositionof the jailor, and the orders of the mayor.The defendant was bound, at the inception of the suit, to reimbursethe price of these slaves ; but this price was not fixed bythe parties, and required to be liquidated. The parish court,therefore, erred in allowing interest from the date of the judicialdemand. But no hire can be allowed. Both parties complain ofthe valuation made in the parish court, the vendor thinking it extravagant,and the vendees insufficient. Perhaps this is the bestevidence of its correctness. It does not appear to us so materiallyincorrect as to authorize our interference.It is, therefore, ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that the judgmentof the parish court be annulled, avoided, and reversed j andthis court, proceeding to render such a judgment as, in its opinion,ought to have been rendered in the parish court, it is ordered,adjudged, and decreed, that the sale of the negroes, Lindor, Tony,Sunday, Isaac, Horace and Bjucaud, be rescinded, and madenull and void ; and that the plaintiffs do recover from the defendantthe sum of six thousand five hundred dollars, with costs,in the parish court, and that the plaintiffs pay costs in this court.13.CHRETIEN v. THEARD. June T. 1824. 14 Martin s LouisianaRep. 582.Per Cur. Porter, J. This is a redbibitory action, in which the Stealingplaintiff seeks to return a slave he purchased from the defendant, acc^mpa-^and get back the price. The defect alleged, i*, that the slave is a ed withforce tothief, and addicted to robbery. And it is further charged, that the constitute avendor knew he had those vices, at the time he sold him. Several defect,* 017grounds of defence have been presented in this court against the146 SLAVERY.right of the petitioner. The second point of the defendant is,that the vice complained of, is not a redhibitory one ; that thestealing must be accompanied with force, to constitute this defect.If this construction be the true one, it will lead to the most inconvenientresults, and open the door to great and numerous fratThis consideration, we are aware, is not of much importance, if thelaw be clear and free from ambiguity ; but if otherwise, it is entitledto much weight in aiding our conclusions as to the purport andtrue meaning of the statute. The words of the law in the Frenchtext, are " si 1 esclave est donne au vol ;" in the English " if he isaddicted to robbery." Vol is the generic term, in the Frenchlanguage, for theft of every kind, and, it is admitted, embraceslarceny. Robbery, it is said, means the offence known to ourcriminal law, as such. And it is urged, that the English versionshows, that the word vol in the French was used in the restrictedsense of taking the property of another by force. Our code waspassed previous to the enactment of the constitution, and the legislaturein adopting it, directed that the French and English texts mustbe taken together ; and that they should mutually serve for the interpretationof each other. 2 Martin s Dig. 98. Whenever,therefore, the expressions can be reconciled, and made to harmonisewith each other, it is the duty of those on whom the task ofconstruing them is devolved, to do so. When they cannot, sucha construction must be adopted as does violence to neither, andgives effect to both. Thus, if the French part of the law madeepilepsy alone a redhibitory defect, and the English had providedonly for leprosy, we should hold, that both these diseases constitutedvices for which the sale could be annulled ; because both wereprovided for ; and because at that time the legislative will expressedin either language, became a law. In the case of Tour v. Gushing,decided at the last July term, this principle was applied to the122d article of the code, 369. The text there presented two distinctideas to the mind, and we thought a compliance with either,sufficient on the part of him who claimed the benefit of the law ;otherwise, as was there said, the statute in relation to that provision,would be a decoy, instead of a beacon. And where they are notentirely different, as in the case before us, where the word in onetext includes the meaning used in the other, and means somethingmore, we must, on the same principle, take that which presentsthe most enlarged sense, because, in doing so, we give full effectto both clauses.OF WARRANTY. 147(C.) OF THE WARRANTY OF CAPACITY.I.STRAWBRIDGE v. WARFIELD. April T. 1832. 4 LouisianaRep* 20.Per Cur. Porter, J. The question is, whether warranty on thepart of the owner of the property sold (slaves) be of the essence Warrantyis not theof the contract of sale ; and this question the law requires us to essence ofanswer in the negative. Warranty is in the nature of the contractof sale. That is, the law, implies it, if a contrary agreement benot made. But it is not essential to such a contract. Thevendor may stipulate, he will not warrant at all ; or he maycovenant that his warranty shall be restricted ; or he may contractthat his vendee shall accept the warranty of a third person.*2.Pile v. Balance et al. April T. 1829. 19 Martin s LouisianaRep. 648.Porter, J., delivered the opinion of the court. This is an action Jj * red ^-of redhibition. The defendant pleaded the general issue.

The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, reducing the price after he$170. The defendants have appealed, and the plaintiff has re chased.quire that the judgment be amended by the court decreeing a recisionof the sale. The evidence is contradictory, and does not authorizeus to disturb the verdict. The only questions which requireour particular attention are those presented by the two billsof exceptions, taken on the trial by the defendants. The plaintiffoffered evidence to prove that the slave had run away after he hadpurchased her, and the court admitted it. We think there wasno error in doing so. The proof in itself would not be sufficientto establish the fact, without showing that the slave had run awayAn express warranty does not guard against that which can be discovered byflight; as if a horse be warranted perfect, and he wants an ear or a tail, Butterfield v.Burroughs, Salk. Rep. 211. But an express warranty extends to every kind of soundnessknown and unknown to the seller. 15 Petersdorff s Abr. 374.Upon the sale of a ship advertised as copper fastened, with all faults, the court held,that these faults meant, faults of a ship, which might have been consistent with thatdescription of vessel ; and that not being a copper-fastened ship at all it was a breachof the warranty. Shepard v. King, 3, B. & A. 240.148 SLAVERY.while in the possession of the vendor. But if the facts in regardto the absence of the slave antecedent to the sale were in anywayequivocal, subsequent acts might aid in ascertaining their truecharacter. The evidence, too, might be important, in showing acontinuance of the habit which existed at the time of the sale. Ithas been the constant practice in actions of this kind, to admit suchproofs. 7 Martin s Rep. 43. ; 10 Ibid. 659. Judgment affirmed.(D.) OF THE WARRANTY OF TITLE.*I.Coward et al. v. REYNOLDS.

It being ascertained the boy was .free, the present actionwas brought, to recover the amount of expenses incurred by theplaintiffs while the boy was in their possession.The Court. Mathews, J. The surety of the vendor of a slavewho warrants only the title, is not liable for expenses to which thevendee is put in consequence of the slave being affected with theredhibitory vice of running away ; but he is responsible for damagesincurred in case of eviction.It was held, in Mackbee v. Gardner, 2 Har. & Gill s Rep. 176 , that it was afamiliar principle, that there exists, in every sale of personal property an impliedwarranty of title. And the same principle was recognized in Chasm v. Woods,Hard. Rep. 531. ; Osgood v. Lewis, 2 Har. & Gill s Rep. 495. In Demesne v.Trumpet 1 Johns. Rep. 274, it appeared the defendant sold the plaintiff a horse,which was recovered of the plaintiff by a third person. The defendant contendedthe plaintiff could not recover, as there was no warranty, or fraud in the sale. Butthe court said, we are of opinion that an express warranty is not requisite ; for it isa general rule, that the law will imply a warranty of title on the sale of a chattel.The rule is laid down in 2 Black. Com. 451., that by the civil law, an implied warrantywas annexed to every sale, in respect to the title of the vendor ; and so too, inour law, a purchaser of goods and chattels may have satisfaction of the seller, if hesells them as his own, and the title proves deficient without any express warranty forthe purpose.And the same rule prevails in Great Britian. In contracts for the sale of personalproperty, the vendor impliedly warrants his title to the article he sells ; and if hehas no title, he is liable for a breach of this implied promise. 15 Peterson a Abr. 372.And the rule applies whether the seller is in possession of the tiling sold or not,Ibid. ; 3 T.

The question is, whether the fact of the ofasalebyvendor of the slave having concealed from the purchaser, no mat a broker.ter with what intention, the fact of ho being the real owner,makes him responsible in warranty 1 We think not. It is clear,that the plaintiff could not now have the contract avoided on theground that the defendant was acting merely as a broker, and wasnot the owner, as plaintiff supposed. For error in person withwhom he contracted could not enable him to do so ; the considerationof the person not being the principal cause of the contract.If the plaintiff could not have the contract set aside, we can discoverno legal grounds on which it can be changed, and a subsidiarywarranty granted to the buyer, for which he did not contract.3.SCOTT et al. v.

It is a general and familiar principle,that there exists in every sale of personal property an impliedwarranty of title, and that the vendor cannot be a witness to sustainthe title of the vendee. But here the witness was a meretrustee ; and in that capacity sold the property.

Ellis, not having paid off the sale bond, filed a billto enjoin the payment, and the circuit court perpetuated the injunction.The court of appeals reversed the decree, and suggestedthat either Browning or the sheriff was liable , but that M Gee,notwithstanding the foregoing facts, was entitled to the amount forwhich the negro sold. Ellis then sued Forsyth, and recoveredjudgment for the price of the negro, and the sheriff brought thiswrit of error.Per Cur. Robertson, Ch. J. The question is, whether the sheriffis responsible to the purchaser for any defect of title. When,an individual sells personal property as his own, the law implies awarranty of title. But this rule does not apply to sales by an agent,whether he be a public or private agent. He does not sell theproperty as his own, and, generally, can be made responsible onlyfor actual franc, or gross negligence. In sales under execution,it seems to us, that it cannot be, nor has ever been understood,that the officer, either personally or officially, guarantees the title.And the fact, that no case is reported in which the sheriff was eversued for an implied warranty, ought to have persuasive, if not decisiveinfluence.6.Kettles v.

Fall T. 1833. 1 Dana s Rep. 578.Cromwell sued Clay in detinue, for a slave which one Orear The pur-soldto Cromwell at a time when Piper and Waugh had suits sk^whHeagainst Orear, for the purpose of subjecting the slaves to the pay a su isment of his debts. Clay took the slaves into his possession as subject it todeputy sheriff, on an order by the chancellor. And the question dorWebtn,was, whether the deed of a purchaser pendente lite is void or JVOidable. dent on theevent ofthesuit.152 SLAVERY.Per Cur. Underwood, J. The bill of sale from Orear to Cromwellwas not absolutely void, as the circuit court supposed. Asthe chancery suits had not yet been decided, it could not be affirmedthat the complainants would certainly obtain decrees subjectingthe slave to the payment of their demands. If the billsshall be dismissed, ten the bill of sale is unquestionably good.Nor does it lose its efficacy until the decree is pronounced in favorof the complainants. In the mean time, the title of the slave willvest under it in Cromwell.If a decree is rendered subjecting the slave to the payment ofOrear s debts, such decree will avoid the bill of sale, to the extentof the debts. If a surplus is left on the sale of a slave, after payingthe debts, such surplus might be claimed by Cromwell. Thebill of sale is liable to be avoided by the decree, but it is not void.If the suit had been against Orear, the result would have been different.He could not protect himself by averring the pendency ofa suit against him for the slave. Here the possession of the sheriffis under the authority of law, and the owner, having been detestedof the possession, by an order of the chancellor, cannot reclaim itbut by leave of the court.(VIII.)

The ownerdie without can, of course, sell, mortgage, or hire out the property as he pleases, subject only tothose rules which society has established for the regulation and government of personalfor in such estate. But however unlimited the owner may be in the use of the thing, the slavecase the himself cannot hire himself out in any of the states. The statutes of the states containowner ft pro hj D i t j on w eth a penalty against the slave going at large, or hiring himself out. Bythe* hire the digest of the laws of Alabama, 1836. p. 393. $ 14. it is declared, that if any per-fromthe son shall permit his or her slave to go at large, or hire him or herself out, every per-death.gon or p persons so offending shall forfeit and pay $50 ; and the slave may be committed,and the owner prosecuted. And, by the Rev. Code of Virginia, vol. 1. p. 442.,HIRING OF SLAVES. 153Per Cur. The only question in the case is, whether the plaintiffshould be allowed a credit on his bond from the time of thenegro s death to the end of the year, for so much as the hire forthat time would amount to. The court understands the rule to be,where one hires a slave for a year, that if the slave be sick, orrun away, the tenant must pay the hire ; but if the slave die withoutany fault in the tenant, the owner, and not the tenant, shouldlose the hire from the death of the slave, unless otherwise agreedupon. By pursuing this rule, the act of God falls on the owner,on whom it must have fallen if the slave had not been hired ;from which time it would be unreasonable to allow the owner hire.Hire ! for what 1 for a dead negro ! It would be rigid enough inthe case of a special agreement ; but where there is no such specialagreement, to insist upon the hire appears to this court unjust inthe extreme. See 1 Ruth.

The defendants pleaded, that byinevitable accident the slave Dick was drowned in the Ohio river,whereby they were prevented from returning the said slave on theday, &c. To this plea the plaintiff demurred. The court gavejudgment overruling the demurrer.81, it is declared, that a slave going at large, or hiring himself out, may be committedby a magistrate, and may fine the owner, or may order the slave to be sold. Andalso by the Rev. Code of Mississippi, 374. 25, 26., the owner is prohibited fromlicensing his slave to go at large and trade as a freeman, or hiring himself out. Provisionis made whereby the slave may be seized, the owner fined, and$ in certaincases, the slave may be sold. And by 20. any citizen may seize a slave offering articlesfor sale, and take him before a justice of the peace, and the justice shall orderthe slave to be whipped, and forfeit the article to the person apprehending the slave.Similar provisions are to be found in the statute books of those states where thisspecies of property is recognized.154 SLAVERY.Per Cur. Owsley, J. We do not construe the instrument toinsure a return of the slave in case of his death. It was no doubtcompetent for the parties to contract upon^terms most acceptableto themselves, and it is incumbent upon the court, to effectuate thecontract according to what may be their supposed intention ; butit is not inferrable from any thing contained in the writing uponwhich the action is founded, that the contracting parties intendedto insure a return of the slave in case of his death. The writingcontains no express stipulation to that effect, and there is not suchan inadequacy between what may be supposed the value of ayear s service of the slave, and the price agreed to be paid by theBruce, as to afford any rational inducement from them, in additionto the hire which they were to pay, to insure the life of the slave.3.KEAS v. Sewell. Fall T. 1834. 2 Dana s Rep. 348. S. P. SINGLETON v. CARROLL, 6 J. J. Marshall s Rep. 528.Ye well filed a bill against Keas to foreclose a mortgage on twoby a bond slaves, and upon an order of the court, Keas gave bond to haveture the of ni a ^ e s ^ aves forthcoming to answer the decree. Upon the final de-covenantcree, one of the slaves not being forthcoming, according to thethe slave bond, Ye well sued Keas and his sureties on the bond. The defend-editiono? n a ants pleaded that the slave ran away between the execution of thedecree, and b on( j an( j t ^ e ren dition of the decree, and that they could not rederuns , Jaway. claim her. Verdict and judgment for plaintiff, and the defendantsbrought error.Per Cur. Nicholas, J. In our estimation, the plea constitutesa valid defence to the action. The casualty by which the slavewas lost is a peril incident to the very nature of such property ;and therefore in contracts and covenants concerning such property,that peril should never be presumed to have been intended to beguarded against, unless so expressly stipulated. It has accordinglybeen held by the court of appeals in Virginia, and by this court,that the hirer of a slave was excused, by the fact of the slave havingrun away without his fault, from his covenant to return theslave at the end of the year. In Singleton v. Carroll, the covenantof the hirer was as express, unambiguous, and unconditional,as that of the parties here. The same principle which exemptedthe hirer from responsibility there, must relieve the obligors in thisbond also. The principle is laid down in that case, that the loss isnot to be considered as provided against by a general covenant,HIRING OF SLAVES. 155and its happening therefore presents the same excuse for nonperformance,that the death of the slave would have done.

T. 1814. 1 North Carolina LawRepository, 365.The defendant hired of plaintiff, a negro boy about 16 years of whereage, who was consumed by fire in the defendant s still house, with Ss t 8la ethicscontents, which were valuable, the defendant with some difficult , th e ,fault of thecult escaping. hirer.The judge informed the jury, that if the time of hiring was notexpired, the defendant was not bound, if he used ordinary care andattention, such as a prudent man would afford to his own property.On returning the verdict, the jury said, that they were of opinion,that the time of hiring had not expired, and gave the plaintiff threemonths hiring, at the rate of four dollars per month, making sixpounds.Per Cur. Sewell, J. The declaration in this case contains twocounts : one to recover the value of the slave, the other to recoverthe hire.As to the first, the jury found that the time of hiring was notexpired when the accident befel the slave, and that the accidentwas not owing to the negligence of the defendant.As to the other count, the jury found for the plaintiff, and assesseddamages to six pounds. From the evidence on the trial, theplaintiff (if entitled at all on that count) was entitled to abouttwelve pounds. The defendant s counsel offered to increase thedamages to that amount. As to the motion for a new trial, we areall of opinion, that the whole circumstances of the case were properlyleft to the jury, respecting the expiration of the time ; andthat the right of the plaintiff, in law, to recover, depending uponthat fact, which the jury have found against him ; that in a caseof doubtful evidence the court should not disturb the verdict.5.HARRISON v.

Though it may, at first blush,seem hard that Harrison should be compelled to pay hire for thenegro that died before the expiration of the term for which he washired, it will, upon mature reflection, be found not to be unjust inDarrell to exact the full hire of the negro. The uncertainty ofthe negro s life was equally known to both Harrison and Darrellwhen the contract for hire was entered into between them. Withthat knowledge it was competent for them to contract in the waymost acceptable to themselves, and when fairly made, the courtpossesses no power to alter or change the import of the contract.6.GRUNDY S HEIRS v.

Because the act of the tenant in fee is obligatory onthose claiming under him, as heir, devisee, or executor.158 SLAVERY.11.WILLIAM Everett et al. v.

The complainantscontended that the defendants, the executors of TemperanceLeverettt, should pay them for the hire of the negroes from thedeath of their testatrix, on the 25th of March, 1824, till the 10thday of January, 1825, when the crop was gathered.Dessaussure, Chancellor. The first exception depends uponthe construction of the statute of 1789, which exacts, that on thedeath of a tenant for life of any estate which may determinate atan uncertain time, such death occurring after the first of March,the slaves of the estate are to be continued on the estate to theend of the year, or as the exception expresses it, " the estate iscontinued to the end of the year." The complainants contend,and the commissioner has decided, that though the property be soHIRING OF SLAVES. 159continued under the statute, it is subject to hire. The statute doesnot say so, and never to my knowledge, has been so construed.I do not think it the sound construction, for I believe an essentialbenefit was intended, and not an illusory one. The exceptionmust be sustained, and so much of the report overruled and corrected.The complainants appealed.Per Cur. Colcock, J. This court concur with the Chancellorin his construction of the act of 1789 ; and I can safely say, thatI never heard a doubt expressed as to the correctness of such construction.It is in furtherance of the common law doctrine ofemblements, that he who has a right to sow shall be entitledto reap; which cannot be done in this country unless the negroesemployed in making the crop are permitted to remain to the endof the year. It would often be of little advantage to the persontaking, to remove the negroes after the crop is planted ; whereasit might operate as a total destruction of the crop. The appropriationof the crop, as assets in the hands of the executors, certainlynegatives the idea of allowing compensation by way of hire tothe person entitled to the negroes. Decree affirmed.12.Bacon v, PARNELL. Jan. T. 1831. 2 Bailey s Rep. 424.The action was brought upon a promissory note for the hire of Where aa slave, for one year.

Inthis case the act of God (the death of the slave) has ended the contractof hiring. The owner is entitled to receive, and the hirer isbound to pay, only so much as the hire was worth from the commencementof the hiring until the slave s death.160 SLAVERY.13.T. AND N. Shudder v. SEALS. June T. 1824. Walker s MississippiRep. 155.A refusal Per Cur. Ellis, J. After the death of Nathaniel Scudder, hisw y without S c o n wife administered upon the estate, and at the sale of the personallor of a title property, Margaret Scudder, daughter of the deceased, purchasedto restore .slaves upon Diesyy and Daniel, the negroes m controversy, for which she exe-of e the m true cited her promissory note. After the purchase she intermarriedhiT^osIes with one Thomas Seals, who reduced the negroes into possession,sion,issuch and worked them on the old lady s plantation, but separate andbring" d the S distinct from her crop. In July, 1822, Mrs. Thomas Seals died,the 6 ^ro h v anti ner h urban d s ld the standing crop, and hired the negroes tosionsofthe Thomas Scudder, one of the present defendants. The negroesHabeas , ., ., . .corpus act. were hired twice to Shudders, and finally came into the possessionof T. Seals, who carried them to the house of James Seals, theplaintiff below, who purchased said negroes. The petition ofJames Seals, supported by the oath of D. Muse, states that Diesyyand Daniel were either stolen or enticed out of his possession,some time in September last. Upon the hearing of the evidenceon both sides, the judge had the property restored to the petitioner.From the evidence introduced on the trial below, there cannotbe a doubt in relation to the right of property. The only questionfor our consideration is, whether the petitioner has brought himselfwithin the provisions of the 19th section of the habeas corpus act,which says : " If any slave or slaves for life shall be taken or seducedout of the possession of the master, owner or overseers ofsuch slave or slaves, by force, stratagem, or fraud, and unlawfullydetained in the possession of any other person," &c. The fact ofthe detention of the negroes by Scudder, when he must haveknown they did not belong to him, was an imposition upon therights of the plaintiff below, and will bring the case within, notonly the letter, but the spirit of the statute. It was a trick, a stratagem,to deprive the owner of the possession of his property, otherwisethey never would have been detained after legal demand beingmade. Diesyy and Daniel being in the possession of Scudder, isevidence they were taken by him, until the contrary appears ; anda refusal to deliver them over to the owner, is conclusive that hewished to hold the property without even the color of title. Thisamounts, (as I have before stated,) to imposition, trick and stratagem,presenting a case liable to the operation of the statute, inHIRING OF SLAVES. 161such case made and provided. I am of opinion the judgment ofthe court below ought to be affirmed14.Hilliard v. TOMLINSON. April T. 1810. 1 Munf. Rep. 183.BREWER v. HASTIE, 3 Call s Rep. 24. ; DEANS v.

The judgment rendered thereon was correct, and it is,therefore, adjudged and decreed, that it be affirmed with costs.16.KING v. COOPER, Executor of King. Dec. T. 1829. Walker sRep. 359.Per Cur. This was an action of assumpsit, brought by the ap Where A.pellet in the court below, as executor of the last will and testament breathingof George W. King, deceased. The second point raised in this ^h^ecase grows out of the following facts, stated in the bill of except in his .tions, viz. that a certain negro man, named Denis, (for whose at the testa*f162 SLAVERY.tor sdeath hire the plaintiff had in part sued,) had been hired by testator,and so re .mains, the a short time previous to his death, to the defendant ; the negroA Xe mares man was m l ^ e possession of defendant at testator s death, and thecover his testator, by his last will and testament, had bequeathed the said ne-hirefor the . .slave, up to gro man Dennis to the defendant ; that the plaintiff, as executor,of^oneyear ^ a( l demanded said negro from said defendant, immediately aftertestator s death, but the defendant refused to deliver up said negroletters tes t o the said plaintiff; that one year after letters testamentary hadto the tjxe- been granted, an order of the orphan s court had passed, "by during the executor to pay off the legatees and distributees. Thelaw, that counsel for the defendant requested the court to instruct the jury,ainineinto, that the said negro man Dennis, of right, and according to law, betidedebbfof longed to the defendant, and that the plaintiff was not entitled, at thethe estate. t me tm g ac ti OR was commenced, to recover from the defendant hirefor the negro s services since the death of the testator, without evidence,on the part of the plaintiff, that there were debts due by theestate, which could not be paid without it ; and the counsel furtherrequested the court to charge the jury, that plaintiff had misconceivedhis remedy, and was not entitled to recover in this form ofaction. All of which instructions the court refused to give. Thequestion for this court, arising upon this statement of facts, is,whether the defendant was bound to pay for the hire of this negroslave for the time specified in the agreement between him and thedeceased, inasmuch as the deceased had bequeathed said negro tohim, the said defendant. There would have been no doubt, if thisslave had been hired to a stranger, but that the plaintiff might haverecovered the hire ; and although this slave was bequeathed to thedefendant, he could not legally call on the executor for his bequest,until after the expiration of one year from the time of taking outletters testamentary. See Revised Code, p. 55. sec. 91. And althougha legal right in the property of said slave vested in the defendant,as legatee on the death of the plaintiff s testator; yet thelegatee could not reduce that right to possession, until after the expirationof one year from granting the said letters testamentary,during which time he was bound to pay the hire. The executorhad one year to examine into, and settle the debts, &c. of the estate.I am therefore, clearly of opinion, that the plaintiff had the sameright to have recovered this year s hire from the legatee, as hewould have had from a stranger, who had no interest in the bequestsof the deceased.

The court are of opinion,and direct the jury, that if they shall be of opinion, from the wholeof the evidence, that the plaintiff gave the negroes orders to returninconsistent with the contract and engagement made by the defendantand the plaintiff, then such directions, so given to the negroes,will release the defendant from any responsibility for theevent which afterwards happened. But the court refuse to directthe jury, that if the plaintiff did give the directions stated by thedefendant, in the manner, and under the circumstances so stated,the defendant is thereby freed from responsibility for the loss ofthe negroes.

It is true, the owner is indirectlypunished, by having his slave hired out for one year. But that isonly the incidental consequence of the judgment. The personalliability of the master is for the penalty of twenty pounds. Theact does not make him guilty of a misdemeanor, nor subject himto indictment. Judgment reversed.19.Grace v. JONES.

The sale of Campbell was never recorded in Louisiana.Judgment for defendant.Per Cur. Martin, J. A vendee who suffers property to remain inthe possession of the vendor, cannot resist the claim of a subsequentbonajida purchaser. And whether the indenture be considered asadeed of mortgage, as we conceive it really is, or as a deed ofsale, as the plaintiff contends, it appears to us, the judge wasequally correct in rejecting his claim, on account of the absenceof the record of the mortgage in this state. A purchaser is notaffected by a mortgage on property executed out of the state,unless it be recorded therein.2.DABNEY et al. v. GREEN. April T. 1809. 4 Hen. & Munf. 100.;ROBERTSON v.

Spring T. 1822. 1 Little s Rep.317.Palmer mortgaged two slaves to Hughes, Fanny and Esther. The chileafterwards sold Fanny to Walker, and he also sold Esther f e r ^,f ato Graves. The mortgage debt not being paid, Hughes filed 8l * d morta bill against Palmer, Walker, and Graves. Walker, in his born afteranswer, admitted that he purchased Fanny ; but averred it was liwithout notice of the mortgage. The court pronounced a decreedirecting the sale of Fanny. Hughes filed a supplemental bill, muchiiable11 .to the de-statingthe proceedings on the former bill, and wavering, that mandoftheEsther, when purchased by Graves, was of little or no value, andsoon after died ; and that Fanny, subsequent to the execution of herself,the mortgage, had two children, which were claimed by, and inthe possession of Walker, and prays that they may be deliveredup to satisfy the balance of the mortgage debt. But the court decreedthat Graves, the purchaser of Esther, should pay the balanceof the mortgage debt.Per Cur. There can be no doubt but the slave Fanny wasliable to the mortgage. Walker having been a purchaser withoutnotice, in fact, of the mortgage, is an immaterial circumstance.For the mortgage having been duly recorded, the law will presumenotice. Besides, the legal title was by the mortgage vestedin Hughes, and the want of notice only protects a purchaser againsta latent equity, and not against the legal title. Nor can there beany doubt but that the children of Fanny, born after the executionof the mortgage, are as much liable as Fanny herself; for itis a settled rule, that the offspring belongs to the owner of themother, partus sequitur ventrem being a maxim of the civil law.7.TURNBULL v.

The bill states, that Green, being indebted to Sadler,on the 7th of March, 1778, executed a deed to him for six negroes,to secure the payment of the debt, and that Sadler executed at thesame time a deference, whereby he agreed that, on payment of126, 1 Is., (the debt before mentioned,) in three years, the rightof Sadler to the slaves should cease. That Green was to keeppossession of the slaves, paying interest on his debt, for whichGreen at different times gave his notes, under the name of hire forthe slaves. That Green being absent from his home for a shorttime on business, in December, 1789, Sadler took out an attachmenton his estate, which was levied on these negroes. Judgmentin the attachment suit was obtained against Green, and the slavessold under an execution issued upon that judgment ; and thatthey were all purchased by Sadler for 159. The object of thebill is to set aside the sale and redeem the negroes. The defendantsadmit that Green was indebted to Sadler at the time he executedthe bill of sale, which they insist was an absolute conveyanceand transfer of the property both at law and in equity. Theythen proceed to state, by way of defensive allegation, that Green,before suing out the attachment, had absolutely absconded, andwas on board a vessel with the negroes, and other effects, sixmiles from his home, when he was overtaken by the deputy sheriff,in a calm, who levied the attachment on the slaves. This fact isproved by the testimony of two witnesses ; one of whom (thedeputy sheriff) says, that Green, after some conversation, observed,that if there had not been an unlucky calm, he should have beenfar enough out of reach ; and thinks he said he should have beenin Carolina. That the bill of sale given by Green for the negroes,was intended only as a security for his debt to Sadler, and not asan absolute conveyance, or even a conditional sale, is, I think,OF MORTGAGE OF SLAVES. 169obvious, not only from the papers themselves, but from the admissionin the answers, that there was a. previous debt due from Greento Sadler, which distinguishes it from the case of Chapman v. Turner,1 Call s Rep. 280. ; and brings it within those of Ross v. Nor-well,1 Wash. Rep. 14. ; and Robertson v. Campbell and Wheeler,2 Call s Rep. 424. I consider the original transaction between theparties, therefore, merely as a mortgage ; and I hold, that if acreditor by bond, or other legal right which he is enabled to prosecutewith effect at law, obtains from his debtor a mortgage bywayof security for the same, and then prosecutes a suit at commonlaw, and having obtained judgment for his debt, levies the executionupon the mortgaged property, which is sold by the sheriff,and purchased by the creditor, the debtor s right to redeem is notextinguished by this proceeding at law, but his equity of redemptioncontinues as fully and completely as before the execution waslevied, or the judgment obtained. And this upon principle ; forthe creditor having accepted of the security for his debt, is bound byevery condition that a court of equity might impose upon him ; norcan he by his own act absolve himself from any such equitableobligation.The case of Lord Cranston v Johnson, 3 Ves. jun. 170., is amuch stronger case than the one I have put ; and shows that acreditor purchasing property, sold under execution to pay his owndebt, may, under circumstances, be considered as holding the sameonly as security for his debt, and the charges he has been put to.But there are several features in this transaction which give to thisparticular case a very different complexion. Green is proved tohave absconded fraudulently with his family and property, amongwhich were, or a considerable part of these slaves, and had actuallyembarked on board a vessel, and proceeded some distance on his wayto another state, or some other quarter of this state, where he couldconceal himself and his property from the very creditor to whom hehad pledged it as a security. One of the soundest maxims of equity is,that he who hath committed iniquity, shall not have equity. Francis*Max. 2. ; that is, as explained by Fonblanque, b. I.e. 2. s. 13, note(p,) where such person is, as in the present case, plaintiff, Willing-hamv. Joyce, 3 Ves. jun. 168., is not so strong a case asthis ; for here the present plaintiff did all in his power to defraudhis creditor. The latter was driven to seek redress at law.Whether the proceedings in the cause were regular or erroneous,cannot be inquired into in a collateral way. The judgment must170 SLAVERY.be taken to be right, the sale lawful, and the purchase by the creditorthe same as the purchase by any other person. The fraud ofGreen has utterly deprived him of the aid of a court of equity, whichought never to interpose to deprive a fair creditor, as Sadler was,of a legal advantage, gained in a due course of law, in consequenceof a most flagrant attempt on the part of the debtor to defraud him.The staleness of the claim, postponed till after Sadler s death, andbarred at law by the act of limitations, furnishes additional reasonsin support of this opinion. The other judges concurred inthis opinion.9.FIELD v. BEELER et al. Spring T. 1813. 3 Bibb s Rep. 18.Who to be Held by the Court, Boyle, Ch.

Rep. 14. ; YOUNG v.WISEMAN, 7 Monroe s Rep. 270.; MIMS v. MIMS, 3 J. J.Marshall s Rep. 103.The facts of the case appeared to be these : Macy advanced The Possessionofmoney to Fen wick in 1807, on the sale of three slaves, which Fen a mortgagingretained at hire. In June, 1822, Fenwick filed a bill, in mortgagorwhich he claimed his right to redeem the slaves, on the ground ^^bl^isthat the contract between him and Macy should be regarded as a unaffectedmortgage. The executors of Macy insisted upon the lapse of u te of limitingin bar of relief. The court below held, that the contract ofsale being intended only as security for the advance of money, the be g ns tosale was to be treated as a mortgage, and dismissed Fenwick s bill the amicusthe ground, that as five years adverse possession was a legal s \o^ 3 ssebar to the recovery of a slave in an action at law, the chancellor clan p d toan adversusadopt the same rule and apply it to bar the mortgagor s ry one, andequity of redemption, after the mortgagee had been in possession possessionfive years. The statute of limitations would furnish the rule, and ued^T^"would be applied by the chancellor. years it isPer Cur. Underwood, J. Upon the principle of conforming to tohave 6the statute of limitations, the chancellor should, where slaves are verse a fromadversely held by a mortgagee for more than five years, refuse a tl ? e be s in -redemption when applied for by the mortgagor. To put a strongcase ; if possession of a slave be with the mortgagee, and he wereto notify the mortgagor that his right to redeem was denied, andthat the mortgagee held the slaves in his own right, free from incumbrance,the chancellor would give no relief after five yearsacquiescence on the part of the mortgagor, in the possession ofthe mortgagee under such circumstances. If he did, it wouldoutrage the policy of the legislature as manifested by the statute.The right which a mortgagor of a slave has to redeem, may thereforedepend upon the nature and character of the possession held bythe mortgagee. If the possession be adverse, he must seek hisremedy within five years. If it be not adverse, he may have twentyyears to redeem, and no longer. Why not a longer time, whenthe possession is not adverse 1 Because, after twenty years, theequity is stale, and the presumption is strong that the mortgageddebt is satisfied, and good policy requires that things long acquiescedin, should not be disturbed on account of the difficulty ofreaching the whole truth.172 SLAVERY.Per Robertson, Ch. J. The character of the thing mortgaged,whether it be a slave or land, cannot affect the dignity of themortgage itself. The equity of redemption, being a right exclusivelywithin the cognisance of the chancellor, does not comewithin the operation of any statutory limitation. But policy andjustice require, that all equitable claims should be asserted in areasonable and convenient time. Twenty years have been designatedby chancery practice as the proper time within whichrights, purely equitable, should be asserted, and beyond which, thechancellor should not, generally, hear an application for relief.In Hovenden v. Lord Amnesty, 2 Sci. & Les. 637., Lord Pedestalsaid, that, "every new right of action in equity that accruesto the party must be acted upon, at the utmost, within twentyyears." This must be understood, with the implied qualification,that there has been no intermediate disability or recognition.A mortgagor or mortgagee in possession under the mortgage,holds as mortgagor or mortgagee, and not adversely, the one to theother. As long as he so holds, the statute of limitations does not,even as to the legal right, commence running ; and it will notcommence at law until the amicable possession shall have becomeadverse. But if either the mortgagor or mortgagee be permittedto remain in possession for twenty years, without any recognition,express or implied, of the existence of the debt, there should afterwardsbe no eviction, foreclosure, or redemption, against the willof the party so continuing in possession. The law will not presumethat such a possession, thus long continued, had been amicable,but will consider it, after the end of twenty years, to havebeen adverse from the beginning, or from the time when themortgage debt was due, unless some opposing facts interfere.The payment of the debt will be presumed, and nothing appearingto the contrary, the presumption will be, that it was paid when itbecame due, and that, of course, the possession, from that timewas adverse, and not in the character of mortgagor and mortgagee.Hence, if the mortgagee bring an ejectment against the mortgagor,after such unqualified possession of twenty years, the statute of limitationsmay bar the action ; and if he filed his bill to foreclose, hemay be barred, not only in analogy to the statute of limitations, butbecause his claim has become too stale and questionable to justifyan enforcement of it in equity. The same principles apply to themortgagor s equity of redemption, after a continued possession bythe mortgagee for twenty years. But if, within twenty years,OF MORTGAGE OF SLAVES. 173there shall have been any acknowledgment of the subsistence ofthe debt, or of a holding under the mortgage, the lapse of timemay not operate as a bar at law or in equity.If a slave be mortgaged, less than twenty years will not bar theequity of the mortgagor, or the right of the mortgagee, unless theparty in possession shall have shown clearly that he disclaimedholding under the mortgage, and had held independently of it, andadversely to the right of the other party to it. In less than twentyyears neither law nor equity will presume a transmutation of the possession,from its original and amicable, into an inconsistent and hostilenature. The right to redeem a mortgaged slave is precisely thesame as the equity of redemption in land. It is the creature ofequity, and is nothing but equity. And therefore the statute of limitationsdoes not apply to it ; but the right to redeem may continuefor twenty years to exist ; and indeed, facts may have intervenedwhich may extend it beyond twenty years, just as if the thingmortgaged had been land. But as soon as the mortgagee shall renouncehis mortgage, and assert an absolute and indefeasible rightto the slave, independently of the mortgage, the relation ofmortgagor and mortgagee will cease to exist, and the statute oflimitations will, of course, eo instant, commence running ; and,consequently, such an adversary holding for five years wouldbe a legal bar for restitution, and should equally bar the equity ofredemption ; for in such case the equitable light would correspondwith the legal right, and five years adversary possession wouldhave vested title absolutely in the holder.

Rep. 126.Parol evil The complainant alleged in his bill, that he borrowed money ofthe defendant, and made a bill of sale of his slave, under the untoprove understanding and agreement that the slave should be returned inthat an absolutebill one month after. The answer relied on the bill of sale being abosale for -,a slave was Collate.intended And the quest i O n was, whether the bill of sale for the slave wastor a mortgage.intended to be a sale, or whether it was a mortgage.Per Cur. Mills, J. The question must rest on the inquiry,whether, under the circumstances of the case, the parol proof ofwhat was the real contract between the parties, or whether parolproof, changing the absolute transfer into a mortgage, is admissible.Such proof has been admitted to enable the court of chancery to decidebetween a mortgage and conditional sale ; and instances maynot be wanting of such proof being admitted to convert absolutesales into mortgages ; but whether the admission of such proofcan be sustained upon principle, is an inquiry worthy of our attention.That such proof is admissible in cases where it is firstshown that the deed or writing was drawn different from whatwas intended, by mistake or fraud, or was executed under circumstanceswhere the free agency of the grantor was controlled, orwhere it is usurious, as the statute against usury admits of suchproof, or under any previous circumstance which may legitimatelylay a foundation for or open the door to such testimony, cannotbe doubted ; but whether it is admissible in every case, and maybeused to add to, or insert a condition in an absolute deed, byshowing that such was the agreement and understanding at thetime of its execution, but not inserted in the writing, is a differentquestion. Upon examining the authorities on this subject, wefind them not consistent with each other ; for although most ofthem recognize the general principle that parol evidence is notadmissible to vary the written contract, yet courts have made somany exceptions to the rule, that they have, if all the cases are tobe sustained, pared down the rule itself to scarcely the rank of anexception. Parol evidence in this case cannot be admitted.OF MORTGAGE OF SLAVES 17515.ENGLISH v.

In March, pledged to1800, Taylor borrowed of William Holliday, the defendant, one paymentshundred pounds, and to secure the payment, executed a deed of rowed, shesale in the usual form, to which the following clause was added : pledgee isliable in The conditions of the above bill of sale is such, that if the summit forsaid Henry Taylor, his heirs, executors or administrators, dothand shall, well and truly pay to the said William Holliday, or hisheirs, on or before the 25th day of December next, the sum of thedebtthetwo hundred dollars, then the above bill of sale to be null and void, sin beingotherwise to remain in full force until the said Taylor doth pay paidthe sum of two hundred dollars. Signed, sealed, and delivered,the day and year first above written."HENRY TAYLOR, Seal.< ; Test. Titus Car."Taylor died in April, 1800. His will was duly proved, andMicah Edwards, the executor therein named, qualified in thesame month. The plaintiff intermarried with the legatee, Lucy,in April, 1801 ; and upon the marriage, the executor of Taylorassented to the legacy of the negro Harry to the plaintiff. The176 SLAVERY.negro Harry remained in the possession of the defendant, fromMarch, 1800, until April, 1803, and is worth thirty pounds a year.In April, 1803, the plaintiff paid Holliday, (for which the negrowas pledged,) two hundred dollars, and the negro was deliveredto him. He then demanded satisfaction for the services of the negro,which the defendant refused to make. Upon this case theplaintiff brings his action, and declares ;1. For the wages of the negro, from the death of Henry Taylor,to the surrender by defendant in April, 1803.2. For many had and received by defendant to plaintiff s use,for the excess of what was paid defendant more than was due ofthe sum lent, allowing the wages of the negro annually to diminishthe debt and interest. The jury, under the charge of the court,found a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of forty-eightpounds, estimated as the wages of the negro from the time ofplaintiff s marriage with Lucy, the legatee, until the delivery inApril, 1803, deducting the interest of the sum borrowed for thesame term. It is submitted to the opinion of the supreme court,whether the said verdict shall stand.Per Cur. Taylor, Ch. J. It has been the uniform practice ofthe courts of equity in this state, to make a mortgagee in possession,account for the rents and profits, upon a bill filed for redemption.This is a necessary consequence of the principles which prevail inthose courts relative to a mortgage, which is considered only as asecurity for money lent, and the mortgagee a trustee of the mortgagor.To sanction an opposite doctrine even in the cases ofpledges, where the profits exceed the interest of the money lent,would be to furnish facilities for the evasion of the statute againstusury, almost amounting to a repeal of that salutary law. Nothingcan come more completely within the legal notion of a pledge,than the slave held by Holliday in the present case ; for, by thevery terms of the contract, it was so to continue until the moneyshould be paid, no legal property vesting in Holliday, who had onlya lien upon it to secure his debt. All the profits, therefore, exceedingthe interest of his debt, he received to the plaintiff s use,and cannot conscientiously withhold. Wherever a man receivesmoney belonging to another, without any valuable considerationgiven, the law implies that the person receiving, promised to accountfor it to the true owner ; and the breach of such implied undertaking,is to be compensated for in the present form of action, whichis, according to Mr. Justice Blackstone, " a very extensive andOF MORTGAGE OF SLAVES. Mlbeneficial remedy, applicable to almost every case where a personhas received money, which ex quo et bono, he ought to refund.Nor is its application to a case like the present without authority fromdirect adjudication. The case of Ashley v. Reynolds, in Strange,915., furnishes an instance of a man s being allowed to receive thesurplus which he had paid beyond legal interest, in order to getpossession of goods which he had pledged. In principle, the casesare the same ; the only thing in which they differ is, that in the casebefore us, the money was received by the defendant from the laborof the pledge ; in the other, it was paid by the plaintiffs. Wetherefore think the plaintiff is entitled to judgment.17.WOLF v. O Harrel. Nov. T. 1812. Constitutional CourtRep. 151.This was a motion to set aside a nonsuit ordered on the ground A mortgagea failure of necessary evidence to maintain the action. The s i a ve mayaction was trover, for the conversion of a negro slave.The plaintiff s claim was founded on an instrument of writing: tertheoon-. . dition ofcontaining a conditional contract of sale by the owner of the slave, the mort-snell,to the plaintiff, by way of mortgage, to secure the pay broken.ment of a sum of money lent by the plaintiff to Snell.By the terms of the contract, the slave was to remain in Snell spossession until the day of payment, when, if the money was notpaid, with interest, it should be lawful for the plaintiff to take possessionof, and sell the slave in satisfaction of the debt. But ifthe debt was satisfied at the day, the sale should be void. Thewriting was not sealed, but only signed by Snell. It was statedthat the debt was unsatisfied after the day appointed for the paymentthereof ; and the plaintiff contends, that by the legal operationof the contract, the mortgagee became proprietor of the slave,liable to the equity of redemption. Upon this statement, thepaper was offered in evidence to prove property in the plaintiff,and was rejected by the court ; in consequence of which the nonsuitwas ordered.JVoM, J. This was an action of trover, to recover a negro slave,tried before judge Smith, at Orangeburgh. The plaintiff hadtaken a mortgage of the negro in question from one Snell, redeemableupon the payment of a certain sum of money, on a futureday. Snell continued in the possession of the negro, and previousto the day of payment, sold him to the defendant. The presiding178 SLAVERY.judge granted a nonsuit, on the ground that the mortgage did notvest such a legal right in the plaintiff as entitled him to maintainthis action. I am, however, of opinion, that such a right did vestin him, and therefore the nonsuit ought to be set aside. Everymortgage, prima facie, conveys a legal right to become void, on acondition subsequent, which it is incumbent on the mortgagor toprove. Whether the want of delivery, or any circumstances attendingthe transaction, afforded such presumption, or evidence offraud, as would prevent the plaintiff from recovering on the merits,should have been submitted to the jury, but could not have beentaken advantage of by way of nonsuit. The motion, therefore,ought to be granted.Colcock, J. On the argument of this case I was inclined tothink that the opinion of the court below was correct, and thatthe mortgage should not have been given in evidence. But, onfarther consideration, I am induced to think a mortgagee maymaintain his action of trover against a third person.In England, the mortgagee may maintain his action even againstthe mortgagor. Such v. Hall, Doug. Rep. 22. ; Birch v. Wright,1 Term Rep. 382. 3. And after the stat. 4th of Ann, which doesaway the necessity of attornment, he may maintain his action ordistress for rent against a tenant. Mors v. Baltimore, Doug. Rep.279. But by our act of assembly, the right of the mortgagee tomaintain ejectment against the mortgagor is taken away. Vol. 1.p. 65. It appears to me, if this remedy is not given, that themortgages of personal property would be wholly ineffectual. Inthe case of Atkinson v. Making and others, 2 T. Rep. 462., theship, which was recovered by the plaintiff, was at sea when mortgaged,and, of course, no delivery could be made. It seems to beconceded, that the mortgagee is considered as being in possessionfrom the execution and delivery of the mortgage, in the same mannerthat the assigns of a bankrupt are considered to be in possessionof the goods of the bankrupt assignee, and may maintain trover forthe recovery of them. 7 Term. Rep. 312. The mortgagee is theabsolute and true owner. 3 C ranch s Rep. 140. 144. Ryall v.Bowles, 1 Ves. I am, upon these authorities, and for these reasonsof opinion, that the motion be granted.Say, J. Upon the argument of this case, I was rather inclinedto think, that the right of property was not absolute in the mortgageetill after a foreclosure, or a sale under the mortgage, whichin this country has been considered as tantamount to a foreclosure.But upon reconsidering this case, I am now very clearly of opinion,OF MORTGAGE OF SLAVES. 179that upon failure of payment of the money, or performance of thecondition in the mortgage, the property becomes absolute in themortgagee. Before the failure of payment of the money mentionedin the proviso, the legal estate is still in the mortgagor, and 01 lya conditional one in the mortgagee. But after failure of paymentof the money, it is no longer conditional in the mortgagee, but absolute; and is gone in law from the mortgagor forever ; subject,however, in equity, at any time before foreclosure, to the right ofredemption, upon payment of principal and interest of the mortgagemoney. 2 Black. Com. 158.; 3 Ba. Abr. Tit. Mortgage, 635.Taking it then for granted, that the property is absolute in themortgagee after failure, it follows as a natural consequence, thathe may pursue his property wheresoever he can find it ; for theright of property gives the right of remedy, and he may take it outof the possession of the mortgagor himself, or out of the possessionof any other person who may have it by transfer or sale, if he canprocure such possession peaceably ; or, upon demand and refusal,may maintain an action of trover for it ; for he who has the firstmortgage shall prevail over all other mortgages or conveyanceswhatever. Eq. Cas. Ab. 320.; 3 Bac. Abr. 642.The civil law is very full upon this right of the creditor, to pursuethe thing mortgaged in the hands of any person in whose possessionit may be found. 1 Domat, 343. &c. And the commonlaw in this respect is borrowed from the civil law. It has beenthe custom, from time immemorial, in this country, for the mortgagee,after failure of payment of the money mentioned in theproviso, to seize the negroes, or other chattels, and, after dulyadvertising, to sell them towards payment and satisfaction of thedebt.And, indeed, this custom seems to have given rise to the commoncovenant in almost every mortgage deed, to empower themortgagee to seize and sell, and to return the overplus, if any, tothe mortgagor, which, in fact, is only a declaration of the commonlaw right which would exist without it. And, although it is usualand common to put such mortgages into the hands of the sheriff,to seize and sell, yet he only acts as the agent of the mortgagees,and not in his official capacity of sheriff. This custom, however,is a very commendable one, as the sheriff of a district is alwayssupposed to be highly trustworthy, and a very proper person toconduct such sales. Upon the whole, I am of opinion that thenon-suit should be set aside, and a new trial granted. The otherjudges concurred.180 SLAVERY.18.HOPKINS v.

Munf. 23.Declaration in detinue for slave by the executor of the testator, Wherewhose widow is the defendant. The widow was possessed of the widowslaves, as her thirds of the slaves of her former husband ; and slaves asbeing so possessed, the plaintiff s testator married her, and died. ^^Te"And the question was, whether a widow holding slaves in dower, cont hus -and marrying again, thereby vests them in her second husband, so slaves be-thatupon his death they go to his representatives, or whether sheshall have them for the residue of her life. The county court ^? nd andgave judgment for the plaintiff; and on appeal, the judgment was tentativereversed by the district court, and the plaintiff appealed to this death. 6court.The president delivered the opinion of the court, consisting ofjudges Fleming, Roanee, Cabell and Coalter, that the judgment ofthe district court be reversed, and that of the county courtaffirmed.Slaves are subject to dower in all the states. Not only are they subject to dower,but the widow s interest in them is protected by statutory provisions. If the husbandmanumits his slaves, whereby creditors and the dower of the widow are affected,the manumission is so far ineffectual, that the manumitted slaves may be sold for aperiod, and the proceeds of the sale applied to the creditors of the former owner andhis widow. By the Rev. Code of Virgg. vol. 1 p. 435., it is declared, that the right ofthe widow to the dower of slaves emancipated by the husband s will, are saved if sherenounce under the will. So, also, the rights of the creditors of the person emancipatingare saved. And by the Rev. Code of Mississippi, p. 385, 75., it is declared,that slaves emancipated are subject to the right of dower of the widow, and are madeliable to execution for the previous debts of the owner. And similar provisions existin the statutes of the other states. Civil Code of Louisiana, art, 190. ; 2 Litt. andSwi. 1155.; 2Brev.

Craig and Wife, 6 Monroe s Rep. 256. In thatcase the court decided, that the wife s estate in slaves held as dowerfrom a former husband, at the time of her marriage with a succeedinghusband, vests absolutely in the latter during their jointlives ; and in the event of her surviving him, goes, during her life,to his personal representatives. They are assets in the hands ofthe husband s representatives, if he should die before his wife.Slaves held in right of dower vest in the second husband, and do notsurvive to the surviving wife, but vest in the representatives of the.second husband during the life of the widow, subject only to herright of dower, as part of her husband s estate. And see Fightmas-ter et al. v. Beastly, 7 J. J. Marshall s Rep. 410. The court saidthat the interest of a wife in the devise of a slave vests absolutelyin the husband.3.THRIFT v. HANNAH et al.

In November, 1799,Rachel Magruder married Thrift, having the negroes in her possession,who was ignorant of the deed of emancipation. Thriftand his wife moved into another county, taking the negroes withthem, and holding them as slaves. Mrs. Magruder died in 1811.In 1819 the instrument of emancipation was fully proved. Thehusband holding the negroes in his possession as slaves, this suitOF THE DIVISION OF SLAVES. 183was commenced. Verdict for plaintiffs ; and Thrift appealed to theCircuit Court of Albemarle, which affirmed the judgment, and heappealed to this court.The court held, that under the statute, an instrument of emancipationis ineffectual to confer freedom till full probate be made,and takes effect from that act. And in this case, as the rights ofthe husband attached to the property before the probate, the subsequentfull probate did not relate back and divest or effect thoserights.Per Cabell, J. By the marriage of Rachel Magruder in thiscase, she ceased to be the owner of the slaves, which thereby becamethe property of her husband ; and that event happened beforethe proof of the instrument ; and, of course, before it hadtaken effect as an instrument of emancipation, it could not takeeffect afterwards, since none but the owner of the slaves can emancipatethem.(XI.)

After his decease, version orremainder,Rachel intermarried with Banks, and had children, of whom the and mar-plaintiffwas one. Rachel died, and afterwards, the donor, herfather, died, and the plaintiff, one of the children of Rachel, tookout letters of administration upon her estate, and commenced this lar estate,suit. The court held, the administrator of Rachel had no right to the slavesrecover; that the property in the issue of the negro Pen vestedin the husband on the marriage ; and the plaintiff appealed to this or of them.court.186 SLAVERY.Held by the court, that slaves, while in the possession of thetenant for life of them, are not choses in action of the reversionerin fee, because the possession of tenant for life is not adverse to,- but consistent with his title. Rachel had, in fact, the general, andthe donor only a special property in the slaves. The right to theslaves in question survived to the husband of Rachel, and, of course,the plaintiff in the circuit court showed no right to maintain theaction. From an attentive examination of the cases, the clear resultfrom all of them seems to be, that if a feme sole be entitled toslaves in remainder or reversion, and marry before the determinationof the particular estate, the right will go to the husband or thewife, as the one or the other may survive. And according to thatdoctrine, it is obvious, as the husband survived in this case, theright to the slaves in question must belong to him. Judgmentaffirmed.6.BELL & WIFE v. HOGAN.

Two ofthe testator s children released to their sister Elizabeth. Theplaintiff s wife being one of the children, Elizabeth, the devisee,died without ever having had any children.The court charged the jury, that the bequest to Elizabeth wasa limitation over, after an indefinite failure of issue, and thereforevoid ; that the limitation over being void, the first legatee took anabsolute estate ; that if said Elizabeth was entitled only to a lifeestate, that then, at her death, the property in the slaves would revertback, and sink into the residuum of the testator s estate undisposedof by his will. Plaintiffs excepted.Per Cur. Lipscomb, Ch. J. It is a rule of law, that a limitationOF REMAINDER IN SLAVES. 187over to another, after an indefinite failure of heirs, is bad, becauseit is too remote. If the testator in the case under considerationmeant, in his limitation over to the plaintiff, and her brothers, thatit should not take effect until there had been an indefinite failureof heirs, we cannot carry his intention into effect ; and the chargeof the court was correct, that it was too remote, and that Elizabeth,the first taker, took an absolute estate. But if we are authorized,from the terms of the bequest, to believe that an indefinite failureof heirs was not meant, and that by " failure of heirs," he meantheirs of a particular kind, then his intention is not opposed by therule of law, and should be carried into effect. This limitation was nottoo remote, because it was to take effect, if at all, at the death of thefirst taker. And the court referred to Peek v. Patten, 2 D. &E. 721.; Porter v. Bradley, 3 D. & E. 143.; Wilkinson v. South,7 D. & E. 551.; Sheers v. Jeffries, 7 D. & E. 585.7.BETTY v. MOORE. Spring T. 1833. 1 Dana s Rep. 235.Suit for freedom.

The judgment must be reversed. At common law, ^J d operagift to a man and the heirs of his body was an estate upon con ty vests indition, that it should revert to the donor, if the donee had no heirs taker.of his body ; but if he had, that it should remain to the donee. Itwas therefore called a fee simple, on condition that he had issue.2 Black. Com. 110. The statute de dons afterwards turned thisestate upon condition, when it created the conveyance of realestate into/ee tail. As to personalty, it still remains a fee on condition.According to the earlier decisions, while chattels were oflittle estimation, a grant of personalty for life carried with it thewhole estate. But the law, as it has been settled in modern times,allows the limitation of a remainder after a life estate in personalty.And it has even been allowed, by executory devise or conveyancein trust, to create what is, to some extent, in effect the same as aconditional fee, or estate tail, in such property, without thereby passingthe absolute and entire interest to the first taker. This, SLAVERY.ever, is expressly confined to two excepted modes of creating anestate in personalty. For it is well settled, that, (with the exceptionof an annuity,) wherever by any of the ordinary modes of- conveyance, an estate in fee conditional or fee tail is granted inor out personalty, that it passes the whole entire to the grantee orfirst taker, and consequently, all further limitations or reservationsare null and void. Co. Lilt. 20. (a) ; Fear. on Cont. Rem. 460.463 ; Roper on Leg. 393. So that, properly speaking, there canbe no such estate in personalty as a fee simple, on condition ofhaving issue, or fee tail, but all such estates, when attempted to hecreated, carry the whole interest.8.SMITH v.

Lessee, the son, assigned to the plaintiff all hisclaim and interest in the personal estate of his father after thedeath of the widow. The chancellor dismissed the bill.Per Cur. Catron, J. The decree must be affirmed. Wherethe first taker has an absolute estate in the property devised, thenthe limitation over is void, being inconsistent with the interestgiven to the first taker.9.HIGGINBOTHAM v. RucKER.

Thus a limitation to a person in issue forlife, after dying without issue is good, because the contingency musthappen, if at all, in the life time of the remainderman ; and the limitationto him for life, restrains the generality of the words, " dyingwithout issue ;" otherwise the limitation over would be void.See Dunn v.

Cameron & Norwood s North CarolinaRep. 353.Thomas Cunningham, in September, 1792, duly made his last A slave *n j . cannotholdwill and testament, by which, amongst other things, he devised as propertyfollows: "It is my will and desire, that five feet of an alley be by devisleft from Front street to low water mark, as convenient as may beto after bequeathed lot, then I will and desire that forty feet backincluding the house where Mr. Potts is now resident, be, at the expirationof the lease, rented out for the maintenance of a negrowoman of mine, named Rachel, and the maintenance and educationof her three mulatto children, named Mary, Ritfy, and Christy,and the child of which she is now pregnant." After devisingpart of a lot to Edmund Robeson, the will proceeds thus : " andthe rest and residue of the said lot to be rented yearly for the mainte-slavescannot take property by devise, descent, or purchase, as was stated. Seeante, p. 6. It is a general principle, and prevailed in the Spanish, Portuguese, andBritish West Indies, before the late act of emancipation. See Stephens on Slavery,&c. vol 1. p. 46, 47. ; 17 Miles Reg. p. 200. And see a pamphlet published by RobertWalsh; Jr., Philad. ; Holmes Annals, No. 1.192 SLAVERY.nance of Rachel and her three children already named, with thechild of which she is now pregnant; with all the rest of the land lyingbetween Lee s Creek and Deep Inlet Creek, between Racheland her three children, share and share alike, to them and theirheirs.Item. I will and desire that my negro men, Virgil and Quash,together with my negro woman Tamer, should live on the plantationwhere I now reside, on Lee s Creek, to work for the maintenanceof Rachel s children, during the natural life of said negroes.Item. I will and desire that Rachel and her children should be setfree immediately after my decease."The defendant, as executor of Thomas Cunningham, the testator,took possession of that part of the real estate, the rents ofwhich are directed by the will to be applied towards the maintenanceand education of the negro woman Rachel and her children.For this part of the estate, the action was brought. Rachel andall her children, before, and at the time of making the will, andever since, have been slaves.Hall, J. I think that the devise in question is void, and cannottake effect. The maintenance and education of some of the devisees,is what the testator appears to have been anxious for. Howcan it be effected ? They are slaves, and their owners have a rightto them and their services ; if they are educated, it must be by hispermission, and if it is attempted without, it is a violation of hisright. If this property had been conveyed in trust for the samepurpose, a performance of the trust could not be compelled in acourt of equity, for the same reason. Admit that they couldbring a suit to recover this property, could they have a right toenjoy it ? Suppose the owner took it from them, would they havea remedy against him ? They certainly would not.Taylor, J. The intention of the testator seems plainly to havebeen, to transfer the beneficial interest in the lands, to Rachel andher children ; and were there no legal impediments to the effectingof such an object, I should think the words made use of equivalentto an express devise of the land. But it is indispensable to thevalidity of every devise, that there be a devisee appointed who iscompetent to take. Slaves have not that competence ; for a civilincapacity results from the nature and condition of slavery. Andit would be a solecism, that the law should sanction or permit theacquisition of property by those from whom it afterwards with-incapacityOF SLAVES. 193holds that protection without which property is useless. From thisprinciple an important difference arises between slavery, as it isestablished in this state, and the condition of villeinage, as it existedin England, prior to the statute Car. 2. A villein might bringan action against any person who did him an injury, except hislord ; and even against him in some particular cases. If, therefore,he purchased land, although the lord might enter upon it,and seize it to his own use ; yet while he permitted the villein tohold, the land would descend to the children of the latter, in aregular course of descent, and the law, while it furnished themwith a remedy against any who should disturb their possession,also gave them, in time, a title by prescription against their lords.A villein might also lawfully dispose of what he had acquired, ifhe completed the transfer before his lord made seizure.In all these instances, the characteristics of slavery are different; for a slave can bring no action ; he can neither acquire nortransfer property, by descent or purchase ; nor will prescriptionavail him, to assert a title against his master. The devise cannot,therefore, in the present case, operate any thing.Judges Johnson and Macy concurred.Judgment for the plaintiff.(C.) To BE A WITNESS.*1.Going v. Devant. Feb.

See the cases in the text. In many of the states,legislative provision is made upon the subject. In Virginia, by an act of Assembly it isdeclared, " any negro or mulatto, bond or free, shall be a good witness in pleas of thecommonwealth, for or against negroes or mulattoes, bond or free ; or in civil pleaswhere free negroes or mulattoes shall alone be parties, and in no other cases whatsoever.1 Rev. V. C. 422. 3 Hen. stat. at large, 298. And similar provisions are madein Mississippi. See Rev Code, 372.; Litt. & Swi, 1150. So in Alabama, Holman sDig. 627., and in Missouri, 2 Missouri laws, 600. In Maryland, see the act of 1717.And in North Carolina, by the act of 1777. ch. 242. And in South Carolina. 2 Rewards Dig. 242. But the rule does not extend to cases where the parties are negroesor slaves. A slave may be a witness against a slave, and even against a free person ofcolor in some eases. See, in addition to the cases in the text, 1 Rev. Code of Virginia422.; Prince s Dig. 446.; Hay wood s Manual 523,; Maryland laws of 1751. chap. 144. The principle of exclusion is grounded on the degraded state of the slave, andthe interest which he may have to conceal or deny the truth. This rule prevailsin all countries where slavery is tolerated. It existed in the British West Indies beforethe late act of emancipation. See Njles Reg. vol. 26.; Stephens West Indian Slavery,&c. p. 168. And prevails, as was before observed, in all the states where slaveryexists.It may be stated as a principle, that in all countries where slavery exists, and wherethe rules of the civil law have been adopted ; and they have been in the Spanish, Portuguese,and British West Indies ; and in the several states of the United States, whereit is permitted, a slave cannot be a witness for or against a white person in a civil orcriminal case. Stephens on West Indian Slavery, &c. p. 168, 169. Dulany s opinion, 1liar. & M Hen. Rep. 561. This principle has been adopted in all the states, even whereno enactments are to be found declaring them incompetent witnesses. It may betermed the common law or custom, on account of the universality of its operation.In some of the states the evidence or testimony of free Indians and slaves is admitted,without oath, for or against any other slave accused of any crime or offence.This is specially enacted in South Carolina. 2 Brevard s Dig. 232.; and the same re -relation may be found in the laws of Georgia, James Dig. In Virginia, 1 Rev. Code,422. In North Carolina & Tennessee, Haywood s Manual, 522. And also in Kentucky,2 Litt. & Swi. 1150.; and Mississippi Rev. Code, 382. And see Stroud sSketch of Slavery in the several states, p. 126,INCAPACITY OF SLAVES. 195Per Cur. Colcock, J. The court are unanimously of opinion,that the witness was properly rejected. There is no instance inwhich a negro has been permitted to give evidence, except in casesof absolute necessity ; nor indeed has this court ever recognized thepropriety of admitting them in any case where the rights of whitepersons are concerned. When we consider the degraded state inwhich they are placed by the laws of the state, and the ignorancein which most of them are reared, it would be unreasonable, aswell as impolitic, to lay it down as a general rule that they werecompetent witnesses.3.COMMONWEALTH v.

It appeared the slave had belonged to the testator,Sum bailie w ^ Devised ^ m to Walter, his son, and Walter by writing hadgiftofman- manumitted him, by and with the consent of his guardian, being- himself but 18 years of age when the instrument was executed.The defendant still objected, on the ground that the instrument ofcoming of manumission, being executed by an infant, was voidable, and themanumission, therefore, not absolute, but revocable. Verdict fordefendant, and motion for a new trial.Per Cur. The manumission by the infant was voidable whenhe should come of age. The sale, gift, and actual delivery of achattel by an infant is voidable. Perkins, 12. But, in the meantime,the sale, gift, or transfer, is valid, and the interest whichpasses, or is released, thereby vests. The manumission beingvalid, though defeasible afterwards, the witness was not at thetime a slave, and the objection to his competency was not welltaken. He must be a slave at the time, to come within the disqualificationprescribed by the statute. The power which the infanthad of revoking the gift on coming of age, would, no doubt,have a strong and undue bias on the mind of the witness ; but thiswould be an objection only. He could not be set aside on theground of a subsisting slave. New trial granted.7.THE STATE v. FISHER, July T. 1805. 1 Har. & Johns. Rep.750.Mulattoes.

To BE A PARTY IN A SUIT.*1.Beard v. Beard et al. Feb. T. 1836. 9 Louisiana Rep.156.Per Cur. Martin, J. The plaintiff is a person of color, andsues her aunt, Marie Louise Berard, for the purpose of establish in judgingher and her children s claim to their freedom. The defendant any ot herdisavowed any title to the plaintiff; but averred, that she belonged j^n to 6 astonher late sister, Marie Jane Berard, and that she descended to sert hisher sister s natural children, and legal heirs, Celia and Antoine he cannotGarden. These heirs intervened, and claimed the plaintiff and herchildren as their property, in the right of their deceased mother.The case was tried by a jury, who found a verdict for the inter him asevening party, and the plaintiff appealed.The court instructed the jury that the intervenes were notbound to show their title. The plaintiff excepted.On a full consideration of the case, this court is of opinion, thatthe instructions given to the jury by the district judge, was correct.Slaves are themselves considered as property, and can neither take, possess, orretain any, except for the use of their masters. A slave cannot be a party to a suit, exceptin the single case where the negro is held as a slave, and he claims to be free.See the act of South Carolina, 1740.; 2 Brevard s Dig. 229. And the act ofGeorgia, 1770. Prince s Dig. 446. ; Rouleau s Dig. 632. ; 1 Missouri Laws, 404. Andsee the cases abridged, and tit. " Suits for Freedom," post. It would be an idle formand ceremony to make a slave a party to a suit, by the instrumentality of which hecould recover nothing ; or if a recovery could be had, the instant it was recoveredwould belong to the master. The slave can possess nothing ; he can hold nothing.He is, therefore, not a competent party to a suit. And the same rule prevails whereeverslavery is tolerated, whether there be legislative enactments upon the subject ornot.In all cases where the slave alleges he is free, of course he is a party. He mayhave a habeas corpus, and if there be a false return, may sue upon it. Or he may bringtrespass for assault and battery, and false imprisonment, to which action, the defendant,to justify himself, must plead the negro is his slave. In many of the states hemay proceed by petition for freedom. Rebecca Penny v. Mansfield, 4 Hayww. Rep.165. And see tit. " Suits for freedom," ost.198 SLAVERY.A slave cannot stand in judgment for any other purpose than toassert his freedom.

YOUNG. Jan. T. 1821. 9 Martin s Louisiana Rep.221.of a bad Per Cur. Mathew s, J. This is a case in which the plaintiffif^urlued see ^ s to recover damages to the value of a slave, alleged to haveon suspi- been killed by the defendant. The case was submitted to a jury,ony, at who found for the latter, and from the judgment rendered on theseizeVgim verdict, the former appealed. The evidence in the case showskifiedhuhe P r P wert y in ti 16 appellant, and the killing by the appellee. Thepursuit, the only question is, whether the killing took place under circumstancesthat justify it. The testimony which comes^up with therecord is multifarious ; but from it we gather the following facts :for the defendant,who killedhim. * It is stated in Stroud s Sketch of the Laws relating to slavery, p. 35., "that themaster may, at his pleasure, inflict any species of punishment upon the person of hisslave." This proposition, so repugnant to humanity, is equally opposed to the fact,and also to the law. In those states where there are no enactments upon the subject,the common law would be efficient to protect the slave. Our books are full of criminalprosecutions for cruelty to horses and other animals. And the common law remedyis considered effective without any statutory enactment. And if the slave be consideredan animal, still he is under the protection of the law, and acts of inhumanity and crueltyto him, is a public misdemeanor ; and the person guilty may be indicted and punished.MASTERS AND OTHERS LIABILITIES. 201that the slave was in the habit of going at large without a writtenpermission from his master ; that he was of a bad character, andwas killed in the defendant s attempt to arrest him, on a suspicionof his having committed a felony, whilst he was endeavoring toeffect his escape, having attempted to seize a gun. The verdict ofthe jury is general, and decides both the law and facts of the case.It is the opinion of a majority of this court, that the verdict andjudgment are correct.3.JENNINGS v. FUNDEBURG. Jan. T. 1827. 4 M Cord s Rep.161.Trespass for killing the plaintiff s slave. The defendant with Tb excuseothers being in search of runaway negroes, surprised them in their forkedcamp, and fired his gun towards them as they were running away, a slave > "to induce them to stop. One of the negroes, however, was killed accident,by a random shot. peto &P ~The court below thought the killing accidental, and that the defendantought not to be made answerable as a trespasser. The in ou the- 1,1. least faultjury must ensue iron some unauthorized interceding with pro on the partperty, as in the case of Wright v. Gray, 2 Bay s Rep. 214., wherethe defendant prevailed on a negro boy, without the consent of hismaster, to ride a race, and the boy was thrown from his horse andkilled. But when one is lawfully interfering with the property ofanother, and accidentally injures or destroys it, he is no trespasser,and ought not to be answerable for the value of the property. Inthis case the defendant was engaged in a lawful and meritorious service,and if he really fired his gun in the manner stated, it was anallowable act. Verdict for defendant, and the plaintiff appealed.Per Cur. Johnson, J. To excuse a trespass, on the groundthat the injury done was the consequence of an accident, it is notenough that the party did not intend it, but it must appear that itwas unavoidable, and without any the least fault on his part; and thebooks go so far as to say, that, if by any extraordinary degree ofcircumspection, even greater than is ordinarily practised in the affairsof life, he might have guarded against it, he shall be liable.Which is illustrated by the case where soldiers were exercising withmuskets, and in so doing, the defendant, casualties et per unfortunateet contra voluntary sum, in discharging his piece, wounded theplaintiff. The plea was held bad ; for a man shall not be excused202 SLAVERY.of a trespass, except it be committed utterly without his fault.Harm. N. P. 67.

JYott, J., held, there must be a new trial ; that thejury ought to have given the plaintiff the value of the slave. Thatif the jury were of opinion the slave was of bad character, somededuction from the usual price ought to be made, but the plaintiffwas certainly entitled to his actual damage for killing his slave.Where property is in question, the value of the article, as nearlyas it can be ascertained, furnishes a rule from which they are notat liberty to depart. The rule does not apply to actions soundingin damages merely, as slander, &c. ; there the jury are left in agreat measure without any control as to the amount. And seeArthur v. Wells, 2 Const.

Motion granted.6.THE STATE v. E. SMITH AND R. SMITH. Nov. T. 1817. 1Nottt & M Cord s Rep. 13.The defendants were convicted of killing a negro, under the act The penalty1740. P. L. 173. The clause of the act upon which the indict 7 undethe act ofment was predicated, is in these words : " if any person shall on sud 1740, forden heat of passion, or by undue correction, kill his own slave, or negnf, actsthe slave of any other person, he shall forfeit the sum of three Truanthundred pounds current money." Sentence was pronounced not on theby the judge upon the defendants, "that they pay three hundredand fifty pounds old currency." They paid the fine tothe clerk, and took a receipt. After the court had adjourned, thejudge ordered the clerk to amend the minutes so as to make thejudgment be, that each of the defendants should pay the above sum.A rule was taken out to enforce the amended sentence, whichwas made absolute. Motion to reverse the decision.Per Cur. Colcock, J. By the statute, the fine is affixed to theperson, and not to the offence ; and in this conviction, each of thedefendants is found guilty of killing. Many of our acts affix thepenalty to the offence, and say that for every offence the fine shallbe paid. If such had been the language of this act, the constructioncontended for by the prisoners counsel must have followed ;but this act says, every person shall pay for the offence, and not thatso much shall be paid for every offence. It is therefore clear, thateach defendant is bound to pay the sum of three hundred and fiftypounds currency ; and in this construction my brethren concur.7.THE STATE v. RAINES.

TheTRIAL AND PUNISHMENT OF SLAVES. 205court instructed the jury, that whatever rules existed on the subject,were rules of reason and prudence, addressed to their sounddiscretion ; but that there was no positive rule of law which shouldprevent them, if they believed the testimony of the slave, from findinga verdict of guilty against the prisoner, although his testimonywas not supported by other proof. The jury found the prisonerguilty. A motion for a new trial was overruled, and sentence ofdeath passed, from which the prisoner appealed.Taylor. Ch. J. I have not been able to ascertain in what manner,slaves, accused of capital offences, were tried before the year1741. The collections of the laws which I have seen, are silenton that subject. But it may be conjectured that the county courtsentertained jurisdiction.Among the very few events, connected with the early settlementof the state, which history has condescended to notice, that of aninsurrection of the slaves, in 1738, has come down to us; and Iinfer from she period of its occurrence, that it suggested the rigorousand detailed system of police, which was established in two orthree years afterwards. Accustomed, as our ancestors were, tothe usages of the common law, and its solemnity in capital trials,they were probably impelled by a sense of common danger, andthe duty of self-preservation, to vest this extraordinary jurisdictionin three justices and four freeholders, who might be hastily collectedat the court house, and proceed to the condemnation andexecution of a slave, without indictment, jury, or notice to theowner. Had such a special jurisdiction, so wholly out of thecourse of the common law, been created without any specificationof the sort of testimony it should require, it is to be apprehendedthat very slight circumstances would have led to a conviction ; moreespecially in cases of conspiracy and insurrection, trials for whichhave in our own day produced monstrous injustice. It was a salutarycaution, to the triers, not to infer from the unusual mode oftrial, that they should be satisfied with weaker evidence than thecommon law prescribes ; and, since every other form by whichthe law aims to secure an impartial trial, was withdrawn from slaves,the legislature prescribes that rather more evidence shall be demandedfor their conviction, than is in general necessary. Reasoningof this kind occasioned, as I think, the act of 1741 todeclare, that the triers should " receive such testimony of negroes,mulattoes, or Indians, bond or free, with pregnant circumstances,as to them shall seem convincing " When the act of 1793 SLAVERY.tended the trial by jury to slaves, I strongly incline to believe thatit was a virtual repeal of so much of the above section as differsfrom the common law rule of evidence ; and that conferring theright of trial by jury in open court, does, ipso facto, draw after it,as an incident, the common law principles of evidence, and all theconsequences of common law proceedings. I do not, however,rest my opinion solely on this ground. It is to be observed, thatevery time the legislature have touched this subject since the revolution,it has been for the purpose of improving the condition ofslaves, more especially in admitting them to the benefit of an impartialtrial in capital cases.The act of 1806, giving the superior courts exclusive jurisdictionof capital crimes committed by slaves, extends to these personsthe full benefit of a common law trial, indictment, the benefit ofcounsel and clergy, and the right of challenge for cause ; withholdingonly the peremptory challenge, which could scarcely have beenof any use to them. The first section directs, " that thee trial shallbe conducted in the same manner, and under the same rules, regulations,and restrictions, as trials for freemen are now conducted."This, it seems to me, is full authority to the superior courts to lookat the common law for the rules of evidence, modified as they arein relation to colored persons, by the act of 1777 ; and I cannotdoubt, that the first section, taken together with the repealingclause, does annul the 48th section of the act of 1741. But whyshould the act of 1816, which does the legislature so much honor,be so construed as to place slaves on a better footing, in respect toevidence, than free persons ? On the trial of the latter for a capitalcrime, sworn to only by one witness, the jury is instructed tojudge of the credibility of the witness, and, if they believe him, thatone is sufficient to convict, without any pregnant circumstances.Whereas, if the rule of 1741 is still in force, the jury must be told,that however well satisfied they are with the testimony of one witness,or thoroughly convinced of the guilt of the slave, they mustnevertheless acquit him in the absence of pregnant circumstances;and this, notwithstanding the previous finding of the bill by a grandjury, and the examination of the case in a way the most favorableto the discovery of truth. If the grand jury cannot find thebill upon the testimony of one credible witness, without pregnantcircumstances, nor the petit jury convict, then the trial is not conducted"in the same manner, and under the same rules, regulations,and restrictions, as trials of freemen are now conducted." If criminalTRIAL AND PUNISHMENT OF SLAVES. 207slaves cannot be punished for crimes which are usually committedwith the most studied secrecy, but through a species of evidence notalways to be had, and which, if obtained, could not deepen the convictionarising from the testimony of a credible witness, it is to be apprehendedthat a mischievous state of impunity will be the consequence.There is one circumstance tending to show that the legislatureof 1802, did not believe the provision of 1741 was in force, forin the act " to prevent conspiracies and insurrections among theslaves," the rule of evidence is re-enacted in relation to these crimes.Now, the act of 1741, made it applicable not only to these offences,but to all others ; and if it were not repealed by the act of 1793,must have been in force in 1802. The act last noticed was passedsoon after some disturbances had arisen among the slaves in thelower part of the state, and the clause was probably re-enactedfor the purpose of tempering that excess which public excitementhad produced in the trials for these offences. Upon the whole, Ithink the conviction is right.Henderson, J. The act of 1741 erects a court for the trial ofslaves, composed of three or more justices of the peace, and fourfreeholders, and empowers and requires them to take for evidence,the confessions of the offender, the oath of one or more crediblewitnesses, or such testimony of negroes, mulattoes, or Indians, bondor free, with pregnant circumstances, as to them shall seemconvincing, without the solemnity of a jury. As long as thiscourt remained, under any modification, the testimony prescribedby the act remained with it. But when the trial of slaves wastransferred, first to the county court, by the act of 1793, and thento the superior court, by the act of 1816, courts proceeding byknown and established rules of evidence, the evidence prescribedto the court established by the act of 1741, was nottransferred with the jurisdiction, but the rules established in thecourt to which cognizance of the offence was transferred orgiven, became the rule of decision ; and it is not at all like thecase of treason or perjury to which it was attempted to liken it,for in them the rules of evidence are attached to the offence,and will follow its trial to any court ; but the rule prescribed tothe court, established by the act of 1741, is attached to the court ;and is confined to trials in that court, or to a court modified fromthat. I lay no stress on the words in the act of 1816, " rules, regulations,and restrictions ;" it is most probable they relate only tovhe form of the trial ; nor shall I search for reasons which might208 SLAVERY.have induced the legislature to require pregnant circumstances inone court, and not in the other ; or why, by the act of 1802, topunish slaves for conspiring to rebel or make insurrection, or tocommit murder, again prescribes the same rules as to the evidence ;and particularly that the testimony of one negro, or person ofcolor, shall not be deemed conclusive or sufficient to convict,without pregnant circumstances) thereby strongly implying, that it wasconsidered that the rule of evidence prescribed to the court, establishedby the act of 1741, was no longer in force ; but I know inpractice, the same thing is often for greater caution, re-enacted.I think this case is clear, upon the grounds, that the rule as topregnant circumstances was prescribed to another court than theone before which this slave was tried ; that the latter court, was inexistencebefore the transfer of cognizance ; that at the time of thetransfer it had rules of its own, including the rules of evidence,by which it is ascertained the disputed facts ; that by the act of1777, negroes, Indians, and mulattoes are declared to be competentwitnesses against each other, without calling in the aid of legislativeintention, arising from other acts. I can see no error inthe judge s charge, and no grounds for a new trial. Let the rulebe discharged.Hall, J. Dissentient. It is proper, in this case, to take a viewof all the acts of assembly which relate to it. The act passed in theyear 1741, ch. 24. sec. 48., is the first. It declares, that "if threeor more negroes or other slaves shall, at anytime hereafter, consult,advise, or conspire, to rebel or make insurrection, or shall plot orconspire the murther of any person whatsoever, such consulting,&c. shall be adjudged and deemed felony, and the slaves convictedthereof shall suffer death." It then declares, " that three justicesand four freeholders, owners of slaves, are empowered, upon oath,to try all manner of crimes and offences that shall be committedby any slave, at the court-house, and to take for evidence the confessionof the offender, the oath of one or more credible witnesses,or such testimony of negroes, mulattoes, or Indians, bond or free,with pregnant circumstances, as to them shall be convincing, withoutthe solemnity of a jury." Under this act, the uncorroborated testimonyof a slave would not be sufficient to convict a slave of anycrime. I do not think that the act of 1777, ch. 2. sec. 42., hasany bearing upon the present question. That act only incapacitatesnegroes, mulattoes, and some other persons, to be witnesses,TRIAL AND PUNISHMENT OF SLAVES. 209except against each other. This act only recognizes their competency,as the act of 41 had done, but it is silent as to the credibility.By the act of 1793, ch. 5., jurisdiction of all offences committedby slaves is transferred to the county courts, and to a juryof good and lawful men, owners of slaves. Nothing is said in thisact relative either to their competency or credibility, tf the act of1741 required pregnant circumstances to support the testimony ofa slave or negro, until it is repealed, it is still required. I cannot thinkthat transfer of jurisdiction from the three justices and four freeholders,owners of slaves, to the county courts, is, ipso facto, a repealof it. The act of 1802, ch. 17., makes some new regulations as tothe offences of conspiracy and insurrection, and declares, that as tothem, the testimony of a negro or person of color shall not bedeemed sufficient or conclusive to convict the person charged, unlessthe same shall be supported by such pregnant circumstancesas to the jury shall appear convincing. It may be asked, why didthe legislature interpose this guard against convictions for conspiracy,&c., when the same guard was interposed by the act of 1741against conviction of crimes of every description 1 The questionI cannot answer ; but I feel myself at liberty to say, that re-enacting in 1802, what was enacted in 1741, is no repeal of the first act.The next law on this subject was passed in the year 1816. NewRevisal, ch. 912. This act transfers to the superior court exclusivejurisdiction in all cases where slaves shall be charged with thecommission of any offence, the punishment whereof may extendto life, limb, or member, and under the same rules, regulations,and restrictions, as in trial of freemen for like offences. The latterexpression, 1 think, relates to the mode of conducting the trial.It is altogether silent, both as to the competency and credibility ofwitnesses : that as I apprehend, was left to the law as it then stood ;I mean the law of 1741. This case has been likened to the casesof high treason and perjury; and I think not improperly. In eachof those cases, two witnesses were necessary to a conviction ; andI think it would be required, until altered, upon a transfer of jurisdictionof those offences from one tribunal to another. The onlywant of resemblance between those cases and the one beforeus is, that in those cases, and those only, the testimony of one witnessis not sufficient to a conviction in the case of freedom ; and thetestimony of one witness, I mean that of a slave, without pregnantcircumstances, is not sufficient to convict slaves of any crime.It has been argued, that when the superior courts acquired juristsSLAVERY.diction in these cases, the rules of evidence attached to them, as intrials of free persons. I cannot come to the conclusion, that apositive law should be repealed by subsequent laws, in which solittle intimation is given of legislative will, that they should havethat effect. That the policy of the law of 1741 was founded on asense of the degraded state in which those unhappy beings existed,no doubt, will be ceded. Being slaves, they had no will of then-own,and a humane policy forbade that the life of a human being,(one of themselves) should be taken away upon testimony comingfrom them, unless some circumstances appeared in aid of that testimony.If this was a just policy, I am not aware, if we were nowto examine their condition, that any thing would be discovered somuch more favorable to the cause of truth, as to require a repealof the laws now in force, by the legislature, or a construction ofthem by the courts, tending to the same end. My opinion, therefore,is, that the rule for a new trial should be made absolute.2.STATE v. REED.

Taylor, Ch. J. I think there was no necessity to conclude theindictment against the form of the statute, for a law of paramountobligation to the statute was violated by the offence. Common law,founded upon the law of nature, and confirmed by revelation.The opinion I delivered on the State v. Boon remains unchanged,to which, and the effect of the act of 1827, as stated in the Statev. Hackett, (1 Hawk s Rep. 2 1C.) I beg leave to refer, as containingthe reasons wherefore, in this case, there ought to be judgment forthe state.Henderson, J. This record presents the question, is the killingof a slave, at this day, a statute or common law offence ? And ifa common law offence, what punishment is affixed to the actcharged in his record ? Homicide is the killing any read enablecreature. Murder is the killing any reasonable creature, withinthe protection of the law, with malice prepense, that is, with a designand without excuse. That a slave is a reasonable creature,TRIAL AND PUNISHMENT OF SLAVES. 211or more properly, a human being, is not, I suppose, denied. Butit is said, that being property, he is not within the protection of thelaw, and, therefore, the law requires not the manner of his death ;that the owner alone is interested, and the state no more concerned,independently of the acts of the legislature on that subject,than in the death of a horse. This is an argument, the force of whichI cannot feel, and leads to consequences abhorrent to my nature :yet if it be the law of the land, it must be so pronounced. I disclaimall rules or laws in investigating this question but the commonlaw of England, as brought to this country by our forefathers,when they emigrated hither, and as adopted by them, and as modifiedby various declarations of the legislature since, so as to justifythe foregoing definition. If, therefore, a slave is a reasonable creature,within the protection of the law, the killing a slave with maliceprepense, is murder by the common law. With the servicesand labors of the slave the law has nothing to do; they are themasters by the law ; the government and control of them belongexclusively to him. Nor will the law interfere upon the groundthat the state s rights, and not the master s, have been violated.In establishing slavery, then, the law vested in the master the absoluteand uncontrolled right to the services of the slave, and themeans of enforcing these services, follow as necessary consequences; nor will the law weigh with the most scrupulous nicety,his acts in relation thereto ; but the life of a slave being nowaysnecessary to be placed in the power of the owner for the full enjoymentof his services, the law takes care of that, and with me ithas no weight, to show that by the laws of ancient Rome or modernTurkey, an absolute power is given to the master over the lifeof his slave. I answer, these are not the laws of our country,nor the model from which they were taken ; it is abhorrent to thehearts of all those who have felt the influence of the mild preceptsof Christianity ; and if it is said, that no law is produced to showthat such is the state of slavery in our land, I call on them to showthe law by which the life of a slave is placed at the disposal of hismaster. In addition, I must say, that if it is not murder, it is nooffence, not even a bare trespass. Nor do I think that any thingshould be drawn from the various acts of the legislature on thesubject. Legislative exposition is good while the system of lawthus expounded is in force ; but when the whole system is abandoned,as is done by the act of 1817, exposition should be laidaside. But if the legislative exposition is to have weight, the last212 SLAVERY.should be received, and the act last mentioned to speak the languageof declaration, and not that of enactment. But it is not admittedthat the acts prior to the act of 1817, are by any means aclear legislative declaration, that it was no offence to kill a slaveanterior to any statutory provision. The first enactment that wehave on the subject, is a simple declaration, that if any personshall maliciously kill a slave, he shall suffer imprisonment. Fromthis we are not absolutely to conclude, that the legislature thoughtthat before that time it was no offence ; it is quite possible thatjuries had not applied the principles of the common law in theirpurity to the offence ; for we see the spirit of the times by the legislativeact ; but that spirit is happily no more. I would mention,as an additional argument, that if the contrary exposition of thelaw is correct, then the life of a slave is at the mercy of any one,even a vagabond ; and I would ask, what law is it that punishes, atthis day, the most wanton and cruel dismemberment of a slave,by severing a limb from his body, if life should be spared 1 Thereis no statute on the subject ; it is the common law cut down, it istrue, by statute or custom, so as to tolerate slavery, yielding to theowner the services of the slave, and any right incident thereto, asnecessary for its full enjoyment, but protecting the life and limbsof the human being ; and in these particulars, it does not admitthat he is without the protection of the law. I think, therefore,that judgment of death should be pronounced again the prisoner.Hall, J. Dissentient. I dissent from the opinion of the courtbelow in this case. Most of the reasons for this dissent are to befound in the case of the State v. Boon, Taylor s Rep. 252. Andit is unnecessary here to repeat them.3.THE STATE v. JIM, a negro slave. Dec.

After a verdict for the state, the defendant s counselmoved in arrest of judgment, on the ground that he was entitled toa jury of slave holders.Taylor, Ch. J. It appears to me, that the act of 1793, ch. 381.,extending the trial by jury to slaves, and directing the jury to becomposed of owners of slaves, is not repealed by any subsequentlaw. A twofold consideration dictated the policy of this law, theforce of which remains unimpaired by the extension of additionalprivileges to slaves. It was intended to surround the life of theslave with additional safeguards, and more effectually to protect theproperty of the owner, by infusing into the trial, that temperate andimpartial feeling, which would probably exist in persons owningthe same sort of property. That the master would have assuranceof an equitable trial by persons who had property constantly exposedto similar accusations, and would not wantonly sacrifice thelife of a slave, but yield it only to a sense of justice, daily experienceis sufficient to convince us. The property of a man is moresecure when he cannot be deprived of it, except by a jury, part ofwhom at least, have the like kind of property to lose. And thisreason, it seems to me, continues to operate with full force, notwithstandingthe many humane and valuable provisions which havebeen subsequently made for the trial of slaves.

See 3d article of the constitution of Missouri, and the constitutionof Alabama, tit. slaves, 2. And by the laws of Maryland, act of 1751, ch. 14., trialby jury is secured to slaves in capital cases. And so also in North Carolina, as appearsby Haywood s Manual, 532; and also in Tennessee. See Tennessee Laws of1813.214 SLAVERY.4.THE STATE v. CHARITY. Dec. T. 1830. 2 Devereaux s NorthCarolina Rep. 543.On an in The prisoner was indicted for the murder of her own child, anddictmenta- wag tr j e( j De f ore hj s Honor Judsre Strange. On the trial, thegainst aslave for a master was offered by the prosecution, to prove the confessionsfence, the of the prisoner. This was objected to by the master, and by theP r i sooner but the objection was overruled, and the witness enamelledto dined. The prisoner was convicted, and appealed to this court.Ruffin, J. I do not know that the question made in this casehas ever arisen before in this state. Nor have I been able to finda decision of it in any of our sister states. It must be decided,therefore, on general principles. It is a fundamental rule of evidenceat common law, that a party to a suit, or one directly interestedin the result, is not competent to testify on the side of hisinterest, nor can he be compelled to testify against it. This ruleless frequently applies to public prosecutions than to civil actions ;because it cannot often happen that private rights are directly involved,or can be consequentially affected by verdicts or indictments.But when they are, the rule prevails in one case as well as theother, subject to a few certain exceptions of necessity or statuteprovision : as in cases of violence on the wife, or of a witness whois entitled to a reward, on a conviction of the offender, upon histestimony. But in other instances, there is no distinction betweenthe effect of a direct interest in criminal or civil cases. A wifecannot testify for one who is a co-defendant with her husbandupon an indictment for a riot or conspiracy. A prosecutor, orhis wife, cannot give evidence in an indictment for forcible entry,under the statutes of Henry and James. One charged as accessary,cannot be a witness for the principal, and other like cases Thishas never been carried so far as to embrace heirs apparent, or entail,or remainders, or masters of apprentices. In the formercases, the interest is too uncertain and remote ; in the latter, thereis no legal interest, because there is no properly. But in the caseof master and slave, the interest is direct and immediate. Thewhole property in the slave is in jeopardy, and the master is liablefor the costs in case of a conviction. He is not, it is true, partyto the record, in the sense of reversing the judgment for any irregularityin giving him notice ; which is a collateral matter withinthe discretion of the court, as to the time and mode of proceeding.But his interests are essentially at stake, as much as the life of theTRIAL AND PUNISHMENT OF SLAVES. 215slave is. The rule of exclusion or protection, on the score of interest,must apply in all cases alike, because it is drawn from theknown general frailty of our species. The evidence of an interestedwitness is rejected, because we cannot have confidence, thatmen in general in that state will tell the truth, and the whole truth.The temptation is too strong for men to be exposed to it ; and thedanger of a jury being misled is too great. This applies equally toall cases. I think, therefore, that a master cannot be a witnessfor his slave. It follows, that he ought not to be forced on theother side. But this suggests another difficulty. The privilegenot to testify, upon the ground of interest, is that of the master,and not of the slave. It may be consequently waved by the former.He may himself prosecute, and give evidence against hisslave. And since that is certain, I have entertained the most seriousscruples against interfering with this conviction. It cannot bepresumed that the master would falsely and corruptly destroy hisown property. His evidence on the side of his interest may besuspected ; but that against it, cannot be supposed to be strongerthan the truth would justify. If so, the prisoner can have nocause to complain. And could I separate her rights from thoseof the witness, I would do so, and let the verdict stand. But theyare so connected, that justice cannot be done to the master, withoutgiving the slave the benefit of it. We cannot restore him hisproperty, without yielding her another trial for her life ; nor reversethe judgment for the costs, without reversing it altogether.I therefore conclude, with much hesitation, that as the master didobject to be sworn, there must be a new trial. When I speak ofthe power of the master to wave his privilege and give testimony,I would not be understood as putting the slave s life in the master shands, and resting it on his mercy. I allude to testimony tofacts within his knowledge. When he is called to confessions, adifferent state of the case may arise, in which the privilege will bethat of the prisoner. The confessions may have been made inreference to defence, and as instructions for conducting it ; orbeing to the master, may or may not be of that voluntary characterwhich the law, not less in wisdom than humanity, requires. Uponthose points, not the slightest intimation of opinion is now intended;for there is not a little difficulty in them, and this case does not requirea decision upon them.The exception of the prisoner does not present an objection tothe evidence, upon either of these grounds ; and therefore the216 SLAVERY.court must take it, that none existed in point of fact ; that the confessionswere made freely, and not with a view to defence.Hall, J. The question submitted to the court is one of a complexnature. The rights of the state, of the master, and of theslave, are involved in it. If the offence charged in the indictmenthas been commited, the state is entitled to redress, by the legalconviction and punishment of the slave. In such case, the mastermust submit to the loss of the slave, and the slave must submit toher fate. But it is necessary to inquire, whether the rights of eitherhave been violated. First, with respect to the rights of the master.It is a rule of evidence, that a party to a suit cannot be admitted orcompelled to give evidence in it, because he is directly interestedin the issue of it. The trial throws directly upon a loss or a benefit.He is, therefore, on the score of interest, altogether excluded fromgiving evidence. It may be taken in the present case, that themaster is not a party in form to the proceeding. But he is substantiallyso. He has as great an interest in the issue, as if it wasmade up in an action of detinue, to which he was a party. Theconviction of the slave, is a judgment against him to the amount ofher value. In addition to this, he is made liable by the act of 1793(Rev. Code 381.) for the costs of the prosecution, provided theslave, if a free person, would be liable for them. And there is nodoubt, that she would be liable upon conviction.I therefore think, that the master was so much interested in thecase, that he ought not to have been examined as a witness, whenobjected to by himself. The objection, however, is personal tothe master. It cannot be taken by the slave. As to her, the evidencewas legal. But to rectify the error as to the master a newtrial must be awarded. As to the rights of the slave, were themaster to forego his interest, and voluntarily give evidence againsther, I am inclined to think, that she might legally object to hisgiving in evidence any of her confessions made to him, because,by the act of 1793, (Rev. C. 381.) he is authorized to defend her;and because she is his slave, and by various means, against whichslavery could make but little resistance, he might extract from herany confessions he pleased.But upon this part of the case I give no opinion.Henderson, Ch. J. My concurrence in the opinion of the court,in excluding the master on the ground of interest, is so feeble, thatit almost amounts to a dissent. Where pecuniary interest only isat stake, to exclude a witness on the score of interest, howeverTRIAL AND PUNISHMENT OF SLAVES. 217small, is applying a scale of morality to our nature sufficiently humiliating.But where the life or death of a fellow being is to betheresult of the trial, to exclude a witness, because he may have apecuniary interest, either in preserving or in taking the life of theaccused, is attributing to us, frail as we know ourselves to be, moredepravity than we are willing, I think, to admit. And the rule, aslaid down by the court, as I understand it, excludes the master onthe same ground, that of interest, from becoming a witness for hisslave ; for the rule must be mutual. If he cannot be compelledto give evidence against his slave, because he has an interest in hisacquittal, he cannot, if he wishes, or rather is willing, to give evidencefor the slave, on the same ground.I should rather suppose, that the interest at stake, being so entirelydifferent from that which is brought forward to protect thewitness from giving evidence, or to exclude him, if willing, is not tobe weighed in the same balance with mere pecuniary interest. Itis so transcendant in its nature, that its weight is not to be ascertainedby mere money balances. Cases are to be found in whichwitnesses were objected to, on the score of interest in procuringconvictions for the sake of reward. They were admitted because itwas said, that the statute giving the reward contemplated them asgood witnesses ; for the reward is given on condition that theygave, or procured to be given, material evidence on the trial. Thereare other cases of interest arising under a statute giving them advantages,in which the statute renders them competent But Iknow of no case of life and death, where interest excluded a witness.These statute cases did not require a further investigation of theprinciple of the rule of exclusion. They were admitted, not excluded.These different kinds of interest were not thrown intothe opposite scales of the same balance. I consider indictmentsunder the statute of forcible entries and detainers, as mere civilsuits, and the decisions under them as made in civil causes. Forthe prosecutor, if successful, obtains a writ of restitution. I aminclined to think, but I am by no means satisfied, that the masteris a good witness for his slave ; and if so, may be compelled togive evidence against him ; that is, as to acts, but not as to confessions; and more particularly, as to those made in reference to defence.But I think that they ought to be excluded in all cases ofconfessions. The master has an almost absolute control over thebody and mind of his slave. The master s will is the slave s will.All his acts, all his sayings, are made with a view to propitiate his218 SLAVERY.master. His confessions are made, not from a love of truth, notfrom a sense of duty, not to speak a falsehood, but to please hismaster ; and it is vain that his master tells him to speak the truth,and conceals from him how he wished the question answered.The slave will ascertain, or which is the same thing, think that hehas ascertained the wishes of his master, and mould his answeraccordingly. We, therefore, more often get the wishes of themaster, or the slave s belief of his wishes, than the truth. And thisis so often the case, that the public justice of the country requiresthat they should be altogether excluded. Confessions made topropitiate the good opinion of the gaoler, or to avert harsh treatment,are excluded upon the same principle. I think the case ofthe master and slave much stronger. The power of the gaoler istemporary and limited ; that of the master permanent and almostunlimited. The public, justice of the country loses but little byexcluding these confessions ; for confessions of all kinds are veryquestionable guides to truth. In crimes of any magnitude, theyseldom speak the truth. But if I should be entirely mistaken asregards the slave s confessions in general, I think that confessionsmade in reference to defence certainly cannot be received ; forthe master, from his situation, from the duties which the legislaturehave imposed on him, is the guardian and defender of his slave. Itis a moral duty of the highest grade, to see that no injustice isdone him. The relation subsisting between them, imposes uponhim a load of obligations, and he should not be permitted, even ifwilling, to disregard them. He is the medium of communicationwith the counsel in court ; and a fair and free defence cannot bemade, if this confidence is permitted to be violated. In the presentcase, it does not appear what was the object in making theconfession. In common cases, the party must bring his casewithin the law, as if his question regarded the evidence of one whowas an attorney, it must be stated that the disclosure related to acase in which he acted as counsel of him who made the confession,and that it related to the cause. In this case I think it is different.Prima facie, the confession was made with reference to defenceor protection ; for the master is the perpetual defender and protectorof his slave. And if it did not relate to defence or protectionit should be shown on the other side. At least, in a case ofsuch magnitude to the prisoner, I should be unwilling to considerit as made with a different intent, unless proved to be so. Judgmentof the court below reversed, and a new trial granted.TRIAL AND PUNISHMENT OF SLAVES. 2195.THE STATE v.

It does not appear to me from any construction de^eol" 6which I can make of the laws of this state, respecting the punish punishmentof slaves, that they are made liable to be punished with death,in any case where the like punishment is not by law to be inflictedon a freeman ; except only in the cases mentioned in the 47th sectionof the act concerning servants and slaves, passed in the year1741. I cannot prevail on myself to adjudge, in any case, thata Crime shall be punished with death, unless there is an expresslaw for that purpose ; and am of opinion, that no implication,however obvious, can be admitted in such case, and that the discretionallowed in these cases, must apply to the quantum or measure,not the degree of punishment. Therefore, it is my opinion,that the judgment be reversed, and that the prisoner be remandedto receive such other punishment, short of death, as the court whotried her shall think just, so that the same be warranted by thelaws and constitution of the state.Taylor, J. In ascertaining the true construction of the act, it isnecessary to take into view some others which have been maderelative to the same subject. The whole are founded on a principleof severe policy, absolutely necessary to guard society againstthe evil consequences resulting from the condition of slavery.Where some offences had been previously provided against, in anact passed the same session, one perhaps at that time of frequentoccurrence, in the nature of a conspiracy by three or more, to220 SLAVERY.rebel or murder, is by this act made punishable with death. Thenext clause requires, that upon a slave being convicted of anyother crime or misdemeanor, such judgment shall be passed, accordingto the discretion of the court, as the nature of the crime shallrequire. These expressions do, in my opinion, give the court apower to inflict any punishment upon any crime or misdemeanor,where a specific punishment had not been previously directed bylaw.In such cases the prescribed punishment must be inflicted ;but in all others the court are to regulate their discretion by thenature of the crime. This will depend upon their frequency,enormity, the temptation to commit them, the necessity of an example,and a variety of other circumstances, that ought, in a peculiarmanner, to be considered in estimating the offences of thesepersons. It certainly could not be the intent of the legislaturethat they should be punished according to the ordinary penal code,for then it were unnecessary to have gone further than a simpleregulation of the trial, and not to have said any thing about thepunishment ; and because, by the former act, the offence of stealingcertain property is punishable with whipping and the pillory ;whereas stealing money would only be punished by burning in thehand. This is a discrimination in favor of an offence of equalmagnitude, which I do not think the legislature intended to make.The act of 1786 (Iredell s Revisal, page 588.) does, in the preamblerecognize the fact, that many persons by cruel treatment totheir slaves, cause them to commit crimes for which they are executed.It then proceeds to take away the allowance which hadbeen theretofore made to the owners of such slaves. The crueltreatment here alluded to must consist in withholding from themthe necessaries of life ; and the crimes thus resulting, are such asare calculated to furnish them with food and raiment. It then appears,that in 1786, the legislature was perfectly aware, that from1741 until that time, it had been the practice to execute slavesupon a conviction of grand larceny, when free persons were onlyburnt in the hand ; and they have not declared that this is a falseexposition of the law. It seems to me that the acts subsequentlymade, had no other end than to extend to them the trial by jury,and to ascertain the respective provinces of the court and the jury,still leaving the discretion of the former, as to the punishment, asunlimited as the first act had made it. I am sensible that thelaw is a harsh one ; and I fear that abuses have been committedunder it ; but these may be controlled by the legislature wheneverTRIAL AND PUNISHMENT OF SLAVES. 221they think fit to interpose. Thinking as I do, from the short timeI have had to deliberate on this case, that their intention is freefrom doubt, a sense of duty compels me to pronounce it, howeverrepugnant it may be to my private notions of humanity.Malay, J. The act of assembly passed in 1741, sec. 47., ofchap, xxiv., makes the consulting, the advising, the conspiring torebel, to make insurrection the plotting or conspiring of three ormore slaves to murder any person or persons whatever, to be felony,and on conviction to suffer death. Section 48. of same chapter,directs the manner in which every slave committing such offence,or any other crime or misdemeanor, shall be tried, and what evidenceshall be admissible, and direct the three justices and thefour freeholders, on the slave or slaves being found guilty, " topass such judgment on such offender according to their discretion,as the nature of the crime or offence shall require, and on suchjudgment to award execution." The offence found by the jury inthis case, is an attempt to poison ; therefore the offence does notcome under the description of any of those offences enacted bythe 47th section. Had the act stopped here, she must have beenacquitted. But section 48 empowers the three justices and fourfreeholders to try her for any other crime or misdemeanor, and topass such judgment, according to their discretion, as the nature ofthe offence may require.Crimes and misdemeanors were offences known by the law atthe time of passing this act, and the punishment also known andestablished. The offence found against Sue is an attempt to poison.If the same offence was committed by a free person, it couldnot be punished with death ; it is only a misdemeanor of an aggravatednature, and could be punished with fine, imprisonment,and other corporal punishment ; no judgment of death could begiven. The punishment of this particular offence was knownwhen the act passed. The act has made no alteration in the punishment; it was then discretionary with the court. It never wasconsidered that the court could give judgment of death for this offence; they could fine, imprison, or inflict other corporal punishment,as had been established by common usage. The discretiongiven by the act of assembly, is a legal discretion, not the powerof altering punishments, or affixing to any offence a punishmentunknown to the law. This would be for the court to legislate, notto adjudicate, a power unknown to any of the courts of this state.222 SLAVERY.The justices of the county court have pronounced a judgmentdifferent from the nature of the offence which the jury have foundagainst the prisoner ; their discretion only extends to increasingor diminishing the punishment. Let the judgment pronouncedby the said justices against the prisoner be reversed, and the prisonerbe remanded to said justices, to receive such judgment as thelaws and constitution of this state will warrant.6.BORE v.

Free personsof color are certainly bound to treat the citizens of the statewith respect ; and if they do not, they are subject to fine and imprisonment.But the law has provided, that for offences of thiskind, they are entitled to a trial by jury. Now, as justices of thepeace have no right to summon juries, it is a necessary consequenceof the want of authority to do so, that the defendant was withoutpower to try and condemn. The only cognizance he could takeof the case was, to commit the plaintiff, unless he gave bail for hisappearance at the next term of the district court. Mat.

The slave has no agency in making them. He is indeed onecause of the apprehended evils to the other class, which those laws are expected toremedy. That he should be held amenable for a violation of those rules establishedfor the security of the other, is the natural result of the state in which he is placed.And the severity of those rules will always bear a relation to that danger, real or ideal,of the other class.It has been so among all nations, and will ever continue to be so, while the disparitybetween bond and free remains.

Whether the law of principal and agendas adoptedby the common law, can be applied to master and slave, may be doubted ; at least to itsfull extent. But there can be no doubt but that in the ordinary domestic business ofthe master in which it is usual to employ slaves, the master may do his business throughthe agency of his slave, and is bound by the acts of the slave in the usual course ofthat business with others. Perhaps the true distinction is, that in the ordinary businessof the master, the slave may be an agent, and the law will imply a contract on the partof the master, but where sk dl and improved intellect are requisite for the performanceof the undertaking or business, there would arise no implication ; but an express commandor ratification would be necessary to hold the master liable.226 SLAVERY.fendant had instructed the pregnant slave to obtain the services of acolored midwife, whose services could be obtained for $4 00.; but theslave obtained the services of the plaintiff s wife, who charged $10,which was the usual charge.

The general rule is, that the master isnot liable for the contract of his slave, made without his consentor authority. But there are many exceptions to the general rule,and this case appears to be one of them. If a slave is in peril inthe absence of his master, the interest of the owner is most effectuallysubserved by rendering assistance to the slave ; and in goodconscience, the owner is bound to make satisfaction. In additionto this, the case in hand is peculiar. The situation of the defendants slave was that which is generally one of extreme peril,requiring instant aid. And if that was the situation of the defendants slave at the time Mrs. Johnson, the plaintiff, was called in ;and I understand it was from the justices certificate, she was withinthe exception, and was entitled to recover. I am, therefore, of opinion,that the order of the circuit court concerning the justices shouldbe reversed, and that of the county court affirmed.3.WELLS v. Tenderly. Jan.

Judgment Owes rendered228 SLAVERY.in favor] of Buzzard s administrators, and Gore appealed to thiscourt.Per Cur. Carr, J. The facts proved furnish the strongestgrounds to infer, that for a series of years, Gore was in the habit ofgetting his leather from Buzzard s tannery; that though his slaveswere his agents, or rather his instruments for carrying raw hidesto the tanner, and bringing back tanned leather, yet it was he whosent the raw material and received the manufactured article ; andthat he was to pay the difference, if any, between values of whathe thus bought and sold.When Buzzard s administrators rendered the account, at Gore sinstance, he examined it, and did not object to any of the chargesagainst him ; he only objected to the charge of interest, and saidthat if they would give him the credits he was entitled to, he wouldpay the principal. This was a plain admission of the justice of theaccount, except as to the interest, and as to the credits he claimed,which, however, he never attempted to prove ; and this admissionalone affords a decisive answer to the whole argument for the appellant.Judgment affirmed.5.Captain v.

Patton suffered and caused to enlist as a musician, in the ryservice of the United States, his negro named Frederick, who renderedserved during the war by consent of his master, and was thus entitledto a one thousand acre warrant for his services. That onthe 8th August, 1821, a warrant, No. 766, for one thousand acres,issued to the University of North Carolina, for the services of saidslave, reciting that he died without heirs, which was assigned bythe University to Andrews, and by Andrews to John Terrill. Itwas entered and surveyed in Dec. 1822, in the name of John Terrill, and an amended bill was filed stating that fact. A copy of thewarrant filed with the bill, shows the interest in the warrant wasvested in John Terrill. The land was not granted in September,1823, when the bill was filed. The bill was dismissed by the complainantagainst Andrews, as he had transferred his interest, and nodecree could be had against him. The University appeared bytheir counsel, and a subpoena and a copy of the bill were servedon Terrill in Weakly county, and against both parties the bill wasset for hearing ex parte.At September term, 1829, it was ordered, by consent of the parties,that this cause await the final decision of the supreme courtof errors and appeals in the cause of Iveyy v. Pinson ; and in March1832, th at su having been decided, the chancellor pronounced adecree in favor of complainant. One of the errors assigned was,that the warrant issued to the slave, the property of the complainants father, was unauthorized and void; and vested no right inthe complainant.Per Cur. Catron, Ch. J. It is contended, that the act of 1782, ch.3* sec. 6., never could have intended to provide a permanent rewardin land, a home and fireside for a slave incapable of holding property,without a will of his own, and who, from his political andmoral condition, it was impossible to reward. This argument hasgreat force in it ; but it is addressed to us in vain. The board ofcommissioners of North Carolina has construed the act of 1782,and adjudged that negro Frederick, for his services ag a musician230 SLAVERY.in the continental line, was entitled to one thousand acres of land.By the act of 1804, ch. 14., North Carolina reserved the exclusiveright of issuing military warrants, although Tennessee was entrustedwith power to cause them to be located. As between thesoldier and North Carolina, acting as a sovereign power throughher commissioners, the adjudication that Frederick was entitled isconclusive. Pinson and Hawkins v.

In that case, the defendant s negroeshad suffered a fire to break out from the field where they were atwork, and to burn up the plaintiff s crib of corn. The court held,that the defendant was not liable for the negligence of his servants.And the question was decided upon general principles, and notupon the particular circumstances of the case. Whether the resultof the negligence be the burning of the crib of corn, or thebreaking of a cart, the principle would be the same. The rule,however, does not extend to slaves who are tradesmen, carriers,&c., for there the master s security for their faithful performanceof their duty depends upon his holding them out as capable of performingthe work or business undertaken.(C.)

The covenant of the plaintiff to manumit the negroin eight years, on condition of faithful service, was one that theslave could avail himself of if the condition was fulfilled. Whatwas said by the court in the case of negro Tom, 5 Johns. Rep. 365.,is to that effect. The manumission of a slave does not rest uponthe principles of a contract, depending upon a consideration ; butit is an act of benevolence, sanctioned by the statute, and madeobligatory, if in writing.LIABILITIES OF MASTER FOR ACTS OF SLAVE. 2334.STEVENSON v.

The ownerof the slave has the most complete and perfect property in him.The slave may be sold, or devised, or pass by descent, in the samemanner as other inheritable estate. He has no civil rights or privileges.He is incapable of making or discharging a contract, andthe perpetual right to his services belongs exclusively to his owner.The slave was illegally discharged, and the master is entitledto recover his full wages up to the time when he might have returnedto the United States.SLAVERY.An ownerwho hasnotice of acapitalcharge againsthisslave, incaseof aconvictionis not onlybound topay theprison fees,bulls thefee allowedby the actof 1797,(Rev. ch.484.) forcarryingthe sentenceintoexecution.The ownermay beprosecutedcivilly fordamagesfor theft,&c. of hisslave beforea criminalprosecutionisinstituted.6.THE STATE v. JONES. Dec. T. 1828. 2 Devereaux s NorthCarolina Rep. 48.Negro Charles, the property of the defendant, had been convictedof a rape, and executed.A question was made before his honor Judge Norwood, whetherthe defendant, as the owner of the slave, was liable to his prisoncharges, and to the fee often dollars allowed for carrying the sentenceof death into execution. Both questions were decided forthe state, and the defendant appealed.Per Cur. Hall, J. From the two acts of assembly recited inthe case of the State v. Isaac, decided at this term, 2 Dev. Rep.47., the defendant, Jones, the owner of the slave, is liable for thecosts of prosecution against him, because if the slave had been afreeman, his estate would be liable. With respect to the fee of5 for executing Charles, it is included, I think, in the costs ofprosecution. In the act of 1797, (Rev. ch. 484,) amongst otherfees to which the sheriff is entitled, for apprehending and carryingcriminals to jail, ten shillings is allowed for carrying any sentenceor decree of the court into execution, where the convict is to becorporally punished, and 5 for the execution and decent burial ofany one. By the same act, provision is made for the payment ofsuch fees by the state, provided they cannot be got out of the estate,or body of the prisoner.But it declares, that no such claim shall be allowed, until a fierifacias shall have issued to the county in which the prisoner maybesupposed to have owned property, and the sheriff s return thereon,that nothing was to be found, nor until a capias ad satisfacen-dum, shall have issued, and if it was executed upon the body ofthe criminal, not until he discharged himself by taking the oath ofinsolvency. From this act it appears that the estate of the slavewould be liable m case he was a freeman. It follows, of course,that his owner is so. Judgment affirmed.7.MOFFIT v. Lion.

Upon the plea of not guilty, the plaintiff proved the deathof the horse, occasioned by the sticks which had been tied to histail, and the confession of Caldwell, that his negro boy had tiedsticks to the horse s tail, the horse having frequently broken intohis wheat field. Upon being then informed by the witness that hehad understood the horse had died from the abuse occasioned bythe sticks which had been tied to his tail, Caldwell replied thathe was glad of it. Verdict for the plaintiff, and motion for a newtrial. There is no point of difficulty in the cause. For whetherthe conduct of the slave was under the direction or sanction of themaster, is not material ; or whether the master s direction orsanction thereof is tested by his express command, or by his presence,and not forbidding the act ; or by other circumstances evincinghis approbation, is equally immaterial. He is in either caseliable. For the law is, if one agree to a trespass which has beencommitted by another for his benefit, this action lies against him,although it was not done in obedience to his command, or at hisrequest.

SINGLETON, 1 Leigh s Rep. 72.Per Cur. Coalter, J. The pauper, in this case, claims his A court offreedom on an alleged contract between his master and him, H the no"enforcetime he was purchased at an executor s sale, that on paying his a contractr J betweenpurchase money, he should be free. Ke alleges, that he has paid master andaccordingly ; but that his master would not emancipate him. The wherebyproof of the contract is by no means clear ; although, if that wasproved, and such a contract could be enforced in equity, there is he winemancipateproof enough in the record, of his master having received some his slaveafter a cereto wit, a wagon and three horses, which the pauper tain contias his own, and the proceeds of his earning by warning, ^^3to send the case to an account. There is no case in this court, which 9-i T ~ . dition hasthat 1 can find, justifying the idea that a court of equity can en been corn-forcesuch a contract; but, the reverse has been decided, as will by^thebe seen hereafter. There is no doubt that a court of equity may slaveentertain a bill, where the party has been detained in slavery, andhas a legal title to his freedom ; but there is some impediment tothe assertion of that right at law, which would, in any other case,justify the interposition of a court of equity. As, if the will, bywhich he was emancipated, was fraudulently suppressed or destroyed; or a deed, prior to that of emancipation, and which hadbeen abandoned, was fraudulently set up as a bar to the recoveryat law ; as was lately decided in the case of Albert v. Jenny, 6Rand s Rep. 59. In the case of Dempsey v. Lawrence, Gilt sRep. 333., the pauper was not so before the court, as that the meritscould be decided, either by the court below, or by this court.The bill was dismissed ; and this court only sent the case back, tobe placed in a situation in which it could be tried on the merits.How this court would have decided, could the merits have beengone into, cannot, therefore, be known ; and, consequently, thatcase can give no rule in this. The case of John Rose, a pauper,v. Maxwell, adm r of Duncan Rose, juu., was decided in thiscourt against the pauper. That was a very strong case for thepauper, as I find by my note of it, though I was not present whenit was decided. According to these notes, it appears, that thisman belonged to the estate of the late Col. Banister, near Petersburg; that he was the son of Duncan Rose, the elder, who, on238 SLAVERY.bis death bed, recommended him to the care of his nephew, the intestateof the appellee. On the sale of Banister s estate, he waspurchased by Dr. Wilson for 90Z., who sold him to the intestatefor the same sum. The intestate then put him apprentice to a carpenter.After his apprenticeship, he worked as a journeyman,and down to the death of the intestate, worked for himself, andwas treated as a freeman by his employer, who paid him his earnings.The intestate frequently admitted that he was free, and saidthat he had paid him his purchase money, and more ; and neverinterfered with him as a slave. His administrator always consideredhim as free ; but finding that he had not been emancipatedby deed, and not knowing but that he would be taken to paydebts, considered it his duty to take him as a slave. He says heis not hostile to his claim to freedom ; but suggests, for the considerationof the court, whether a contract for freedom can be set upin a court of equity, and whether any other mode of emancipationthan that prescribed by law, can be sustained. By the act of May,1723, 4 stat., at Large, 132., it is enacted, that no negro, mulatto,or Indian slave, shall be set free on any pretence whatever, exceptfor some meritorious service, to be adjudged and allowed by thegovernor and council, and license therefor first had and obtained ;that if they shall be otherwise set free, it shall be lawful for thechurchwardens, and they are required, to take them up and sellthem as slaves, &c. This is re-enacted by the act of October,1748, 6 stat., at Large, 112. By the act of May, 1782, 11 stat.,at Large., 39, reciting, that application had been made to empowerpersons disposed to emancipate their slaves to do so, it is enactedthat it shall hereafter be lawful for any person, by his last will andtestament, or by any other instrument in writing, under his or herhand and seal, attested and proved in the county court by two witnesses,&c., to emancipate his slaves, or any of them, &c. Thisact is brought into the revision of 1794, ch. 103., sec. 36., bythe 26th section of which, 1 Rev. Code, 433, it is made unlawfulto permit slaves to go at large, and hire themselves out, underpenalty of being apprehended and sold ; and is also brought intothat of 3819. sec. 53., p. 433.It has also been decided by this court, that a deed of emancipation,not recorded in the proper court, but in some other, gives notitle to freedom, until properly recorded.

BY ASSAULTING, BEATING, OR HARBORING HIM.1.Confute v. DALE. April T. 1800. 1 Har. & John s. Rep. 4.This was an action of trespass for an assault and battery com Trespassmitted by the defendant on the plaintiff s slave. TIt was contended, that the action could be sustained, and that it foranas-- . sault andwas not necessary to prove a loss of service ; that an action might battery onbe supported for beating the plaintiff s horse, 2 Lute. 1481 ; 20 SlS^t beViner s Abr. 454 : and that the lord might have an action for the attendedwith a lossbattery of his villein which is founded on this principle, that as the of service.villein could not support the action, the injury would be withoutredress unless the lord could. On the other side, it was said, thatLd. Ch. J. Raymond had decided, that an assault on a horse wasno cause of action, unless accompanied with a special damage.Ch. J. Chase assigned, among other reasons, for the decision infavor of the defendant, that the action did not lie, because therewas not a reciprocity of action ; no action being maintainableagainst a master for an assault and battery committed by his slave ;and that the injury to the slave was not dis punishable, it being indictableas an offence ; and that without an injury or wrong tothe master, no action could be sustained. And see Before v.Caldwell, 2 Bibb s Rep. 76, where the court say, that actual possessionof the slave by the master is necessary to entitle him to anaction of trespass for beating him.2.SMITH v.

HALE. Dec. T. 1823. 2 Hawk s North CarolinaRep. 582. A batterycommittedwas an indictment charging the defendant with having on a slave,240 SLAVERY.nojustifica- committed an assault on a slave, and with inhumanly beatingwounding, &c. The jury found, that the defendant committedP persona ^ violence on the slave, mentioned in the indictment, byshown, is. striking him ; and whether this amounted to the offence charged,an indictableoffence, they referred it to the court to decide. The judge below renderedjudgment for the defendant, and the state appealed.Taylor, Ch. J. The indictment, in this case, is for an inhumanassault and battery, but the special verdict states, that the defendantstruck the slave. The question, therefore, presented to thecourt, is, whether a battery, committed on a slave, no justification,or circumstances attending it being shown, is an indictable offence.As there is no positive law, decisive of the question, asolution of it must be deduced from general principles, from reasoningsfounded on the common law, and adapted to the existingcondition and circumstances of our society, and indicating that resultwhich is best adapted to general expedience. Presumptiveevidence of what this is, arises, in some degree, from usage, ofwhich the legislature must have been long since apprised, by therepeated conviction and punishment of persons charged with thisoffence. It would be a subject of regret to every thinking person,if courts of justice were restrained, by any austere rule of judicature,from keeping pace with the march of benignant policy andprovident humanity, which for many years has characterised everylegislative act relative to the protection of slaves, and which Christianity,by the mild diffusion of its light and influence, has contributedto promote ; and even domestic safety and interest equallyenjoin.The wisdom of this course of legislation has not exhausted itselfon the specific objects to which it was directed, but has producedwider and happier consequences, in securing to this class of persons,milder treatment and more attention to their safety. For the verycircumstance of their being brought within the pale of legal protectionhas had a corresponding influence upon the tone of publicfeeling towards them ; has rendered them of more value to theirmasters, and suppressed many outrages, which were before but toofrequent. It is, however, objected in this case, that no offence hasbeen committed, and the indictment is not sustainable, because theperson assaulted is a slave, who is not protected by the generalcriminal law of the state ; but that, as the property of an individual,the owner may be redressed by a civil action. But though neitherthe common law, nor any other code yet devised by man, couldLIABILITY OF OTHERS TO THE MASTER FOR, &c. 241foresee and specify every case that might arise, and thus supercedethe use of reason in the ordinary affairs of life, yet it furnishes theprinciples of justice adapted to every state and condition of society.It contains general rules, fitted to meet the diversified relations,and various conditions of social man. Many of the most importantof these rules are not set down in any statute or ordinance, but dependupon common law for their support ; of this description is therule, that breaking the public peace is an offence, and punishableby fine and imprisonment. An assault and battery is not indictablein any case to redress the private injury ; for that is to be effectedby a civil action ; but, because the offence is injurious to the citizensat large by its breach of the peace, by the terror and alarm it excites,by the disturbance of that social order which is the primaryobject of the law to maintain, and by the contagious example ofcrimes.The instinct of a slave may be, and generally is, tamed into subservienceto his master s will, and from him he receives chastisement,whether it be merited or not, with perfect submission ; forhe knows the extent of the dominion assumed over him, and thatthe law ratifies the claim. But when the same authority is wantonlyusurped by a stranger, nature is disposed to assert her rights,and to prompt the slave to a resistance, often momentarily successful,sometimes fatally so. The public peace is thus broken, asmuch as if a free man had been beaten, for the party of the aggressoris always the strongest, and such contests usually terminate byoverpowering the slave, and inflicting on him a severe chastisement,without regard to the original cause of the conflict. There is,consequently, as much reason for making such offences indictable,as if a white man had been the victim. A wanton injury committedon a slave is a great provocation to the owner, awakens hisresentment, and has a direct tendency to a breach of the peace,by inciting him to seek immediate vengeance. If resented in theheat of blood, it would probably extenuate a homicide to manslaughter,upon the same principle with the case stated by LordHale, that if A. riding on the road, B. had whipped his horse out ofthe track, and then A. had alighted and killed B. These offences areusually committed by men of dissolute habits, hanging loose uponsociety, who, being repelled from association with well disposedcitizens, take refuge in the company of colored persons and slaves,whom they deprave by their example, embolden by their familiarity,and then beat, under the expectation that a slave dare not242 SLAVERY.resent a blow from a white man. If such offences may be committedwith impunity, the public peace will not only be renderedextremely insecure, but the value of slave property must bemuch impaired, for the offenders can seldom make any reparationin damages. Nor is it necessary, in any case, that a person whohas received an injury, real or imaginary-from a slave, shouldcarve out his own justice ; for the law has made ample and summaryprovision for the punishment of all trivial offences committedby slaves, by carrying them before a justice, who is authorized topass sentence for their being publicly whipped. 1 Rev. Code, 448.This provision, while it excludes the necessity of private vengeance,would seem to forbid its legality, since it effectually protects allpersons from the insolence of slaves, even where their masters areunwilling to correct them upon complaint being made. The commonlaw has often been called into efficient operation, for the punishmentof public cruelty inflicted upon animals, for needless andwanton barbarity exercised even by masters upon their slaves, andfor various violations of decent, morals, and comfort. Reasonand analogy seem to require that a human being, although thesubject of property, should be so far protected as the public mightbe injured through him.For all purposes necessary to enforce the obedience of the slave,and to render him useful as property, the law secures to the mastera complete authority over him, and it will not lightly interfere withthe relation thus established. It is a more effectual guarantee ofhis right of property, when the slave is protected from wanton abusefrom those who have no power over him ; for it cannot be disputed,that a slave is rendered less capable of performing his master s service,when he finds himself exposed by the law to the capriciousviolence of every turbulent man in the community.Mitigated as slavery is by the humanity of our laws, the refinementof manners, and by public opinion, which revolts at everyinstance of cruelty towards them, it would be an anomaly in thesystem of police which affects them, if the offence stated inthe verdict were not indictable. At the same time it is undeniable,that such offence must be considered with a view to the actualcondition of society, and the difference between a white man anda slave, securing the first from injury and insult, and the otherfrom needless violence and outrage. From this difference it arises,that many circumstances which would not constitute a legal provocationfor a battery committed by one white man on an other,LIABILITY OF OTHERS TO THE MASTER FOR, &c. 243would justify it, if committed on a slave, provided the battery werenot excessive. It is impossible to draw the line with precision, orlay down the rule in the abstract ; but as was said in Racket s case,the circumstances must be judged of by the court and jury, with adue regard to the habits and feelings of society. But where nojustification is shown, as in this case, I am of opinion the indictmentis maintainable.Hall, J. I concur in the opinion given. I think it would behighly improper that every assault and battery upon a slave shouldbe considered an indictable offence ; because the person makingit might have matter of excuse or justification on his side, whichcould not be used as a defence for committing an assault and batteryupon a free person. But where an assault and battery iscommitted upon a slave without cause, lawful excuse, or withoutsufficient provocation, I think it amounts to an indictable offence.Much depends upon the circumstances of the case when it happens; these circumstances are not set forth in this case, and Ithink it material that they should appear. I therefore think, thejudgment of the court below should be reversed, and a new trialgranted for that purpose.Henderson, J. concurred.4.THE STATE v. MANER. Spring T. 1834. 2 Hill s Rep. 453.;S.

For notwithstanding for some purposes a slave is regarded tei r of hisin law as a person, yet generally he is a mere chattel personal,and his right of personal protection belongs to his master, who canmaintain an action of trespass for the battery of his slave.There can be therefore no offence against the state for a merebeating of a slave unaccompanied by any circumstances of cruelty,or an attempt to kill and murder. The peace of the state is notthereby broken ; for a slave is not generally regarded as legallycapable of being within the peace of the state. He is not a citizen,and is not in that character entitled to her protection.244 SLAVERY.5.STATE v. MANER. Spring T. 1834. 2 Hill s Rep. 453.ron d ma P be ^^ defendant was indicted for an assault and battery, with anintent to murder a slave. O Neal J. held, that although at commonlaw no indictment lay for an assault and battery upon a slave, yetby lie act r lS2l -> Acts, p. 12. an assault with an intent to murdera slave is indictable. The act of 1821., changing the murder ofa slave from a mere misdemeanor, which it was under the act of1740, to a felony, and the attempt to commit a felony, whetherby statute or common law, is a misdemeanor, punishable by fineand imprisonment, at the discretion of the court.6.THE STATE v. MANN. Dec. T. 1829. 2 Devereaux s North CarolinaRep. 263.The mas The defendant was indicted for an assault and battery upon Lydia,lfa r ^ S than the slave of one Elizabeth Jones. On the trial it appeared, that theJbfaS- defendant had hired the slave for a year; that during the term thery commit slave had committed some small offence, for which the defendanthis slave, undertook to chastise her ; that while in the act of so doing, theslave ran off; whereupon the defendant called upon her to stop,which being refused, he shot at and wounded her. The judge inthe court below charged the jury, that if they believed the punishmentinflicted by the defendant was cruel and unwarrantable, anddisproportionate to the offence committed by the slave, that in lawthe defendant was guilty, as he had only a special property in theslave. A verdict was returned for the state, and the defendant appealed.Per Cur. Griffin, J. A judge cannot but lament, when suchcases as the present are brought into judgment. It is impossiblethat the reasons on which they go can be appreciated, but whereinstitutions similar to our own exist, and are thoroughly understood.The struggle, too, in the judge s own breast between the feelings ofthe man, and the duty of the magistrate, is a severe one, presentingstrong temptation to put aside such questions, if it be possible.It is useless, however, to complain of things inherent in our politicalstate. And it is criminal in a court to avoid any responsibility whichthe laws impose. With whatever reluctance, therefore, it is done,the court is compelled to express an opinion upon the extent ofthe dominion of the master over the slave in North Carolina. Theindictment charges a battery on Lydia, a slave of Elizabeth Jones.LIABILITY OF OTHERS TO THE MASTER FOR, &c. 245Upon the face of the indictment, the case is the same as The Statev. Hall, 2 Hawks Rep. 582. No fault is found with the rule thenadopted, nor would be, if it were now open. But it is not open ;for the question as it relates to a battery on a slave by a strangeris considered as settled by that case. But the evidence makes thisa different case. Here the slave had been hired by the defendant,and was in his possession ; and the battery was committed duringthe period of hiring. With the liabilities of the hirer to the generalowner, for an injury permanently impairing the value of theslave, no rule now laid down is intended to interfere. That is leftupon the general doctrine of bailment. The inquiry here is, whethera cruel and unreasonable battery on a slave, by the hirer, is indictable.The judge below instructed the jury, that it is. Heseems to have put it on the ground, that the defendant had but aspecial property. Our laws uniformly treat the master or otherperson having the possession and command of the slave, as entitledto the same extent of authority. The object is the same, the serviceof the slave ; and the same powers must be confided. In acriminal proceeding, and indeed in reference to all other personsbut the general owner, the hirer and possessor of the slave in relationto both rights and duties, Is, for the time being, the owner.This opinion would, perhaps, dispose of this particular case ; becausethe indictment, which charges a battery upon the slaveof Elizabeth Jones, is not supported by proof of a battery upondefendant s own slave ; since different justifications may beapplicable to the two cases. But upon the general question,whether the owner is answerable criminality, for a battery uponhis own slave, or other exercise of authority or force, not forbiddenby statute, the court entertains but little doubt. Thathe is so liable, has never been decided ; nor, as far as isknown, been hitherto contended. There has been no prosecutionsof the sort. The established habits and uniform practiceof the country in this respect, is the best evidence of the portionof power deemed by the whole community requisite tothe preservation of the master s dominion. If we thought differently,we could not set our notions in array against the judgmentof every body else, and say that this, or that authority, may besafely lopped off. This has indeed been assimilated at the bar to theother domestic relations ; and arguments drawn from the well-espublished principles, which confer and restrain the authority of theparent over the child, the tutor over the pupil, the master over the246 SLAVERY.apprentice, have been pressed on us. The court does not recognisetheir application. There is no likeness between the cases.They are in opposition to each other, and there is an impassablegulf between them. The difference is, that which exists betweenfreedom and slavery and a greater cannot be imagined. In theone, the end in view is the happiness of the youth, born to equalrights with that governor, on whom the duty devolves of trainingthe young to usefulness, in a station which he is afterwards to assumeamong freemen. To such an end, and with such a subject,moral and intellectual instruction seem the natural means ; andfor the most part, they are found to suffice. Moderate force issuperadded, only to make the others effectual. If that fail, it isbetter to leave the party to his own headstrong passions, and theultimate correction of the law, than to allow it to be immoderatelyinflicted by a private person. With slavery it is far otherwise.The end is the profit of the master, his security and the publicsafety ; the subject, one doomed in his own person, and his posterity,to live without knowledge, and without the capacity to makeany thing his own, and to toil that another may reap the fruits.What moral considerations shall be addressed to such a being, toconvince him what, it is impossible but that the most stupid mustfeel and know can never be true ; that he is thus to labor upon aprinciple of natural duty, or for the sake of his own personal happiness,such services can only be expected from one who has nowill of his own ; who surrenders his will in implicit obedience tothat of another. Such obedience is the consequence only of uncontrolledauthority over the body. There is nothing else whichcan operate to produce the effect. The power of the mastermust be absolute, to render the submission of the slave perfect. Imost freely confess my sense of the harshness of this proposition.I feel it as deeply as any man can. And as a principle of moralright, every person in his retirement must repudiate it. But in theactual condition of things, it must be so. There is no remedy.This discipline belongs to the state of slavery. They cannot bedisunited, without abrogating at once the rights of the master, andabsolving the slave from his subjection. It constitutes the curse ofslavery to both the bond and the free portions of our population.But it is inherent in the relation of master and slave. That theremay be particular instances of cruelty and deliberate barbarity,LIABILITY OF OTHERS TO THE MASTER FOR, &c. 247where in conscience the law might properly interfere, is mostprobable.The difficulty is to determine, where a court may properly begin.Merely in the abstract it may well be asked, which power ofthe master accords with right. The answer will probably sweepaway all of them. But we cannot look at the matter in that light.The truth is, that we are forbidden to enter upon a train of generalreasoning on the subject. We cannot allow the right of the masterto be brought into discussion in the courts of justice. Theslave, to remain a slave, must be made sensible that there is noappeal from his master ; that his person is, in no instance,usurped ; but is conferred by the laws of man, at least, if notby the lav of God. The danger would be great indeed, if thetribunals of justice should be called on to graduate the punishmentappropriate to every temper, and every dereliction of menialduty. No man can anticipate the many and engraved provocationsof the master which the slave would be constantly stimulated,by his own passions, or the instigation of others, to give ; orthe consequent wrath of the master, prompting him to bloody vengeance,upon the turbulent traitor ; a vengeance generally practisedwith impunity, by reason of its privacy. The court, therefore,disclaims the power of changing the relation in which these partsof our people stand to each other.We are happy to see, that there is daily less and less occasionfor the interposition of the courts. The protection already affordedby several statutes, that all powerful motive, the private interest ofthe owner, the benevolence towards each other, seated in thehearts of those who have been born and bred together, the frownsand deep execrations of the community upon the barbarian, whois guilty of excessive and brutal cruelty to his unprotected slave,all combined, have produced a mildness of treatment, and attentionto the comforts of the unfortunate class of slaves, greatly mitigatingthe rigors of servitude, and ameliorating the condition ofthe slaves.The same causes are operating, and will continue to operatewith increased action, until the disparity in numbers between thewhites and blacks shall have rendered the latter in no degree dangerousto the former, when the police now existing may be furtherrelaxed. This result, greatly to be desired, may be much morerationally expected from the events above alluded to, and now inprocess, than from any rash expositions of abstract truths, by ajudiciary tainted with a false and fanatical philanthropy, seeking to248 SLAVERY.redress an acknowledged evil, by means still more wicked andappalling than even that evil. I repeat, that I would gladly haveavoided this ungrateful question. But being brought to it, thecourt is compelled to declare, that while slavery exists amongst usin its present state, or until it shall seem fit to the legislature tointerpose express enactments to the contrary, it will be the imperativeduty of the judges to recognize the full dominion of the ownerover the slave, except where the exercise of it is forbidden by statute.And this we do upon the ground, that this dominion is essentialto the value of slaves as property, to the security of the master,and the public tranquility, greatly dependent upon their subordination; and, in fine, as most effectually securing the general protectionand comfort of the slaves themselves. Judgment belowreversed ; and judgment entered for the defendant.7.SCIDMORE v. SMITH. Aug. T. 1816. 13 John s Rep. 322.The statute Trespass for harboring the plaintiff s man servant.

Porter, J. This is an action brought to recover for kfmngthe price of a negro whom the plaintiff charges the defendant with a slave pre-havingshot and killed. The evidence on which the jury found a evidenceverdict, comes up on the record, and the defendant renews here, a thTverdict.motion which he unsuccessfully made in the court below, for anew trial, on the ground of the finding being contrary to law andevidence. The testimony , it has been argued, is weak, and it isperhaps so ; but the act charged here is one rarely committed inpresence of witnesses ; and the most that can be expected in casesof this kind, is the presumptions that result from circumstances.A most respectable jury, who knew the parties, have found a verdictin favor of the plaintiff, and we are unable to say the evidenceauthorizes us to reverse the judgment rendered therein. We believejustice has been done, and when the proceedings of the inferiorcourt terminate there, as we think they have in the instancebefore us, a stronger case than this must be presented, to induceus to send the cause to a new trial. Judgment affirmed.2.Jordan v. PATTON. July T. 1818. 5 Martin s LouisianaRep. 615.Per Cur. JUatheios, J. The plaintiff claims damages for an if on aninjury done to one of her slaves, by one of the defendant s. She j^^ave*obtained judgment ; and the defendant appealed. The injury done the plaintiffto the slave was of such a nature as to render him wholly useless : his full va-hisonly eye having been put out. The parish court decreed that property isthe plaintiff should recover twelve hundred dollars, the supposed trans e redto the devalue of the slave, and a further sum of twenty-five dollars a fendant,onmonth, from the time he was deprived of his sight ; and that the th^judg-defendant should pay the physician s bill and two hundred dollars mentfor the sustenance of the slave during his life, and that he shouldremain for ever in the possession of the plaintiff. We are of opinion,that this judgment is erroneous, in giving damages for the fullvalue of the slave, and compensation for the loss of his labor,from the time he became blind, during an undetermined period.250 SLAVERY.Further, it is thought to be erroneous, in decreeing that the defendantshould pay two hundred dollars for the subsistance of theslave, and that he should remain forever in the possession of theplaintiff. The most that could have been equitably claimed, in additionto the full value of the slave, was legal interest thereon ;which, though it could not be given as interest, upon an uncertainand unliquidated sum, might have been taken into view, in estimatingand fixing the damages. In the present case, from a comparisonof the testimony, as to the value of the slave, we are ofopinion that full and complete indemnity has been given for a totalloss. When the defendant shall have paid the sum thus decreed,we are of opinion that the slave ought to be placed in his possession,deeming that the judgment making full compensation to theowner operates a change of property. In this view of the case,that part of the judgment of the parish court,, which orders the defendantto pay two hundred dollars, is evidently erroneous. Theprinciple of humanity, which would lead us to suppose that themistress, whom he had long served, would treat her miserableblind slave with more kindness than the defendant, to whom thejudgment ought to transfer him, cannot be taken into considerationin deciding this case. Cruelty and humanity ought not tobe presumed against any person. A remedy for them can only beapplied, when they are legally proven. The judgment of theparish court being erroneous, in these points, it is ordered, adjudgedand decreed, that it be annulled, avoided, and reversed ; andthis court, proceeding to give such judgment as, in their opinion,ought to have been given in the court below, it is further ordered,adjudged, and decreed, that the plaintiff recover from the defendantthe sum of twelve hundred dollars, as an indemnification forthe value of the slave, and that she shall further recover the amountof all expenses incurred for the attendance and treatment of theslave, with costs of suit in the inferior court.S.STATE v.

CHEATWOOD.

WILLIAMS. May T. 1827. 17 Martin s LouisianaRep. 695.Per Cur. Mathews, J. This is an action of trespass, in which In an actionthe plaintiff claims damages for the loss of a slave which she alleges ge s forto have been killed by the defendant s. They severed in theiranswers to the petition, and separate verdicts and judgments were slave >rendered against them. Williams alone appealed. Two bills of permittedexceptions are found in the record, which must be disposed of. . u t " eThe first is to the opinion of the judge, a quo, by which he author ^"|^ t ? niced the plaintiff to strike out a count in her petition, which relate defendedto the conduct of the appellant as an overseer. The alleges manage-tonsin that part of the petition had no relation to the trespass inwhich the slave was destroyed ; but only charged the overseer withgross negligence and mismanagement of the plantation and slavesof the appellee. It, in truth, was a declaration of facts, makingan entire and distinct cause of action. This part of the suit wasdismissed, by leave of the court, after the cause was submitted tothe jury ; but not until Williams had been allowed to amend hispleas, by discontinuing a claim in recommendation for wages asoverseer. Under such circumstances, and in pursuance of thecode of practice, we are of opinion, that the court below did noterr in permitting the plaintiff to discontinue that part of her suitwhich related to the neglect and bad conduct of the defendant asoverseer,252 SLAVERY.6.THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI v. JONES. June T. 1820. Walkers Rep. 83.In the state Per Cur. Clarke, J. The question in this case, arising in 8 " rest f judgment, transferred on doubts from Adams superiordermaybe CO hurt, is, whether, in this state, murder can be committed on acommittedby the kill slave. Because individuals may have been deprived of many ofslave, as their rights by society, it does not follow, that they have been rive( l f a ^ their rights. In some respects, slaves may be consista free tered as chattels, but in others, they are regarded as men. Thelaw views them as capable of committing crimes. This can onlybe upon the principle, that they are men and rational beings. TheRoman law has been much relied on by the counsel of the defendant.That law was confined to the Roman Empire, giving thepower of life and death over captives in war, as slaves, but it no moreextended here, than the similar power given to parents over the livesof their children. Much stress has also been laid by the defendant scounsel, on the case cited from Taylor s Reports, decided in NorthCarolina; yet, in that case, two judges against one were of opinion,that killing a slave was murder. Judge Hall, who delivered thedissenting opinion in the above case, based his conclusions, as weconceive, upon erroneous principles, by considering the laws ofRome applicable here. His inference, also, that a person cannotbe condemned capitally, because he may be liable in a civil action,is not sustained by reason or authority, but appears to us to be indirectopposition to both. At a very early period in Virginia, thepower of life over slaves was given by statute ; but Tucker observes,that as soon as these statutes were repealed, it was at onceconsidered by their courts, that the killing of a slave might be murder.Commonwealth v. Dolly Chapman ; indictment for maliciouslystabbing a slave under a statute. It has been determined in Virginiathat slaves are persons. In the constitution of the United States,slaves are expressly designated as " persons." In this state thelegislature have considered slaves as reasonable and accountablebeings, and it would be a stigma upon the character of the state,and a reproach to the administration of justice, if the life of a slavecould be taken with impunity, or if he could be murdered in coldblood, without subjecting the offender to the highest penalty knownto the criminal jurisprudence of the country. Has the slave norights, because he is deprived of his freedom ? He is still a hu*LIABILITY OF OTHERS TO THE MASTER FOR, &,c. 253man being, and possesses all those rights of which he is not deprivedby the positive provisions of the law ; but in vain shall welook for any law passed by the enlightened and philanthropic legislatureof this state, giving even to the master, much less to a stranger,power over the life of a slave. Such a statute wouldbe worthy the age of Draco or Caligula, and would be condemnedby the unanimous voice of the people of this state, whereeven cruelty to slaves, much less the taking away of life, meets withuniversal reprobation. By the provisions of our law, a slave maycommit murder, and be punished with death, why then is it notmurder to kill a slave] Can a mere chattel commit murder, andbe subject to punishment ?Villeins, in England, were more degraded than our slaves. It istrue, that formerly the murder of a villein^was not punished withdeath, but neither was the murder of a freeman then so punished.The only difference between the freeman and the slave was in themagnitude of the fine. In England, killing a villein was as muchmurder as killing a lord. Yet villeins were then the most abjectslaves, and could be bought and sold as chattels ; but becauseslaves can be bought and sold, it does not follow that they can bedeprived of life. The right of the master exists not by force ofthe law of nature or nations, but by virtue only of the positive lawof the state ; and although that gives to the master the right tocommand the services of the slave, requiring the master to feedand clothe the slave from infancy till death, yet it gives the masterno right to take the life of the slave ; and if the offence be notmurder, it is not a crime, and subjects the offender to no punishment.The taking away the life of a reasonable creature, underthe king s peace, with malice aforethought, express or implied, ismurder at common law. Is not a slave a reasonable creature ?is he not a human being ] And the meaning of this phrase, reasonablecreature, is a human being. For the killing a lunatic, anidiot, or even a child unborn, is murder, as much as the killing aphilosopher ; and has not the slave as much reason as a lunatic, anidiot, or an unborn child ? All are in the king s peace, exceptalien enemies, flagrante belli. A distinction once existed inEngland, between the killing a Dane and a Saxon ; but even inCoke s time the killing any rational being was murder. Jews werethen regarded in a light more odious than the most abject slave ;yet to kill them was murder. So, to kill one attainted, or an outlawedfelon, or even an alien enemy, except in battle, might be254 SLAVERY.murder. The term, " king s peace," means the place where thecrime is committed, the actual venue, and not a particular class ofhuman beings.At one period of the Roman history, a history written in theblood of vanquished nations, slaves were regarded as captives,whose lives had been spared in battle, and the savage conquerormight take away the life of the captive, and therefore he mighttake away the life of the slave. But the civil law of Rome extirpatedthis barbarous privilege, and rendered the killing a slave acapital offence. When the northern barbarians overran SouthernEurope, they had no laws but those of conquerors and conquered,victors and captives ; yet, even by this savage people, nodistinction was recognized between the killing, in cold blood, aslave or a freeman. And shall this court, in the nineteenth century,establish a principle too sanguinary for the code even of theGoths and Vandals, and extend to the whole community, the rightto murder slaves with impunity ?The motion to arrest the judgment must be overruled.7.COMMONWEALTH v. CARVER. June T. 1827. 5 Rand s Rep.660.A negro The prisoner was indicted for feloniously, maliciously, and unsprotected law f u % shooting, with intent to maim, disfigure, disable, and kill,by the act a negro man slave of the name of Armistead, the property of ,a- 6 drew Houten, under the act of 9th of February, 1819. Thesaw D fui Un J ud S e Doubted whether a negro slave is the subject or person onshooting, which the offence created, and the penalties prescribed by the act&c. by 9 a can be committed or incurred, adjourned the case to the generalfree person* COUrt.The Court. Brockenbrough, J., after referring to Dolly Chappie scase, 1 Virgg. Cas. 184., declared, that a slave was a person onwhom the offence of stabbing and shooting might be committed ;and that the act was intended to protect slaves as well as free personsfrom such outrages.It may be further remarked, that there appears no reason, arisingfrom the relative situation of master and slave, why a free personshould not be punished as a felon for maiming a slave. Whateverpower our laws may give to a master over his slave, it is as importantfor the interest of the former, as for the safety of the latter, thata stranger should not be permitted to exercise an unrestrained andson.LIABILITY OF OTHERS TO THE MASTER FOR, &c. 255lawless authority over him. The opinion of the court is, that judgmentought not to be arrested.FIELDS v. THE STATE OF TENNESSEE. Jan. T. 1829. 1 Yergers Rep. 156.Whyte, J. The plaintiff in error was indicted in the circuit The feto-- nous slay-courtof the county of Maury, for the murder of a negro man j n sofaslave, named Peter, the property of a certain David Jeffries. JjJEatUpon the indictment he pleaded not guilty. The jury found malic f a u 1 ! bhim not guilty of the murder as charged in the bill of indict ter.ment, but guilty of the manslaughter, in feloniously slaying thenegro slave Peter.Upon the verdict it was moved, for the plaintiff in error by hiscounsel, that no judgment should be rendered against him, becausethe jury found him guilty of manslaughter only, whichcrime, where the person slain was a slave, does not in point of lawexist. The court overruled the motion in arrest of judgment, andpassed sentence upon him, that he be burned in the brawn of theleft hand, be imprisoned thirty days, and pay the costs of the prosecution.From which judgment an appeal, in the nature of awrit of error, was taken to this court. It was contended for theplaintiff in error, in a very able and learned argument, that thecommon law of England ought not to guide the investigation, andgovern the decision of this question ; for that slavery never existedin England, and, therefore, the principles of the common lawcould not have in view, nor in any part be founded upon a state ofsociety which had no existence in that country. That, althoughthe colonial government of England, or Great Britain, extendedto these states before the revolution, yet the law of nations, onwhich slavery depended, and the municipal regulations of eachgovernment on the subject, formed the code of laws by which allquestions regarding slaves should be governed ; and, therefore,the law of nations, with municipal regulations, or legislative actsof the colonial government of North Carolina before the revolution,and the acts of assembly of North Carolina and Tennesseesince the revolution, should govern this case. That by the law ofnations, as it formerly existed, the master had an absolute and unlimitedpower over the life and fortune of his slave ; that in latertimes, municipal law has abridged this power of the master, and256 SLAVERY.produced amelioration in the state of slaves. But this ameliorationor abridgment of the power of the master, is only co-extentsive with the municipal assumption, leaving with him that portionnot expressly taken away. From this view it follows, that thewilfully or maliciously killing, with malice aforethought, a negroor mulatto slave, being made murder, and the offender punishablewith death, without benefit of clergy, by the act of 1799, ch. 9.,does not include or embrace any other kind of homicide but theone mentioned ; and the jury in the present case, having foundthe plaintiff in error guilty of manslaughter, being a different andinferior grade to that stated in the act, is not an offence within it ;and there being no other act of assembly, making a felonious andwilful killing of a slave punishable, the judgment of the circuitcourt is erroneous. We cannot concur with the view the learnedcounsel has taken of this case, and assent to the position, that thecommon law, or its principles, are not to have an influence inthe decision of this case. It is true, as observed in the argument,that pure and proper slavery never subsisted in England, givingthe master the power of life and death over the slave ; but a speciesof slavery, or servitude, existed there from the earliest times ;the subjects of it were not styled slaves, but villeins ; and theirstate and circumstances much resemble that of our slaves at thepresent day. These villeins were either regardant, that is, annexedto the manor or land, or villeins in gross, or at large ; thatis, annexed to the person of the master, or lord, as he is called inthe books. Both classes were transferable by deed from one cornerto another; neither could leave their master without his permission; and if they ran away, or were purloined from him,might be claimed and recovered by action like beasts and otherchattels.The children of villeins were also in the same state of bondagewith their parents, but followed the condition of their father free,if he was free ; and villein, if he was villein ; differing in that respectwith the condition of our slaves, when the maxim of the civillaw, that partus sequitur ventrem prevails. Neither could the villeinacquire property for his own benefit, the maxim applying quicquidacquired servo, acquired domino ; nor could he support an actionagainst his master for beating him, which privilege the mastercould always exert with impunity, as no civil remedy lay for himagainst his lord. Such was the civil relation existing between theLIABILITY OF OTHERS TO THE MASTER FOR, &c. 257master and villein at the common law. See 2 Black. Com. 93, 94. ;Litt. S. 129. 194. ; Co. Litt. 117. a. But whilst the common lawnoticed and sanctioned these harsh characteristics of the villein scondition, it guarded his person as an object of the criminal law;and protected him against the atrocious injuries of his lord ; for hemight not kill or maim him ; and for these he shall be indicted atthe suit of the king, 2 Black. Com. 94. ; 1 Inst 11G, b. ; Litsec. 194.This short review of the condition of villein at the common lawexhibits a strong resemblance to the condition of our slaves ; theprincipal feature of both are the same, and differing only in someminutia, which do not require to be noticed. Why then do not theprinciples of the common law apply, as far as the state or condition issimilar, the one to the other? Our ancestors brought, upon theiremigration, the common law with them as their rule of action, andstill retain it where applicable. So it was declared upon the firstsettlement of North Carolina, in the act of 1715, ch. 31., sec. 6.So, also, after the revolution in 1778, it is again declared, "that allsuch parts of the common law as were heretofore in force and usewithin this territory, as are not destructive of, repugnant to, or inconsistentwith, the freedom or independence of this state, and theform of government therein established, and which have not beenotherwise provided for, in the whole or in part not abrogated, repealed,or expired, are hereby declared to be in full force in thestate." Act of April, 1778, ch. 5. sec. 2.By the common law, murder, according to Lord Coke, 3 Inst47., is " where a person of sound mind and discretion unlawfullykilled any reasonable creature, in being, under the king s peace,with malice aforethought, either express or implied;" manslaughter,by Blackstone, 4 Com. 191., is defined to be "the unlawfulkilling of another, without malice, either express or implied." Boththese definitions include the villein, and the negro or mulatto slave.Our act of assembly of 1799, ch. 9. sec. 1., enacts, "that if anyperson shall wilfully and maliciously, with malice aforethought,kill any negro or mulatto slave whatsoever, on due and legal convictionthereof, in any superior court of the district wherein suchoffence shall have been committed, be deemed guilty of murder, asif such person, so killed, had been a freeman, and shall sufferdeath without benefit of clergy ; any law, usage or custom, to thecontrary notwithstanding." This statute makes the same act murer,and punishable with death, which is so At the common law.258 SLAVERY.If it is asked then, why was this statute made if the same act wasmurder and punishable with death at the common law 1 it was madein consequence of the prior act of 1774, having enacted, that the killinga slave under such circumstances that would have constitutedmurder by a freeman doing so, should be punished only withtwelve months imprisonment for the first offence. This act havingso far superceded the common law on the same matter, the legislaturewilling it, in 1799, that this act of 1774, should be repealed,and the common law be restored ; instead of a repeal in terms,made an express provision on the same subject matter, operatingas a repeal, and enacting that the killing, which by the act of 1774was punishable only by twelve months imprisonment, should bepunishable with death. It is now said that by these acts no suchcrime exists in our law as manslaughter, or the wilfully end feloniouslykilling a slave ; for that the municipal regulation of thecourts, or, in other words, the acts of assembly, do not in terms,or otherwise, declare its existence. It is answered, that the legislaturein the acts of 1774 and 1799, legislated upon a set of factsconstituting murder; and the act of 1784 says, when the subjectof them is a slave, the punishment is twelve months imprisonment.Now, if after the passage of the act of 1 784, it would be a correct constructionto say, that as murder, which is a more heinous offencethan manslaughter, is made only punishable by imprisonment fortwelve months, therefore, the less offence of manslaughter does notexist ; or if it does exist, is not punishable at all Would it not be anequally correct construction to say, that the repeal of this act of1774, by the act of 1799, was a repeal of its imputed consequencesand construction, as well as of its express enactments. But thecase is, that neither the act of 1774, or the act of 1799, speak ofmanslaughter, or the state of facts which constitute the offence ofmanslaughter in law. On the other hand, it may be safely said,that if there is no act of-assembly of North Carolina, or of the territorialgovernment, or of our own government, the offence ofmanslaughter, when a negro or mulatto slave is the subject of it,from our criminal code, exists by the common law : because it isthe unlawful killing of a human being ; and this definition of theoffence is as well applicable to the negro or mulatto slave, as thevillein.We have already seen, that by the common law, the villein wasprotected, as to his life and limbs, against the atrocity of the lord orowner. This case is that of a stranger committing the act, andnot the lord or owner. This matters not, for the law is the sameLIABILITY OF OTHERS TO THE MASTER FOR, fcc. 259in both cases : if there were a difference by analogy to their civilcivil rights, it would operate against the stranger. Thus, an actionof assault and battery cannot be supported by the villein against hislord, for, being his servant, he had a right to beat him at pleasure,not extending to life or member, but to the like action by the villein.Versus nan dominion, non valet el exceptio, quia est serves alienus,ex quo nihil ad ipsum, utrum liber sit non serves. If being his serves,was a good answer by the lord, in an action of assault and battery,but riot available for him on indictment for homicide or mayhem,still less must be that of alienus serves in the mouth of a stranger,upon the like indictment.The judgment rendered in the present case is upon a verdict ofth? jury given on an indictment for murder, finding that the plaintiffin error is not guilty of the murder charged in the bill of indictment; but he is guilty of manslaughter in feloniously slayingthe negro slave, Peter. It is the same judgment that would havebeen rendered against the plaintiff in error, if the subject of thehomicide had been a freeman, instead of a negro slave. There isno law authorizing any distinction between the two cases. Therewas no distinction at common law between the judgments in homicide,for the killing a freeman, and killing a villein. The words oflord Coke are express to this point ; he says, " he that killed hisvillein, should have the same judgment as if he killed a freeman."1 Inst. 116. b. It may be also observed, that the finding of thejury in this case, is the usual finding upon a bill of indictment formurder, where the facts of the case admit of it, and is a proceedng at common law, and sanctioned by it. See 1 Black. Com.48., where he says, " the common law, properly so called, is thatlaw by which proceedings and determinations in the king s ordinarycourts of justice are guided and directed."Peck, J. Defendant was indicted in the circuit court of Maurycounty, for the murder of a negro slave. He pleaded not guilty ;and at the trial was found guilty of wilful and felonious slaying ofthe slave aforesaid.The prisoner had his plea of clergy allowed, and judgment forthe offence of manslaughter was pronounced against him ; fromwhich judgment he has prosecuted this writ of error. It is nowinsisted, that the wilful and felonious slaying of a slave is not punishable; and for this is cited, 2 Hayww. Rep.; 1 Taylor Rep.; Actof 179: for the state, 1 Hawks Rep. Murder, says sir EdwardCoke, 3 Inst. 47., is when a man of sound memory, and of the260 SLAVERY,age of discretion, unlawfully killed, within any county of therealm, any reasonable creature, in rerum natura, under the king speace, with malice aforethought, either express or implied. Blacksstone, in his Commentaries, vol. 4. p. 194, remarks : "at the crimeof wilful and deliberate murder human nature starts with horror ;"and which, says he, " is, I believe, punished throughout the worldwith death." The Mosaic law and the precepts to Noah, are allso many denunciations against the crime. From remotest antiquitydown to the present time, mankind, in deliberating upon it, haveformed the same opinion. But it will be answered, none will disagreeabout the crime of murder. The question made is, whetheror not the crime here found that of slaying a slave is a crimepunished by the laws of this State ? Our act of the assembly of1799, ch. 9., provides, " that if any person or persons shall, wilfullyor maliciously, with malice aforethought, kill any negro ormulatto slave whatever, on due and legal conviction, he shall bedeemed guilty of murder, as if such person so killed had been afreeman ; and shall suffer death without benefit of clergy." Thisact, it is said, creates the offence, and fixes the punishment for themurder of a slave ; and it is not thence to be inferred, that anyother killing, not mentioned in the act, was designed to be punished,or even considered as a crime. This argument is founded on whatis said to be the law of nations ; that captives taken in war aresubject to be made slaves ; and the captor has a right to dispose ofthe life of his captive, and for this Vattel is cited. The positionabove assumed, I conceive, is too broad. When a captive has laiddown his arms and submitted, there is then no necessity for disposingof his life ; and nothing but necessity or unavoidable accident,will excuse taking away life. If no necessity exists for destroyinga captive human being, how can it be pretended the act can be excused.Vattel, 421.Christian nations do not consider themselves at liberty to sportaway the lives of captives. At this day the act would be reprobatedand denounced as fit only for the savage state. Indeed,Christian example has greatly softened, in this respect, the ferocioussavage in his wars. It has been argued by a jurist, that theslave of this country, when taken in his own country, was subjectto this law ; that the dealer in the slave trade purchased the captivethere with this burden attached to him, and hence it is, thatthe law affords him no protection against the attempt of the masterupon his life. That the law of a pagan or savage nation, shouldLIABILITY OF OTHERS TO THE MASTER FOR, <fec. 261have been acquired with the commodity purchased and ferriedover the wave with it, is a doctrine too monstrous for my mind ;for had the slave on his passage touched in Britain, the commonlaw would have protected his life against the assault of his master.That common law was in force in the colonies. The attempt toimpart and commit a principle so opposed to those founded incommon law and suited to Christian communities, would he as futileas the attempt to unite oil with water. How can it be urged,that of necessity the horror of slavery must not abate when introducedhere, from the degraded condition it was found in where ithad its origin. If it is true, as argued, that we bring the law ofthe country with us ; then a slave brought from those islands,where it is said the captor sometimes turns cannibal, kills andmakes a repast of his captive for the same reason, having thelaw and example of that country before us, it could be as safelyfollowed here. And, ludicrous as this may seem, it falls exactlywithin the train of that argument, which can only be supported bysupposing the slave on a footing with the live stock on a farm.I have been taught that Christianity is a part of the law of theland.The four gospels upon the clerk s table admonish me it is so everytime they are used in administering oaths. If the mild precepts ofChristianity have had the effect to ameliorate the condition of thisorder of people, it is expected that we must recede from the improvementobtained, and retire more into the dark, and become ingovernment, partly Christian and partly pagan, because we ownpagans or savages for our property ! If the argument on the otherside is correct, this consequence would follow : the whole train ofthinking is erroneous, and it is not difficult to trace the origin of theerror. Those in early times, concerned in the traffic of slaves,were unfeeling and savage. The page of history proves thatthousands fell victims to masters, some before, and some afterlanding. Man is imitative. The cruelty first practised was followedup, and a bad custom against all law was winked at. But in latertimes, when murder did cry out, justice demanded her recompensefor crime ; and some were indicted ; acts of assembly had beenpassed ; and the offence having been so common, it was prettynatural to overlook the principle of the common law, and followsuch rules as were found in the statute ; but common law, becauseof this oversight, had not ceased. It was regained, and greatly tothe honor of the bench of N. Carolina.262 SLAVERY.This statute of ours has not repealed the law as it stood beforethe passage of this act. It is much more sensible to sa, it is affirmativeof the common law; an attempt of the legislature to againbring into action what courts had, unfortunately, but too long permittedto slumber.What is conclusive with me, that this is all that was intended, is,the punishment inflicted by the act. For wilful and malicious murder,the offender is to suffer death without the benefit of clergythe former punishment. Say, that for a time the law, as it stoodbefore, had been misconstrued or overlooked, if the court had revivedand restored it to its pristine vigor, would not, in its restoration,the crime of manslaughter have been restored also ? Certainlyit would. If, then, the act is silent as to manslaughter, and therebe no repeal of former laws, what pretence is there to say, thatmanslaughter is done away ? I admit this will depend upon thequestion, whether the killing a slave with malice, was an offence atcommon law. Hut does not the common law definition cover thecase ? Is it the wilful and malicious killing of a. reasonable creature ?if he be such, then the reasoning is unsound and inconclusive,which offers as an excuse, that such reasonable creature is a slave.It is well said by one of the judges of North Carolina, that the masterhas a right to exact the labor of his slave ; that far, the rightsof the slave are suspended ; but this gives the master no right overthe life of the slave. I add to this saying of the judge, that lawwhich says thou shalt not kill, protects the slave ; and he is withinits very letter. Law, reason, Christianity arid common humanity,all point out one way.Catron, J., concurred. Judgment affirmed.9.BOOTH et al. v. SCHOONER L ESPERANZA.

FOR PROPERTY GIVEN TO, OR CONTRACTS MADE BY THESLAVE.1.LIVAUDAIS HEIRS v. Fox et al. May T. .1820. 8 Martin sRep. 161.Per Cur. Mathews, J. This is a suit brought by the appel A masterITl3.y Siglees, plaintiffs in the court below, to recover the amount of a note, for what isgiven by the defendants to Frosina, a slave of the plaintiffs, by slavewhich they promised to pay to her four hundred dollars. Paymentis resisted on the ground of the promise having been madein error, and, consequently, having created no obligation, it beinga contract without cause or consideration. The execution of thenote raises a presumption of a just consideration, which must bedefeated by proof to the contrary, on the part of the defendants.This they have attempted by the production of a testament madeby one Durand, in which he instituted Pedro, his bastard child byFrosina, the slave abovementioned, his heir, and appointed Noneof the appellants, his testamentary executor; and by the introductionof testamental proof, showing that the child died in1812, &c. Admitting that all this evidence was properly receivedin the present suit against Fon, and another person, on their jointnote, which is by no means clear, we are of opinion, that it is notsufficient to support the defendant s objections to payment. Forany thing, which appears to the contrary, the boy Pedro, the institutedheir of Durand, was the slave of the plaintiffs, or theirancestor, and took the instrument under the will for their benefit,in conformity with the laws then in force. The right to the successionbeing thus vested in them, they might have instituted anaction for its recovery against the executor. This they have notdone, but now sue upon a note given by him, and another to theirslave Frosina ; being, as the appellants insist, a liquidation of Pedros succession to his mother, which she could not take in consequenceof her state of slavery. The former having died since thepromulgation of the civil code, that statute, 40 art. 17. and 158.,art. 64:., is relied on to establish the error, and consequent nullityof the defendant s promise to pay the sum to Frosina, as stipulatedin their note.According to the first of these provisions, being a slave, she wasincapable to contract any kind of engagement It is true, that she264 SLAVERY.could not bind herself in any respect, because she was without awill ; nor could she have entered into any contract which would bebinding on her owner, unless under special authorization by horn.But it does not appear to us to follow, as a necessary consequence,that the master cannot claim the benefit of a lawful and voluntaryengagement made in favor of his slave, on an equitable consideration,by a person capable of contracting.By the last article cited, slaves are declared to be incas able oftransmitting their estates, as intestate, or of inheriting from others.They certainly can transmit nothing, for they do not possessany thing in their own right ; neither can they inherit, clearly notfor themselves ; and perhaps not for the benefit of their masters.The same incapacity is attached to them, of giving and receivingby donation inter vivos, or causa mortis ; they therefore cannot takeby will for themselves. In pursuance of these rules, Frosina couldnot succeed to the estate of her son ; but the owners had a right toclaim it from the testamentary executor of Durand ; and havingthis right, it cannot properly be said that no cause or considerationexists for the note by which he promised to pay that amount,when it is seen that such promise enures to the benefit of thosewho have a just and legal claim to the succession of Pedro. Consideringthe note as a liquidation of this succession, there is sufficientcause for the contract thus made hy the executor, and hasbeen rightfully condemned to pay the sum therein stipulated ; butought to be exonerated from any other or farther claim againsthim, on account of the estate willed by Durand to his bastardchild.2.ROBINSON v. GULP. Nov. T. 18J2. 1 Constitutional CourtRep. of South Carolina, 231.This was an action on the case, for procuring, persuading, andenticing a negro slave to depart and absent himself from the derbyAkin s Alabama Dig. p. 109., it is declared, "that any person or personsbeing convicted of harboring, or concealing any negro or negroes belonging to anyother person or persons, whatsoever, or suffering the same to be done with his consentor knowledge, shall be fined in a sum not exceeding seven hundred dollars, andLIABILITY OF OTHERS TO THE MASTER FOR, &c. 265vice of his master. The presiding judge stated to the jury, thatan act of assembly of this state made it a felony for a person to inveigle,entice, &c., a negro slave to absent himself from his master ;and, therefore, if they were of opinion that the defendant in thiscase had committed the act clandestinely and secretly, he wasguilty of a felony, and the plaintiff could not recover ; because thecivil action was merged in the crime. The jury found for thedefendant, and this motion is made to set aside that verdict, andto grant a new trial, on the ground of misdirection by the court.JVbW, J. I can see no good reason why a civil action shouldbe merged in a felony in any case where property is involved,and the action is for the property itself. In England, a convictionfor felony works a forfeiture of property, and to suffer an actionto be brought before conviction, would discourage prosecutions,and deprive the king of this part of his revenue ; and, therefore,a person is not permitted to sue until after conviction. Butno such reason exists here, because there is no forfeiture. Butthat is not the only ground upon which I have formed my opinion.I do not think the question ought to be tried in this collateralway ; and much less ought it to be in the defendant s mouth, todischarge himself from the action by saying, he had committed afelony. Whenever a person sets forth a good cause of action, inhis declaration, and supports his allegations by proof, I think heought to recover, notwithstanding the testimony may be such asto induce a belief that the transaction is felonious. A personought never to be convicted of a felony, except on a direct chargeof a crime, and by a jury charged to try the offence. If the plaintiffhad charged a felony on the face of his declaration, it wouldhave been a question on which it is unnecessary to give anyopinion at present. And yet, I think he might make use ofthe very words of the act, and still be entitled to recover. Inan action brought to try the right of property, the words of the actmay be proper words to use in the declaration. Suppose it shouldbe proved that the defendant committed the act in a clandestine,secret manner ; still his object might be only to get possession ofshall be imprisoned not less than one calendar month, nor exceeding six calendarmonths; and shall be liable in damages to the party injured, to be recovered byaction on the case before any tribunal having competent jurisdiction." And similarenactments are to be found in the statute books of the other states.266 SLAVERY.property to which he had a claim, and not with a felonious intention.In an action to try the right of property, quo animo, makesno part of the case. And it is no answer to say, that if the defendanthas any right, he may show it ; for after the plaintiff hasestablished his right, the defendant may he satisfied that it is invain to contend farther. Indeed, in such a case, it would be forhis interest not to do it, if he might thereby give the case the appearanceof felony, and nonsuit the plaintiff, after having establisheda right to the property. I am of opinion a new trial oughtto be granted.Justices Bay and Grime concurred.(XVIII.) OF RUNAWAY OR FUGITIVE SLAVES,1.GLEN v. HODGES. Jan. T. 1812. 9 John s Rep. 67.A fugitive Trespass for taking the plaintiff s man slave. The plaintiff, thetracing" owner of the slave, went into Vermont after his runaway slave,other sta a te Wn had fled fr m him in this State) ^ had resided in Rutland,will not Vermont, four years as a freeman. After the slave was taken bycreditor the plaintiff, the defendant took out an attachment against the slavetaking ly him ^> r de K on which he was arrested and forcibly taken out of theon a pro p ] a i n tiff s possession, and sent to prison. The judge who tried thecess out of rthe hands cause thought the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, and a suit was entered, with liberty to move the court to set it aside,him the Per Cur There is no doubt the negro was the property of thecontract plaintiff, and had run away from service in Vermont. He was heldSlave being to service or labor under the laws of this state, when he escaped,and the escape did not discharge him ; but the master was entitledto reclaim him in the state to which he fled. This is according tothe provision in the constitution of the United States, art. 4. 2.,and the act of Congress of the 12th of Feb. 793., Laws U.States, vol. 2. p. 165., prescribes the mode of reclaiming the slave.It not only gives a penalty against any person who shall knowinglyand willingly obstruct the claimant in the act of reclaiming thefugitive, but saves to such claimant " his right of action for any injury"he may receive by such obstruction. The plaintiff was,OF RUNAWAY OR FUGITIVE SLAVES. 267therefore, in the exercise of a right, when he proceeded to reclaimthe slave ; and the simple question is, whether the defendant is notresponsible in trespass, for rescuing the slave, though he did it underthe form and color of an attachment for a debt, alleged tohave been contracted with him by the slave. The negro being aslave, was incapable of contracting so as to impair the right of hismaster to reclaim him. A contrary doctrine would be intolerable,so far as it respects the security of the owners right, and wouldgo to defeat the provision altogether. The defendant, therefore,contracted with the negro, and sued out the attachment at his peril.It was a fraud upon the master s right. The fact being established,that the negro was a fugitive slave, the attachment was nojustification to the party who caused it to be sued out. This musthave been so adjudged, if the point had been raised in Vermont,because the entering into a contract with such slave, and the endeavorto hold him under that contract, contravened the law of theUnited States, which protects the master or owner of fugitive slavesin all his rights as such owner. If the slave had committed anypublic offence in Vermont, and had been detained under the authorityof the government of that state, the case would have beendifferent, and the right of the master must have yielded to a paramountright. But the interference of any private individual, bysuing out process, or otherwise, under the pretence of a debt contractedby the negro, was an illegal act, and void ; and there canbe no objection to the action being brought here, though the acthappened out of the state. The action is transitory.Motion for a new trial granted.2.THE COMMONWEALTH v. Galloway. January T. 1817.3 Serg. & Rale s Rep. 4.Habeas Corpus to the keeper of the Philadelphia prison, at the A fugitiveinstance of the master, to bring up the body of David Johnson, his has^com!slave, who had been committed for fornication and bastardy. muted fornicationIt was contended, that the master could not take away his slave and bastardwith a crime. That it had been so decided by Judge be delivered,in Nov. 1816, and before the Chief Justice, 1814,Per Cur. Tilghman, Ch. J. From the evidence which has less securitiesgiven, we have no doubt of David Johnson being the slave of to maintainMr. Frazier; and there would be no objection to delivering him up l268 SLAVERY.to him, but for the commitment for fornication and bastardy. Fornicationhas always been prosecuted in this state as a crime. Bythe law of 1705, it was subject to the punishment of whipping, orthe fine of 10 pounds, at the election of the culprit. The punishmentof whipping has been since abolished ; but the act of fornicationis still considered as a crime ; and where it is accompaniedwith bastardy, security must be given to indemnify the countyagainst the expense of maintaining the child. It may be hard onthe owner to give this security, or lose the services of the slave;but it is an inconvenience to which this kind of property is unavoidablysubject. The child must be maintained ; and it is morereasonable that the maintenance should be at the expense of theperson who has a right to the service of the criminal, than at that ofthe people of this city, who have no such right. I am of opinion theprisoner should be remanded. Yates and Gibson, Js., concurred.3.Barrett v. HIGBEE. Oct. T. 1827. 5 Monroe s Rep. 546.Taking up Jarrett brought trespass against Higbee for taking and imprisoningrunaw ayhl his slave. Defendant pleaded that he apprehended the slave as afnd d upon runaway > r > &c - The defendant admitted, that when he took thereasonable slave up, he produced the following pass or paper from his master :a justification all men by these presents, that I, J. Jarrett, of Livingston,and state of Kentucky, do agree that this black man Allen, dobargain and trade for himself until the first day of May next ; andalso for to pass and repass from Livingston county, Kentucky, toMonongahela county, state of Virginia, Morgantown, and then toreturn home to the same Livingston county, Kentucky, again, nearthe mouth of Cumberland river, Maitland. Given under my handthis 26th day of Sept. 1822."The plaintiff moved the court to instruct the jury, that if theybelieved that the slave was possessed of the pass produced in evidence,and did exhibit it to the defendant when taken up, and thatthe same was executed and delivered to the slave by the master,it should have protected him, and his arrest was illegal. Thecourt refused to give the instructions prayed for ; but instructedthe jury, that if the defendant took up the slave in good faith, havingreasonable grounds to suspect he was a runaway, he wasjustifiable.Per Cur. Bibb, Ch. J. The instructions asked, supposes thatHigbee, and all others, were bound at their peril to yield obedienceOF RUNAWAY OR FUGITIVE SLAVES. 269to the permit contained in the paper exhibited. To this the courtcannot assent. The paper contains, on the part of the plaintiff, anagreement that the slave shall bargain and trade for himself, fromthe 26th September, till the first of May, and pass and repass fromLivingston in Kentucky, to Morgantown in Virginia. Howeverwell satisfied the master may have been to turn his slave looseupon society, to bargain and trade for himself, and to ask societyto it, yet it does not follow that society was bound to submit to it.Without attempting to define what shall be the form of a lawfulpass, or permit, to a slave, it may be safely affirmed, that nopaper can be such a one, which on its face is a violation of publicpolicy, and the security of society ; which shows that the slave isgoing at large, to do that which is forbidden expressly by thestatute law. That slaves shall not be frivolously arrested, whenproceeding on the lawful business of the owner, or when acting intheir proper and lawful sphere, by permission of the owner, is dueto the master and his right of property. That the master shall notlet loose his slave, with a permit from him to violate the establishedorder and economy prescribed by law in relation to slaves, is dueto society. These interests of the master on the one hand, and ofsociety on the other, are concerned in the question involved in thiscontroversy. But without abridging the lawful powers of the master,to use his property in the slave, it may be safely declared thatthis paper given by the master in the slave violated that duty whichhe as owner owed to the laws and to society.The paper contained the master s assent and permission to theslave to go at large from September to May ; from Smithland toMorgantown, to bargain and trade for himself, contains an authorityto hire himself, as well as to buy and sell, and deal in articlesand commodities without a specification or limitation. Thesepermissions, and such acts of the slave, are violations by masterand slave, of the policy, spirit, and letter of the statute 16th Dec.1802, against permitting slaves to go at large and hire themselves.2 Dig. 1 159.; and the 12th sect, of the act of 1789, 2 Dig. 1152.,against buying, selling, or receiving to, or from, or by a slave withouta note in writing from the master expressive of the article. Topass and repass from Smithland to Morgantown, from the extremesouthwestern to the northeastern limit of the state, and beyondinto Virginia, to range in this direction from September to May,bargaining and trading for himself, is certainly going at large in270 SLAVERY.hostility to the settled order intended to be maintained by our statutes.Such licenses would tend to beget idle and dissolute habitsin the particular slaves so indulged, as well as in others, and leadto depredations upon the property of others, and to crimes andinsubordination. To such licenses and indulgences society arenot bound to submit ; the master has no right to give such. Everyperson to whom such a permit was exhibited by a slave, mightwell suspect its authenticity. It was not a lawful pass or permit,it was a species of temporary and unlawful manumission ; unlawfulin its purpose and duration, wanting the solemn form, sanction,authentication, and safeguard, as a deed of emancipation, and byits terms and purposes, showing that the slave was not proceedingupon the lawful business of the master, but at the will and for thepurposes of the slave himself.4.Barrett v.

As the vision under consideration in this case was made on the circuit bymede is by the j edge Q f the first district, by art. 5. sec. 2. of the constitution,against the it becomes my duty to report to the supreme court the reasonsr upon which that opinion was founded. This was not a hasty, RUNAWAY OR FUGITIVE SLAVES. 271considerate decision, made in the hurry of business at nisi-prius.On the contrary, it was made under all the advantages that anelaborate research of six months could bestow, surrounded withcomplete libraries, and with ample time for thought and reflection.The case is an action of detinue for a runaway slave, by the originalowner against the vendee at sheriff s sale. The single pointpropounded for investigation and decision fully appears in the billof exceptions which is made a party of the record.The cause was considered by the circuit court in three aspects :1. Upon the strength of decided cases in point, and the weightof authority to be found in analogous decisions.2. As a vexed question, to be determined upon the reasons ofthe case, with a view to public policy, and the state of society, wherethe rule was to operate, as law hereafter, in similar cases,3. As a new question, and difficult, when considered with aview to the past, present, and future sales of a similar nature in aslave holding state. On the part of the plaintiff, it was insistedupon the first point, that this was a naked power, not coupled withan interest, and that in order ta make the sale valid, every pre-requisiteto the creation and execution of the power should precedeits completion ; and cited 4 Wheaton s Rep. 77. 79.; Williams v.Peyton, 4 Cranch s Rep. 403.; Steel s exr. v. Course, 9 Cranch sRep. 64. ; Parker v. Rule s lessee, and Sudden on powers, wererelied on. On the part of the defendant it was contended, thatthese cases in Wheaton and Cranch did not apply : because there,the decisions went entirely upon the ground of notice to the originalproprietor, in whom the property remained until the sale hadactually taken place ; but in the case of a runaway slave, or anestray, so soon as the time of the first publication expired, accordingto law the property in the runaway slave vested in the county,the same as an estray at common law, vested in the king, or lordof the liberty. Jacob, 441 ; 1 Black. Com. 297., and cases therecited. It is said an estray is any valuable animal that is not wild,found within a lordship, and whose owner is not known ; in whichcase if it be tried and proclaimed according to law, and not claimedby the owner within a year and a day, it belongs to the king, withouteven the equity of redemption. So, by our runaway slavelaws, R. C. page 376-7., and Estray Laws, S. B. page 331., afterbeing proclaimed according to law, in the case of a runaway slave,six months, and in the case of an estray twelve months, the slave,or estray, belongs to the county, to be sold according to law ; and272 SLAVERY.in both these cases the provisions of the statute are purely directory; and whether complied with, or not, cannot affect the title ofthe vendor at such sale, without fraud ; who, upon the strictestrule of caveat emptor is only required to see the pre-requisites tothe property vesting in the county, had been complied with, andpreserve them as monuments of his title. In a much strongercase than the present, reported in 4 Dall. Rep. 220., the court sayit has been urged, that there is no proof that advertisements of thesale were posted up at public places ; but if the sale was a fair one,we regard this as a very feeble objection.The act of making such advertisements is the duty of the sheriff;is a matter merely directory, and should not affect the title of abonafide purchaser ; and I think the case would be a much harderone, if the original proprietor of a runaway slave could be permittedto disturb the title of a bonafide vendee at sheriff s sale, on accountof irregularity in the sale, subsequent to the title vesting in thecounty. If the amount of sale has been diminished for want of legalnotice to purchasers, his remedy, if any, is against the officersas in other cases. In this case, all the pre-requisites to vesting thetitle in the county, were complied with, and the plaintiff s claim isthe amount of the proceeds of sale, after deducting costs, chargesand commissions. One reason why the cases from Wheaton andCranch do not apply here, is because those cases were decidedupon the ground that there was a defect of notice to the proprietor: here the proprietor had a strict legal notice in every particularp re-requisite. But the most striking feature which redeemsthis case from the operation of all the authorities cited by the plaintiff,with reference to private special powers, is, that in those casesan actual sale in strict pursuance of the power, is necessary to ainvestiture of title ; but in this case, the title is good before thepre-requisites of sale commenced. When an execution is placedin the hands of the sheriff, it constitutes a general lien upon all theproperty of the defendant ; and when a levy is actually made, theproperty is in the sheriff, pro tanto, for all the purposes of sale tosatisfy the execution. And in such cases, the law protects bonafide purchasers without fraud, although the sheriff may render himselfliable for misconduct. In accordance with this doctrine, it islaid down in 2 Bacon, 741 (a.) if upon his judgment, the plaintifftakes out a writ of fieri facias and thereupon the sheriff sells a termfor years to a stranger, and the judgment is afterwards reversed,the defendant shall only be restored to the money for which theOF RUNAWAY OR FUGITIVE SLAVES. 273term was sold, and not the term itself; for by the writ, the sheriffhad authority to sell, and if the sale may be avoided, afterwards,few would be willing to purchase under execution, which wouldrender writs of execution of no effect2d. Although this doctrine contemplates the reversal of ajudgment, and the subversion of the authority by virtue of whichthe execution issued, yet, in order to protect the bonafide purchasersand grant titles, the sale under such circumstances will beheldvalid,Again, in the case of Goodyire v. Price, Cro. p. 246., the questionwas moved, whether, { on the reversal of a judgment for error,under which, by writ of elicit, a lease for years of tithes hadbeen delivered to plaintiff, in satisfaction of his debts,) the partyshould be restored to the lease itself, or the value for which thesheriff had delivered it. The court unanimously determined, thatthe lease should be restored ; for, say they, " there is a differencebetween the delivery upon an elicit to the party himself, and asale to a stranger upon a fieri facias, for the fieri facias authority tothe sheriff to sell ; wherefore, when he sells a term to a stranger,although the execution is reversed, yet he shall not, by virtuethereof, be restored to the term, but to the monies, because he becomesduly thereto, by act of sale."In unison with these authorities was the determination of JudgeSpencer, in the suit of Sandford v. Rosa, 12 Johns. Rep. 162. Thata sale of lands even on a junior execution was good, and the courtremarked : " the only remedy the one whose execution was firstdelivered has, is by action against the sheriff." Notwithstanding,in this instance, the property sold was bound and subject to theelder execution, yet, the sale thereof, under the junior executionswas pronounced legal and valid ; doubtless on considerations ofpublic policy and expediency. If a sale of real property or lands,under such circumstances, conveys a good title to the purchaser,a fortiori, a disposition of personal estate, under like circumstances,will vest an indisputable title in the vendee. In the caseunder consideration, by the expiration of six months, and due publicationmade during that period of the apprehension, incarceration,and description of the slave in controversy, as required by thestatute, the absolute title to him, analogously to the doctrine ofestrays, vested in the county. If this conclusion be undeniable,the plaintiff then, it follows irresistibly, cannot maintain this action,though the sale were void. The statute having divested him of the274 SLAVERY.property, his right of action is gone ; and in such cases the maximof law is "portion est conditio defendants"The statute provides, on the subject of runaway slaves, that anadvertisement describing the person, &c., inserted in some publicnewspaper, for the space of six months, and no owner havingclaimed, and proved his right thereto, at or before the expirationof six months, it shall be lawful for the sheriff to sell, c. Onan observance of these pre-requisites mentioned, an absolute poweraccrues to the sheriff to sell, and with regard to authority, his situationis the same as if acting under the sanction of a judgment of acourt of record : he is equally empowered by the one, as by theother; and these provisions of the statute, which prescribe the termsof sale to the officer, whether under execution, or a runaway slave,under the statute, are purely directory, as before contended; andshould any of the minutiae be omitted by the sheriff, it will notinvalidate the sale, but, if it sell for a less amount, on account ofsuch omission, indemnification may be obtained upon his officialresponsibility. The principles here contended for, are recognizedand established by an authority, or case, in 2 Bibb s Rep. 402.(202.) This case was entirely analogous to the one underconsideration. It was an action for the recovery of slaves, &c. In2 Bay s Rep., is also a case in point. Such are the reasons, andsuch the authorities upon which the decision below was founded.If a runaway slave be considered in the light of an estray, thenthe original proprietor loses his title under the six months* advertisementand proclamation ; and he must then rely upon the purchasemoney, or go upon the officer for damages. And in thesecond place, if it be lawful for the sheriff to sell on the expirationof six months, the requisitions of the statute, as to the mannerof sale, are purely directory, and the vendee, without fraud, is protectedin his title against the owner, where remedy is the same as inother cases where the power to sell accrues by operation of law.As to the other consideration ; if this is to be considered a newor vexed question, or, as the English judges sometimes term it, anintegral point. I believe the gentlemen of the bar, as well as thecourt, are unanimous in the opinion, that the judgment oughtto be affirmed ; it is, therefore, neither necessary nor expedient todiscuss those points again.OF RUNAWAY OR FUGITIVE SLAVES. 275G.LABRANCHK v. W ATKINS. June T. 1816. 4 Martin s LouisianaRep. 391.Per Cur. Martin, J. The plaintiff complains that the defend A runawayant detains his negro slave. The defendant answers, that the slaveran away, and was delivered to him as jailor ; that he advertised and b .y th e she-detainedhim during the time prescribed by law, and finally sold years afterhim, after having obtained the permission of the parish judge ; that th *he has since bought the vendee s title to the slave, under which he tenement.now holds him. The facts, as agreed upon by the counsel of theparties, are these : The slave was brought to jail on the 20th ofJuly, 1813 ; and on the 16th of August, the defendant wrote to aperson in New Orleans to advertise the negro three times, accordingto practice. There is no other evidence of any compliancewith the defendant s directions in this respect, except a newspaper,bearing date of the 3d of September, 1813 ; and the 29th ofAugust, 1815, the sale took place. There is not any date to thepetition of the defendant for the judge s leave, nor to the judge sorder thereon. The only fact stated in this petition is, " that thenegro had been confined as a runaway two years, completed onthe 29th of July, 1815." The compliance with any requisites ofthe law is not alleged ; it is not stated that the negro was notclaimed. The slave was sold by the defendant to Henry Wyatt,who immediately afterwards, viz. on the same day, conveyed allhis rights therein for the price at which it was sold to him. Theplaintiff produced a notarial act of sale, as evidence of his title,which does not appear to have been questioned. On the 20th ofSeptember, 1814, he sent his son to claim the negro, with a letterto the parish judge, complaining, that from the defendant s neglectto advertise the negro, as the law requires, he had not till then anyknowledge of his confinement. Eighty dollars were offered to thedefendant for his charges ; but he claimed one hundred and eighty.On the acknowledgement of the defendant s deputy, that thenegro had been advertised in one paper only, the parish judgemade an order for his delivery, on payment of two months expenses,and the fees of arrest ; but the defendant refused to deliverthe negro thereon. It is admitted that the negro was sick ; thatat the time of the plaintiff s application the doctor s bill amountedto eight dollars, and afterwards rose to forty-one ; that he was notconfined, worked out, and attended the defendant s deputy as aservant. On these facts, the district court gave judgment, that the276 SLAVERY,plaintiff recover the negro from the defendant, and one hundredand eighty-five dollars and twenty-five cents for hi damages ; andthe defendant appealed. The 28th section of the first part of theblack code provides, that runaway slaves shall he advertised, in atleast two newspapers, in French and English, during three monthssuccessively, and, after that time, once a month during the remainderof the year. They shall be employed and kept at work forthe county, by whom clothing, medicine, attendance, and maintenanceshall be found ; but these expenses shall he discharged bythe owner, when the negro cannot be usefully employed.The next section provides, that if the owner do not reclaim thenegro within two years from the date of the advertisement in thenewspaper, in compliance with the preceding section, he shallhe sold by the sheriff, with the permission of the judge, after threeadvertisements, for the payment of the charges, to be fixed by thejudge. Now, the case under consideration does not appear, iron,the petition or order, to be one in which the sale could be ordered.The negro is stated to have been in jail two years ; but the lawallows only the sale of slaves who have been unreclaimed during twoyears not after the arrest, but after the date of the first advertisement.The parish judge can only order the slaves advertised forone year ; the ease on paper does not show that the negro was advertisedat all. Admitting even that the order justified the sale,(which we clearly think it does not,) the testimony on record showsthat no legal sale has taken place. The defendant sold to himself.Wyatt lent his name. This fact results from the evidence spreadon the record. A runaway negro is delivered to the jailor, whoneglects advertising him according to law ; the owner, however,hears of the capture of his slave, makes himself known, claims hisproperty, tenders more than is due,yet the slave is withheld . The jailorobtains an order of sale, without any allegation or proof of thecase being one in which the law authorises a sale ; he sells the slaveafter oneadvertisement,while the law requires three ; executes a deedof sale to a man, who instantly transfers all his right to the jailor.We are of opinion, that the order of sale was rendered in a case inwhich the judge who granted it, from the very proceedings, doesnot appear to have had any authority to exercise. It consequentlymust be viewed as a nullity. The defendant, from the testimonyin the case, made a fraudulent attempt to divest the plaintiff fromhis title in the slave. The damages allowed to the latter do notappear to us too high. Judgment affirmed, with costs.OF RUNAWAY OR FUGITIVE SLAVES. 2777.PALFREY v. RIVAS. Jan. T. 1820. 7 Martin s Louisiana Rep.371.Martin, J. The petition charges, that the defendant having arrestedthe plaintiff s runaway slave, instead of pursuing the meanskeeps himwhich the law directs, in order to secure mm, kept horn at work four or fiveon his own plantation for fourteen or fifteen days ; after which theslave escaped, and has never been heard of since. There was sen 1 . s im ~mediatejudgment for the defendant, and the plaintiff appealed. From the word to thestatement of facts, which consists of the depositions of a number faring to ""of witnesses, it appears, that the defendant arrested the plaintiff s hJm^andslave on a Sunday, secured him in strong iron fetters, and informed the latter,1 , . A .,~ ~ , . enters intothe painting ol the capture, proposing to purchase the slave. He a treatyalso procured a gentleman of the neighborhood to address the an^nTheplaintiff on the same subject. Both letters reached (he plaintiff, who mean timeimmediately addressed the gentleman who had written, at the de escapes,fendant s request, enclosing a small sum to defray the expenses of findthe capture, and requesting him to inform the defendant that he J r j he de ~iGndciiitymight have the negro for a price which was then fixed. In the theseusduring the night between the Thursday and Friday followingthe slave s arrest, he effected his escape. In the letter ofthe plaintiff to his friend, desiring him to offer the slave for sale tothe defendant, he requested that, if the offer was not accepted, theslave might be taken to a blacksmith, put in irons, and kept till anopportunity to send him to New Orleans presented itself; but, ifnone could be had shortly, that he might be sent to jail. The fettersput on him by the defendant are sworn to have been verystrong, and in the opinion of the witnesses such as precluded theidea of his escape. The defendant, it appears, treats thus the negroeswhom he arrests, and makes no charge against the owners.The plaintiff relies on the act of 1816, 2 Martin s Digest, 514.n. 6., which provides, that whenever a slave shall be apprehended,he shall be taken before the parish judge, or the next justice of thepeace, who shall make inquiry as to his name, and that of his owner,and send him to jail, &c. He contends, that as the defendantdid not comply with the requisites of the law, he must be liablefor the consequences. On the part of the defendant, it is insisted,that the positive charge in the petition, viz. that the slave was keptat work for the defendant is disprove, and the implied charge ofa neglect to comply with the requisites of the act cited, is not presentedas a substantial cause of action, which the defendant was278 SLAVERY.bound to disprove. We are of opinion that the petition chargesthe neglect of the defendant in a manner sufficiently positive toput him on his defence. The act requires a person who takes upa runaway slave to carry him before a magistrate, but it does notfix any particular time for doing so. The taker up cannot be expectedinstantly to abandon his own work, and go, accompanied byhis own negroes, to the justice, A reasonable time must be allowedfor that purpose. And this is a matter of fact. If he has businessof his own pressing on him, which does not admit of a delay,he may secure the runaway during a reasonable time. If the ownerresides nearer to him than the justice, he may well send himword to come and take his slave away. If the latter escape in themean while, it is not clear that the taker up is to bear the loss.Nemine debet suum officium esse noceosum. Taking up a runawayslave is generally a kindly office. No private man is bound toundertake it.It is true, the law provides a compensation, but few persons demandor accept it, and the defendant appears to be one of those.The law of this case is pretty plain ; and the jury who passed onit had but two facts to consider : Did the defendant neglect tocarry the slave to a magistrate for too long a time 1 Did not theplaintiff approve of the slave being kept as he was 1 They havefound for the defendant generally ; and we are far from seeingthat they erred. This is certainly a very hard action, and everyallowance must be made in favor of the defendant, who acted withthe best intentions, desirous of avoiding any useless expense to theplaintiff, and who treated the slave in the very manner in whichplaintiff desired he might be treated, if the defendant did not purchasehim. The jury, who knew the situation of the defendant,his distance from the next magistrate, and his ability to spare handsto guard the slave on the way, have said the plaintiff ought not torecover.The plaintiff, in two letters, before and after he heard of theescape of the slave, does not appear to have disapproved did notcomplain of the conduct of the defendant. On the contrary, heused expressions therein, which might be construed into an approbationof his conduct ; and if the verdict was grounded on a beliefthat it was approved and ratified by the plaintiff, we cannot saythat the jury erred. Upon the whole, the verdict and judgmentappear to us correct.OF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 2798.SKINNER v. FLEET. Aug. T. 1817. 14 John s.

SARAH. June T. 1830. 4 J. J. Marshall sRep. 103.Enoch Smith, an abolitionist, bought Sarah, the wife of negroThe owner Bells a ft . ee man o f co i or an d sold her to Ben, in 1809, for thepurpose of being emancipated, and took Ben s notes at long creditsin payment. Smith, the vendor, wished Ben to liberate his wifewithout delay, as he was becoming embarrassed, and he might beeventually unable to do it in consequence of the claims of his creditors.A deed was prepared by Smith in the year 1813, ; nd executedby Ben, in which he emancipated his wife and her children.Ben had not paid Smith the amount of the notes given for Sarah.S-.nith lived some years after, and always recognized Sarah andher children as free persons.Ben died intestate in 1818, and Smith in 1825. Ferguson washis executor, and was also appointed administrator of Ben, andtook Sarah and her children, and was about selling them for thepurpose of satisfying the debt due from Ben to Smith, for tl.e priceof Sarah. A bill was filed, alleging these facts, and an injunctionawarded restraining the sale. The answer alleges, that the rightsof the testator, as creditor, were not impaired by his agency ineffecting the emancipation. The circuit court perpetuated theinjunction.Per Cur. Robinson, Ch. J. Ferguson, as administrator of Ben,had no interest in the plaintiffs, nor any right to control them.Pre-existing creditors of Ben, who did not assent to the deed ofemancipation, might disregard it so far as their just claims mightbe affected by it. For the maxim, that a man must be just beforehe is generous, was applied to the emancipator by the act of assemblyof 1798, (2 Dig. 1155.,) whereby the rights of creditors,and all others, except "the heirs or legal representatives" of theemancipator are saved.But after manumission, the person so liberated is free as againstthe emancipator, and the world besides ; excepting only bonafidecreditors, or some other person who had a better right to the slavethan the person had, who attempted the liberation; and as to suchcreditor, his right does not nullify the act of emancipation, norOF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 28otherwise affect it, farther than as a lien for the ultimate securityof the debt.The person emancipated is no part of the assets in the hands ofthe personal representatives of the emancipator. The emancipationbeing effectual against the emancipator, must be equally soagainst his heir and personal representatives. And the act of assemblyexpressly declares, that it shall be equally so against themall.As administrator of Ben, Ferguson had no right whatever to thecustody of the defendants in error, nor had he as executor of Smith ;The act of 1798 would have saved the right of E. Smith, as thecreditor of Ben. But it would have saved it, just as the commonlaw and the statutes for the prevention of gifts, grants, or devisesifl^fraud of creditors will protect their rights from the fraud or prematuregenerosity of their creditors. The law will not allow thehonest creditor to be defrauded of his just rights by the collusiveor voluntary alienation by the debtor of his property. But if thecreditor be privy to the alienation, and assent to it, it is not fraudulent,nor inoperative as to him. Violent nonjit injuria. In this case thetestator was not only privy to the emancipation, but urged and assistedin effecting it. Decree perpetuating the injunction affirmed.TRUDEAU S EXR. v. ROBINETTE. Jan. T. 1817. 4 Martin sLouisiana Rep. 577.Per Cur. Martin, J. The plaintiff claims the defendant as a A deed ofemanci passage; stating her to be a mulatto woman born from a negro woman, tion of athe slave of his testator; avers that she pretends to be free, and is certe ageabout to sail for the island of Cuba. Her answer denies everyfact in the petition. Judgment has been given for her in the districtcourt, and the plaintiff has appealed. The case comes upona statement of facts, and a bill of exceptions. The statement apprisesus, that at the trial, before a jury, the plaintiff introduced abill of sale from his testator to Gardette, and a reconveyance fromGardette : the first, of March 20th, 1809, the other of April 17th,of the same year. The defendant first introduced a letter of theplaintiff s testator of October lath, 1808, containing the followingexpressions: "Robinette, a child of my house, having alwaysacted in a manner different from that of girls of her color, I amhappy that she finds the opportunity of securing her happiness,282 SLAVERY.especially at the eve of the day when her young mistress is underthe necessity of calling her back near her, or of replacing her."The testator then offers her to Gardette for 1000 dollars.2. A bill of sale of Robinette from James Mather, styling himselfattorney in fact of George Mather and Aurone, the wife of saidGeorge, one of the testator s daughters, of July 1810, to A. Abat.3. Another, from the latter to A. D. Bureau, of the 22d ofDecember, of the same year.4. One from the latter to the defendant s mother, now, and then,a free negro woman, of Sept. 10, 1811.5. A deed of emancipation of the defendant, dated July 21,1812.6. The record of a suit, instituted by George Mather and wifeagainst Abat, for a part of the price of the defendant. Gardette,a witness introduced by the defendant, deposed, that he had knownher for ten years past; that she is the person he bought from theplaintiff *s testator ; that she always passed as the plaintiff stestator s slave, and he hired her as such ; that he believes thetestator knew of the sale of the defendant by Mather to Abat,because he was told so by the family, and the bargain was madeat the house of one of the testator s daughters.Lozane, another witness, introduced also by the defendant, deposed,that the defendant had been in the enjoyment of her freedomfor some years past ; that Gardette, the other witness, liveswith and has three or four children by her. The plan tiff provedthat he had taken up and confined the defendant, but that she wasliberated on a habeas corpus.To the introduction of the deed of emancipation, as evidence,the plaintiff objected, it appearing illegal on its face. The defendantwas stated in it to be of the age of twenty-fours a fact whichwas not denied, while the law forbids the emancipation of slavesunder that of thirty. 1807, 18, sect. 2. A bill of exceptions wastaken to the opinion of the court, overruling this objection ; and insealing it, the judge stated his reasons as follows : "I allowed theact of emancipation to go to the jury for what it was worth,although at the time I considered it immaterial to the real issue ofthe case whether it was legally executed or not.

If the evidence was immaterial to the issue,why admit it? We are of opinion that the document, had it beena legal one, would have been most material, a sine qua non piece ofevidence. But we think it was illegal, null, and void ; the officerwho received it having done so in contempt, if he was not ignorant,of the law A slave, considered as an object of property, isa thing, and as such, not entitled or capable to resist the exerciseof ownership on him (as an actor in a suit, or on a writ ofhabeas corpus, nor as a defendant) on account of a want of titlehi the person who claims or uses him as his property. If he bringsuit, or be sued on a claim of property on him, the issue can onlybe liber vel non. If he prove his freedom, no title can exist in hisopponent, till his freedom be proven ; there is no person to standin judgment with the claimant, who therefore could neither availhimself of, nor be concluded by, the judgment. Civil Code, art.19.; Black Code, 1816, 33. Sect. 16. Here the defendant clearlyappears to have been a slave, and there is no evidence of emancipation.If the plaintiff has parted with his title to a known person,who is unwilling to incur the risk and expense of a trial, and doesnot insist on his right, the slave has no capacity to resist. If theowner be unknown, it is as if he did not exist. If he be known,and absent, the court below might have appointed a person to interferein his behalf. Owners ought not to be subjected to supportor exhibit their titles, contradictorily with their slaves. Wheneverthe issue liber vel non is found in their favor, the court must givejudgment for them, without any inquiry into the title. As this inquirywould not avail them against other claimants, it would bewrong to prejudge, by trying the claim, the rights of others.It is, therefore, ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that the judgmentof the district court be annulled, avoided, and reversed, andthat the plaintiff do recover the defendant Robinette, and that shereturn to him as his slave.284 SLAVERY.4.SAWNEY v.

The question turned upon therent rule i issue of freedom or slavery of the appellant, it appeared a Mrs.Kentucky. Reed had owned him, and had executed a deed of manumission,and acknowledged it to be her act and deed before two persons.The court rejected this evidence.Per Cur. Mills, J. By the act of 1800, 2 Litt. Rep. 387., itis enacted, " that every person of the age of 18 years, being possessedof, or having a right to, any slave or slaves, may, by his orher last will and testament, or by an instrument of writing, emancipatesuch slave or slaves." By the express words of this act thepower is granted to emancipate, by a will, or instrument of writing,so that, whenever the instrument of writing is made by that person,the emancipation is complete. The seal is dispensed with. If theact of emancipation goes so far as the completion of what may betermed an instrument of writing, that is, a writing declaring its object,and signed by the party, the appendage of a seal is not necessary.The proof of the acknowledgment is dispensed with, sofaras it constitutes an essential ingredient in the manumission.Since the passage of the act, we conceive that a writing emancipatinga slave is placed on the footing of a will after the death ofthe testator, or a deed before its enrolment, and after the executionand delivery. It is valid, and passes the estate.OF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 2856.JULIEN v. Languish. Jan. T. 1821. 9 Martin s Louisiana Rep.205,Per Cur. Martin, J. The petition states, that Peter Langlish, j f ^>mnow deceased, being 1 in his lifetime the owner of the plaintiff, a slave, unablack man, emancipated him on the 24th of October, 1814, by anotarial act, after having fulfilled all the formalities which the lawrequires. The act has a suspensive clause, by which a condition his masteras before,is annexed to the emancipation of the plaintiff, who was thereby till hisbound to continue to serve the said Peter, as before, till his, thesaid Peter s death, when the plaintiff was fully, and without furtherrestriction, to enjoy his freedom. The plaintiff alleges, that in or attempt toder to comply with this condition, he ever since, gratefully and hTmto ac-exactlyas before, served the said Peter, and regularly paid himtwenty dollars per month, in conformity with an agreement on that compensatemade between them, and rendered him other services, when S ervices,herequested, till the 23d of April, 1818. In the course of which year t a a ot his bthe said Peter instituted a suit against him, and one B. Scions, in freedom afterthe mas-theparish court, to have the aforesaid deed of emancipation an ter s death,nulled ; in which suit, the said Peter finally failed. 5 Martin s Rep.405. The judgment of the supreme court thereon pronounced,on the 23d of March, 1818, had scarcely become final, when,on the 8th day of the following month, the said Peter executedwhat is called a deed of revocation of this deed of emancipation,before a notary, and on the 23d, the plaintiff was, through the agencyof several ill-disposed persons, who availing themselves of theold age and infirmities of the said Peter, had prevailed on him toexecute the deed of revocation, arrested, and deprived of every articleof property, even of his clothes, dragged to jail and inhumanlywhipt : whereupon, in order to prevent the recurrence of suchabuse, he resorted to the authority of the law, and instituted a suitagainst the said Peter, which he was afterwards advised to, and diddiscontinue. The petition further charges, that the said Peter, on the9th of December following, instituted the present defendant hisheir ; and he now, the said Peter having since died, wrongfullyclaims and detains the plaintiff as a part of the testator s estate.The answer states, that the plaintiff is, and has been a slave, and isthe property of the defendant ; that the pretended deed of emancipationis null and void ; that, admitting its legality, it cannotavail the defendant, being a donatio mortis causa, and having been286 SLAVERY.revoked. The general issue is pleaded. The district court gavejudgment for the plaintiff, being of opinion that " the act of emancipationwas executed in due form of law, and the plaintiff acquiredby it an absolute and indefeasible right to his freedom, as the persontherein mentioned ; and between the execution of the act andthe death of said Peter, the latter had the same rule and authorityover the plaintiff as he had before ; but the right of freedom, havingonce been acquired, could not afterwards be altered or forfeitedby any act of the plaintiff, or his master, because it is unalienable."The defendant appealed. The documents which come upwith the record, are the acts of emancipation and revocation ; theproceeding in the suit brought by Peter Langlish, to have the firstact annulled, and in the suit brought against him by the presentplaintiff, referred to in the petition.The deed of emancipation purports, that Peter Langlish, " bythese presents, gives freedom to his negro slave, named Julien, 46years of age, gratuitously, and to remunerate him for his fidelityand former services, and those he is to render him until his death ;which freedom is given under the express condition, that he shallserve his present master as before till he die ; after whose death heis to enjoy it fully, without any opposition or contradiction fromany person whatever. Wherefore, au moyen de quoi, he divestshimself, and parts with all his right of property and actions onthe said slave Julien, in order that he may deal, contract, sell, purchase,make a will, and enjoy all the privileges of a freeman, afterthe grantor s death."Boisgobert deposed, that Peter Langlish told him, the plaintiffshould never serve any other master after his death ; that the plaintiffalways conducted himself well, and never ran away. It is inthe deponent s knowledge, that the plaintiff continued to serve hismaster faithfully, until he was put in prison.About ten years ago P. Langlish told this deponent, that theplaintiff worked in town, and paid him eighteen dollars per month.The deponent then lived on the Bayou, and now lives on the Bayouroad. P. Langlish lived at the Metadrie, about a league and ahalf from town. The deponent has since been frequently in theneighborhood, and seen the plaintiff coming out of his master splantation with vegetables. A number of other witnesses testifiedto the same fact. The jailor deposed, that the plaintiff was broughtto the jail on the 23d of April, 1818, and whipt. This was done,and he was detained on the verbal order of the defendant, by oneOF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 287Valour, who conducted the plaintiff to the jail. The latter remainedthere till released by an order of court, on the 23d of Mayfollowing.Juillet saw the plaintiff when he was going to jail, and askedhim what was the matter. He replied, that his master, who wasan old rogue, sent him to jail, and wanted to deprive him of hisliberty. Another witness deposed to the same fact. Beauties deposed,that he knew P. Langlish for twenty-two years ; that heenjoyed his mental faculties till his death.The deed of revocation bears date of the 18th of April, 1818.P. Langlish therein declares, in general terms, that he has "justand valid motives to change his dispositions," and revokes and annulsthe act of emancipation.We are of opinion, that the plaintiff has not proved that he fulfilledthe condition on which he was to be free at his master sdeath, and it is in proof that he did not. He refused to serve himas a slave, and was desirous of compelling him to accept, in lieuof his services, a monthly compensation of eighteen dollars. Hebrought a suit for this purpose, which he afterwards discontinued.The testimony of Juillet, and the witness who followed him, showthat he insisted on enjoying his freedom before the death of hismaster, since he charged him with being an old rogue, who wasseeking to deprive him of his freedom. It is, therefore, ordered,adjudged, and decreed, that the judgment of the district court beannulled, avoided, and reversed, and that there be judgment forthe defendant.7.FISHER S NEGROES v. Dabs and others. March T- 1834.6 Yerger s Tennessee Rep. 119.On the 31st of July, 1827, Peter Fisher made and published ^feLn-his last will and testament, and therein, among other things, pro cheatingvide and directed as follows, to wit : " I give my negroes, all of not validthem, their freedom, and a right to live on my tract of land fifteen O f this dWyears ; also, there is to be laid out of my present crop, one year s J^ te r j h ^ utsupport; there is to be laid oft a sufficient quantity of horses, cows, communis,, IT catedtothehogs and farming utensils for them to make a support ; to be di slave is invitedby persons appointed by the court. If any of my negroes {-withdraw from the land, he has no right any farther to do any thing ^ e c "^ towith the land; but his share falls to the rest, until the time allowed traitor de-themon the land expires , then all my property, not disposed of,288 SLAVERY.the state after paying my debts, is to be equally divided between my brothers and sister s children." Shortly after the publication of thiswill, the testator died, and probate was bad of it in the countythe right court of Sumner. The persons appointed. executors declining to"perfect; act, Jeremiah Fisher, one of the devisees of the residuum, was P ^ ante( ^ administrator with the will annexed, and presented. to saidsent was court a petition for the emancipation of said slaves. But the -pe-madebefore or titian not containing the allegations required by law, or at least q fire d by the court, he declined proceeding any farther in thetra ^ was matter. He subsequently withdrew from the administration, filedmakes no a petition praying for an issue, and procured an issue. of-devastavitvel non to be made ; and after several trials, the issue was determinedin favor of the will, in the circuit court of Sumner, so far asrelated to the-personal property disposed of by it ; and JamesDabbs was duly appointed administrator with the will annexed.James Dabbs, it. is alleged, though urged by the negroes, and thoseinterested in their behalf, to file a petition in the county court ofSumner, for the purpose of procuring their emancipation,, refusedto dp so, upon the ground that he was unwilling to sign the bondsrequired by law. In 1829, an act was passed by the legislature ofTennessee, entitled "An act more effectually to provide for emancipationof slaves. - This act provides, " That where any personshall, by his last will and testament, have directed any slaveor slaves to be set free, it shall be the duty of the executors,or administrators with th e will annexed, to petition the countycourt, accordingly ; and if the executor or administrator shall failor refuse to do so, it shall be lawful for such slave or slaves to filea bill in equity by their next friend ; and upon its being made satisfactoryto appear to the court, that said slaver slaves ought ofright to be set free, it shall be so ordered by the court ; who shallthereupon require bond, with good security, to indemnify the countycourt under the existing laws upon that subject. And the chancellor,upon the filing of any such bill, shall make such interlocutoryorders as may be deemed necessary to secure the rightsof the respective parties." After the passage of the act of 1829,the bill of Levy, Handy, and others, by their next friend, AndrewHays, was filed. The bill states the foregoing facts, and praysthat the complainants may be emancipated and declared free, andfor an account of what they may be entitled to under the will.Jeremiah Fisher, one of the legatees of Peter Fisher, applied tothe court to be made a defendant to this bill, which motion wasOF THE EMANGtB^plON OF SLAVES. 289refused. He therefore filed an original *bill, in the nature of across bill, alleging that he had purchased from the other legateesof Peter Fisher, all their, interest under the will ; which fact wasproved. He also alleged, that the act of 1829 was unconstitutionaland void ; that the chancellor had no jurisdiction to decree or actupon the matters stated in the original bill of complainants, Leveland others. Alleged, also, that if the act were constitutional, andthe chancery court had jurisdiction, that the relief prayed oughtnot to be granted, because the slaves had not rendered such meritorious,services as would entitle them, under the laws of Tennessee,4o be .set free. That they were slaves of bad character, unworthyto be tolerated as free, and that in fact they would be a nuisanceto the neighborhood if they were free ; and that it was inconsistentwith the policy of the state to emancipate them, &c.; andcharges, that Dabbs refused to file the petition merely to give thechancery court jurisdiction.This bill, up on motion, was consolidated with the bill filed bythe slaves. Hays and Dabbs answered the* cross bill, denyingmost of the, allegations in it, to which .replications were filed.Thus stood the cause when, in 1831, the legislature passed thefollowing act, entitled " an act to explain and amend an act passedDec. T. 1829, ch. 29., more effectually to provide for theemancipation of slaves : " " Be it enacted by the general assemblyof the state of Tennessee, That the above recited act shall inno wise be so construed as to extend to any case* where any personmay, by their last will and testament, have directed any slaveor slaves to be set free before the passage of the above recited act,which this is intended to amend ; but in all .such cases where anysuit shall have been instituted in the district chancery court, underthe provisions of the act which this is intended to amend, it shallbe the duty of the chancellor, at the first term of said court afterthe passage of this act, to have the same stricken from the docket ;and it is hereby made the duty of the clerk of said court to transmitto the clerk of the county court where the parties reside, thewhole of the records and proceedings in said cause, which shallstand for trial at the first term of the county court thereafter,under the same rules, regulations, and restrictions, as if the saidsuit had been originally instituted in said county court; provided,however, that the costs which shall or may have accrued, shallabide the final issue of the suit."290 Slavery.After the passage of this act, to wit, at the terra of thechancery court at Carthage, the counsel for Fisher moved the- court to strike the cause from the docket, pursuant to its provisions.This the chancellor, Reese, refused to do, for the reasonsset forth in his opinion hereinafter referred to. The causes wereafterwards tried by Chancellor Cook, who refused to emancipateany of the slaves, except one. The bill was therefore dismissed,as to the residue. From which decree an appeal was prayed, andgranted, to this court. Upon the hearing of the cause below, itwas proposed by the complainants in the original bill, throughtheir counsel, that they were willing to accept their freedom uponany terms the court thought proper to impose. That they wouldleave the state and go to Liberia. This proposition was renewedin the supreme court. The view taken by the supreme court ofthe right of the complainants wholly supercedes the necessity ofstating the evidence in relation to the character of the slaves.Per Cur. Catron, Ch. J. Peter Fisher made his will in 1827.He had several slaves who he had devised should be free ; thatthey should have a right to reside upon his plantation for fifteenyears; have laid off to them horses, cattle, and farming utensils,to make the support with, and a year s support from the then crop,*and ten dollars in money. The balance of his property wasdevised to his brother s and sister s children as residuary legatees.The testator died, and the will was duly proved and recorded.The executors therein named did not qualify, and James Dabbswas appointed administrator with the will annexed. He refused topetition the county court tohave the slaves emancipated pursuant tothe will, because he would not involve himself by giving bond andsecurity that they would not be a county charge. Thus the matterstood, until the act of 1829, ch. 29., was passed, authorizingthe slaves to apply to the chancery court by their next friend bybill, and giving that court jurisdiction to decree emancipation.The bill was filed, and proceeded in, to a decree and appeal.In is insisted the act of 1829 is retrospective and void as againstthe distributees and residuary legatees of Peter Fisher. That theyby his death took a vested right in the slaves, and to the propertydevised to them after their emancipation, which vested right theact of 1829 gives the chancellor no power to divest ; and that thelegislature having no such power, could, of course, confer none onthe chancellor. If the premises be true, the conclusion is. HadOF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 291the legislature the power in 1829 to declare these slaves free personsby the act of assembly ] As between Peter Fisher and hisslaves, his will, on his death, was a deed of emancipation. Legislationin restraint of manumission aside, and they owed no personalservices to the representatives of Peter Fisher ; were asfree agents as themselves, and as capable of enjoying every naturalright. Being in the enjoyment of natural liberty, of course,they had a right to the enjoyment of the property devised to themby their late master. The idea that a will emancipating slaves, ordeed of manumission, is void in this state, is ill founded. It isbinding on the representatives of the devisor in the one case, andthe grantor in the other, and communicates a right to the slave ;but it is an imperfect right, until the state, the community of whichsuch emancipated person is to become a member, assents to thecontract between the master and the slave. It is adopting into thebody politic a new member, a vastly important measure in everycommunity, and especially in ours, where the majority of freemenOver twenty-one years of age, govern the balance of the people,together with themselves ; where the free negro s vote at the polls,is of as high value as that of any man. Degraded by their colorand condition in life, the free negroes are a very dangerous andmost objectionable population where slaves are numerous. Therefore,no slave can be safely freed but with the assent of the governmentwhere the manumission takes place. But this is a merematter of public policy, with which the master or the slave cannotconcern. It is an act of sovereignty, just as much as naturalizingthe foreign subject. The highest act of sovereignty agovernment can perform, is to adopt a new member, with all theprivileges and duties of citizenship. To permit an individual to dothis at pleasure, would be wholly inadmissible. Now or when thestate assents to the contract of manumission, whether before orafter its execution, is beside the contract, has nothing to do withits obligation on the master or the slave, and is unrestricted by theconstitution. Was there a general law authorizing all free personsto emancipate their slaves at pleasure, then the assent of the governmentwould be given in advance of the act of the master.Such was the law in effect and practice before the passage of theact of 1777, ch. G., to prevent domestic insurrections, and for otherpurposes. The act declared no slave should thereafter be set free,except for meritorious services, to be adjudged of and allowed bythe county court, and license first had and obtained thereupon, &c.292 SLAVERY.The county court had conferred upon it the sovereign power togive the assent of the government to the manumission, but wasrestricted in giving assent to especial cases, where the slave hadperformed some extraordinary service. This, of course, extendedto the great mass of slaves, and particularly to children, who couldnot have performed any such service. To free the mother, andretain as slaves the children, often violated humanity ; as did thegiving freedom to the husband or wife, and retaining the other inslavery. To obviate these, and such like hardships, the act of1801, ch. 27., was passed. By this act, the county court is givenas plenary power as the legislature itself possessed, to emancipateslaves on petition of the owner nine, or a majority of the justicesbeing present, and two thirds concurring. The court is to examinethe reasons set forth by the petition, and if it be of opinion, thatacceding to the same would be consistent with the interest andpolicy of the state, the chairman shall report the petition as granted?and sign the same ; which shall be filed of record. The samepower and discretion is, by the act of 1329, ch. 29., conferred onthe chancellor. It is argued, the chancellor has no discretion, hythe act of 1829, in cases coming within its provisions. We thinkit did not intend that his powers and those of the county courtshould differ, as either might be applied to, to execute the law.The chancellor was not on this branch of the proceeding beforehim, trying a cause between the slaves of the estate of Peter Fisherand his representatives, but he was acting as the authorized deputyof the state of Tennessee ; and in this capacity it lay upon him toadjudge, whether it was consistent with the interest and policy ofthe state, that the slaves who had devised to them their freedomby Peter Fisher, should be manumitted in confirmation of the will.He determined that Washington, one of the slaves should befreed, and that the others should not be. This was a sentencefrom which an appeal lay to this court. The discretion to be exercised,was a legal discretion, requiring the chancellor to adjudge.On the appeal, it is made our duty to give such judgment or sentence,as the court below ought to have given. It rests upon us todetermine what is the policy most for the interest of the communitygenerally, and of Sumner county in particular, in thismatter. That policy can best be ascertained from the act of1831, ch. 52. The state has there spoken, and might by thatact have given her assent to the bequest in Peter Fisher s will, asshe has in other similar cases, had she seen fit ; and she might infuture give her assent in this case, were this court to refuse as was inOF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 293effect done in the instance of David Beatty s slaves, as will be seenin the cause of Hope v. Johnson, 2 Yerger s Rep. 123.The policy of the act of 1831 is, not to permit a free negro tocome into the state from abroad ; and secondly, not to permit aslave freed by our laws, to be manumitted upon any other conditionthan that of being forthwith transported from the state, towhich, by the first section, he dare not return. We hold this lawto have been every way binding on the chancellor s discretion, andthat it is so in ours. We think it is clearly inconsistent with thepolicy of the state, and the interest of its citizens, to give the assentof the government to the manumission of these slaves, upon anyterms short of their immediate removal beyond, not only our jurisdiction,but beyond the limits of the United States of America-theinjustice of forcing our freed negroes on our sister states?without their consent, when we are wholly unwilling to be afflictedwith them ourselves, is so plain and direct a violation of moral duty,as to inhibit this court from taking such a step. To treat ourneighbors unjustly and cruelly, and thereby make them our enemies,is bad policy, and contrary to our interest.Would it not be treating the non-slaveholders states unjustly, toforce our freed negroes upon them without their consent ? andwould it not be treating the slave-holding states cruelly 1 We areejecting this description of population, fearing it will excite rebellionamong the slaves ; or that the slaves will be rendered immoralto a degree of depravity inconsistent with the safety and interestof the white population. These are fearful evils. But arethey not more threatening to Virginia, (just recovering from thefright of a negro rebellion,) to the Carolinas, to Georgia, Alabama,Mississippi, and Louisiana, than to us 1 Compared with the whites,most of them have two slaves to our one ; some of them almostten to our one. Even Kentucky has a higher proportion thanTennessee. How can we then, as honest men, thrust ourfreed negroes on our neighbors of the South ? Suppose thenon-slaveholJing states north west of the Ohio were willing toreceive our freed negroes, (a supposition by the way whollyuntrue,) would it be good policy in us to locate them on ourborders, beside our great rivers, forming wretched free negrocolonies, in constant intercourse with our slaves] They mustlive in neighborhood separated from the whites. Their conditionhas, and will preclude intermarriages and close association. Thatsuch a population inhabiting a country near us, would become amost dangerous receptacle to our runaway slaves, and a grievous294 SLAVERY.affliction to the state where situated, as well as to ourselves, needonly be stated to gain universal admission. The time would soon- come when the attempt to seize on the harbored slaves would producewar with such a people, and serious collisions with the statewithin whose jurisdiction they resided. This it is our own interestto avoid. All the slaveholders states, it is believed, as well asmany of the non-slaveholders, like ourselves, have adopted the policyof exclusion. The consequence is, the freed negro cannotfind a home that promises even safety, in the United States, andassuredly none that promises comfort. We order the present petitionersfor freedom to be emancipated on the terms, that they besent beyond the limits of the United States, for additional reasons.The act of 1833, ch. 64., to aid the colonization society, provides,that the treasurer of Middle Tennessee pay to the treasurer of thesociety for its use, ten dollars for each free black person that thetreasurer of the society shall certify has been removed from thestate of Tennessee to the coast of Africa.The foregoing society has formed a colony of free blacks atLiberia, on the coast of Africa. The people residing there are allfrom the United States, speak our language, pursue our habits,profess the Christian religion, are sober, industrious, moral, andcontented ; are enjoying a life of comfort and of equality, which it isimpossible in this country to enjoy, where the black man is degradedby his color, and sinks into vice and worthlessness, from thewant of motive to virtuous and elevated conduct.The black man in these states may have the power of volition.He may go and come when it pleaseth him, without a domesticmaster to control the actions of his person ; but to be politicallyfree, to be the peer and equal of the white man, to enjoy theoffices, trusts, and privileges our institutions confer on the whiteman, is hopeless now and forever. The slave, who receives theprotection and care of a tolerable master, holds a condition heresuperior to the negro who is freed from domestic slavery. He isa reproach and a by-word with the slave himself, who taunts hisfellow slave by telling him, " he is as worthless as a free negro !"The consequence is inevitable. The free black man lives amongstus without motive and without hope. He seeks no avocation, issurrounded with necessities, is sunk in degradation. crime cansink him no deeper, and he commits it of course. This is notonly true of the free negro residing in the slaveholders states ofthis union : in the non-slaveholders states the people are less aoOF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 295customer to the squalid and disgusting wretchedness of the negro;have less sympathy for him, earn their means of subsistence withtheir own hands, and are more economical in parting with them,than him for whom the slave labors, of which he is entitled to sharethe proceeds, and of which the free negro is generally the participant,and but too often in the character of the receiver of stolengoods. Nothing can be more untrue than that the free negro ismore respectable as a member of society in the non-slaveholders,than the slaveholders states. In each, he is a degraded outcast,and his fancied freedom a delusion. With us, the slave ranks himin character and comfort ; nor is there a fair motive to absolve himfrom the duties incident to domestic slavery, if he is to continueamongst us. Generally, and almost universally, society suffers;and the negro suffers by manumission.These are some of the reasons why we give the assent of the stateto the emancipation of these slaves, in accordance to Peter Fishers will, upon the condition, and condition only, that they be transportedto the coast of Africa. To the course pursued in this instance,there might be exceptions in other cases ; but they shouldbe most rare, and grounded on reasons the most prominent andconclusive. This application furnishes none such. Bond and securitywill be given, partly in accordance with the second sectionof the act of 1831, ch. 102., conditioned, that the freed personsshall be transported to the colony of Liberia, on the coast of Africa,and which shall form part of the judgment of this court. Theact of 1831, ch. 101., in effect directed the chancery court to dismissthis cause. Chancellor Reese, in a very lucid opinion, treatedthe act, and justly, as an unauthorized mandate, unconstitutionaland void. This court adopts that opinion, which is herewith filed.Decree affirmed.The following is the opinion of Chancellor Reese, referred to andadopted in the foregoing opinion.The act of 1829, ch. 29., contains two important features : First,it declares it to be the duty of the executor, when there is a bequestof liberty to a slave, to endeavor to procure his emancipation.This had before that time been ruled to be his duty by the supremecourt of the state, in the cases of M Cutchen v. Price and Wife,3 Hay wood s Rep. 211., and Ann Hope v. Johnson, 2 Yerger sRep. 123. And, in the second place, that if the executor fail toperform this duty, the slave, by his next friend, may file his bill,and have his rights or claim to liberty under the will inquired into296 SLAVERY.and determined. These decisions, and this act of assembly prove,that the rigor of former opinions on the subject of slavery had,whether properly or otherwise, not a little relented. The act recognizesthe bequest of freedom as a valuable right to the slavehimself, to be prosecuted by him, under some circumstances, inthe courts of the country. After the passage of this act of assembly,the slaves in question, by Andrew Hays, Esq. of Davidson,filed their bill in this court, the administration with the willannexed, continued to refuse any application on his part in theirbehalf to the county court of Sumner ; and in their bill they makeJames Dabbs, the said administrator, a party defendant, and allegethe material facts herein before stated ; pray, that the may beemancipated ; and also pray, that an account may be taken ofthe personal property bequeathed to them by the will, and of theirhire since the death of the testator.Dabbs filed his answer ; admits his refusal to petition the countycourt of Sumner on behalf of complainants ; expresses his willingness,and even anxiety, that the will of the testator on the mattershould be carried into effect, and exhibits an account of thehire of the negroes. Jeremiah Fisher, who claims to have purchasedthe interest of the other devisees of Peter Fisher, thereuponfiled his cross bill, making Hays and Dabbs party defendants, andalleging collusion between them ; and charging, that the refusalof Dabbs to apply to the county court of Sumner, on behalf of thecomplainants was with a view to give this court jurisdiction ; andalso praying an account against Dabbs as administrator. Haysand Dabbs severally answer, and deny the above allegations.On the application of Fisher at the July term of this court, thiscross bill was consolidated with the other case. By a previousorder of this court, pursuant to the provisions of the act of 1829,ch. 29., the complainants were put into the custody of the clerkand master of this court ; an account was ordered between theparties, and a report made, which has been confirmed. Replicationswere filled, and the cause in a state forbearing at the presentterm of this court.Under these circumstances, the following act of assembly, passedNovember 28th, 1831, is produced to the court, entitled, "Anact to explain and amend an act passed Dec. 7th, 1829, ch. 29.,more effectually to provide for the emancipation of slaves." Thisact provides tjiat " the above recited act shall in no wise be aoOF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 297construed as to extend to any case where any person may, by theirlast will and testament, have directed any slave or slaves to be setfree, before the passage of the above-recited act, which this is intendedto amend ; but in all such cases, where any suit shall havebeen instituted in the district chancery court, under the provisionsof the act which this is intended to amend, it shall be the duty ofthe chancellor, at the first term of the court after the passage ofthis act, to have the same stricken from the docket ; and it is herebymade the duty of the clerk of said court, to transmit to the clerkof the county court where the parties reside, the whole of the recordand proceedings in said cause, which shall stand for trial atthe first term of the county court thereafter, under the same rulesregulations, and restrictions, as if the said suit had been originallyinstituted in said county court : provided, however, that the costswhich shall or may have accrued, shall abide the final issue of thesuit."Upon this act of assembly, the court has been moved by the solicitorof Fisher, that this cause, pursuant to its mandates, bestrike from the docket. And the question is, shall this be done ?Is the respect and deference for the legislative will, when distinctlyexpressed, which is justly due from this court, and fully acknowledgedby it, to be countervailed, in the present instance, bythat paramount obligation which is exacted by the fundamentallaw 1 It is a proposition not to be controverted, that not courtesyonly, but duty requires of courts of justice, in expounding legislatelive enactments, with reference to their conformity to the constitution,to give them such examination as will reconcile them together,and not bring them into conflict, and to be clearly satisfiedthat a law is unconstitutional, before they so pronounce it. Thereis this difference, it occurs to me, between the situation of a legislatorand a judge : the former should yield his support to nomeasure unless fully convinced of its conformity to the constitution; the latter should give effect to all the statute laws of thestate, when he no more than doubts the legislative competency tohave passed them. But the duty of a judge is obvious and acknowledged,to pronounce an act of the legislature unconstitutionalwhen he believes it to be so ; and it is the peculiar province ofthe judicial department to expound laws and pronounce upon theirconformity with the constitutional will of the people. The questionrecurs, shall the court strike the cause in question from the298 SLAVERY.docket ? The legislature has said it shall, and at the present term,I entertain no doubt that the act in question was passed with thepurest motives, and upon the fullest conviction, perhaps, of its proprietyand justice. It is pretty evident, however, that the legislaturewas not only uninformed, but probably misinformed of thesituation and matter of this case ; of this bill and cross bill, and ofthe relation in which the parties stand to each other, and the previouslyexisting laws ; for the clerk of this court is ordered totransmit the whole record and proceedings in the cause to thecountry court, and the county court are ordered to try the causeso transmitted, under the same rules, regulations, and restrictions,which would have governed them if the cause had been institutedthere. The only cause which could have been instituted there bylaw,would have been a petition by Dabbs, administrator, as plaintiff,in behalf of the complainant s freedom.But this petition Dabbs has not filed, and would not file ; andbecause of his refusal, he is a defendant to this bill. But I waivethis consideration, as, also, the further consideration, that in strikingthis cause from the docket, I should strike off matter properlycognizable in this court, without reference to the act of 1829, andmeet the question fairly upon the main point. The act of 1831contains three propositions worthy of consideration. That the actof 1829, ch. 29., ought, in no wise, to be so construed as to extendto cases where a will directed slaves to be set free before the passageof the act ; that, therefore, the court should strike such causesfrom the docket, and that the clerk transmit the record to thecounty court. If the first proposition were correct, that is, thatthe proper construction of the act of 1829, does not confer uponthis court jurisdiction over a cause circumstanced like the present ?the substance of the legislative mandate would follow, and thecause would, if not literally stricken from the docket, be dismissed ;indeed, if such has been the opinion of my predecessor and theother chancellor, the orders which have been made in the causewould not have existed.It is for the legislature to pass the law, and for the court to expoundit. They did pass the law of 1829, and the court here presentis of opinion, that a proper construction of that act, as appliedto the facts of this case, gives to the court cognizance of the cause.They took cognizance accordingly, and now we are informed bythe act of 1831, that the former act ought to be so construed, andOF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 299should be construed as in no wise to apply to a case like this. Ineed not argue to show how little authoritative a conclusion, alegislative exposition of a former act, should be considered. Thecounsel for the motion are understood to concede that legislativeexpositions are not to be relied on, and that the exposition in questionis not well founded. Here, then, is a case where a rightdeemed valuable, and a proper subject for litigation, the right tofreedom under a will is brought into this court in pursuance of thelaw, and the matter proper for the investigation of this court ispending. The facts and circumstances which fix the rights of theparties, and give the jurisdiction of the court, are past, or alreadyexist, when a simple legislative mandate comes to us and says, sucha case shall not be tried shall be stricken from the docket. Thisis the whole of the matter ; for if the legislative exposition of theact of 1829 goes for nothing, there is nothing left but the simple,naked, direct mandate of the legislature to strike the cause fromthe docket ; for the balance of the law is a mere direction to theclerk. Shall this court can this court obey the mandate 1 If itmay in this cause, it may in any it may in all. Shall the rightsof all the parties in this cause to that relief, and to that remedy,by due course of law, which their case calls for, be disregarded,and this court be closed against them 1 For the efficacy of theact of 1831, and the duty of this court with regard to it, cannotdepend upon the fact that a motion has been made to give it effect.If that motion could succeed, the duty of the court would havebeen the same if all the parties had been not only willing, butanxious to proceed in this court. The declaration of rights, sec.17., provides, that all courts shall be open, and " every man, foran injury done him in his lands, goods, fame, or reputation, shallhave remedy by due course of law, and right and justice administeredwithout sale, denial, or delay." This declaration, copiedfrom the great charter, is not a collection of unmeaning epithets,In England, the reason of riveting this barrier around the rightsof the subject, was well understood. Their sovereign was wontto interfere in the administration of justice ; " a remedy by duecourse of law " was often refused under the mandate of men inpower, and the injured man denied justice ; they were orderedsometimes not to proceed with particular causes, and justice wasdelayed ; and the obtainment of their rights was often burdenedwith improper conditions and sacrifices, and justice was sold. Soanxious were they to stop this enormous evil, that a part of the300 SLAVERY.official oath of a judge was, that he would proceed to do right andjustice, notwithstanding any letter or order to him to the contrary.This clause of magna charta why is it inserted in our bill ofrights 1 Was it from apprehensions of our executive 1 We hadleft him no power. Whatever power is considered as properlybelonging to the executive department elsewhere, is by our institutions,conferred upon the legislature. It is the more important,therefore, and so the framers of our constitution decreed, that thejudicial department should be independent and co-ordinate, andthat the legislature should have no judicial power. Danger mightjustly be apprehended from this quarter. " The judicial power(the whole of it) shall be vested in such superior and inferiorcourts of law and equity," c. If the legislature, possessing alarge share of executive power, be permitted to exercise judicialpower also, or control the action of the judges within their peculiarsphere, the liberty of the citizens, under the government ofgood legislators, would be in imminent peril, and under bad oneswould be entirely destroyed. The duties and powers growing outof the relation between the legislature and the judicial department,and the lines of demarcation between them, have been the subjectof earnest and elaborate discussion in the courts of the severalstates, and particularly those of the United States ; and in the casesof Dartmouth College, of Fletcher and Peck, and of Green andBiddle, and of many others which need not be referred to, theprinciples applicable to questions of this sort are well settled, andthe only difficulty is to apply them to the facts of particular cases.A distinction between the right and the remedy is made, and exists.But where the remedy has attached itself to the right, andis being prosecuted by " due course of law," to separate betweenthem, and take away the remedy, is to do violence to the right,and within the reason of that provision of our constitution whichprohibits retrospective, or, in other words, retroactive laws frombeing passed, or laws impairing the obligation of contracts.By the act of 1829, all slaves in whose favor there is a devise ofliberty, and where the representative of the testator refuses to applyto the county court, they may file a bill by their next friend inthis court ; the act of 1831 attempts to take away this right froma portion of them, and from that portion of them where the rightand remedy had attached by the actual pendency of a suit, in a"due course of law." Is not this partial and unequal legislation ?It is believed it is. It would give me much more pleasure, if dutyOF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 301would permit, to conform to the will of the legislature. This feelingis inspired not only by respect and courtesy, but, perhaps also,by a lively sense of the feeble and unsustained character of judicialpower, which rests only upon the moral feelings upon thereason of the community. An improper yielding to legislativeenactments, is a danger more to be apprehended from the judicialdepartment, than rash or uncalled for opposition. The history ofevery age and of every country, has, in every page of it, shownthis to be the case.The independence of the judiciary ought to be anxiously preservedunimpaired ; not on account of the individuals who mayhappen to be judges ; they are nothing ; but on account of thesecurity of life, liberty, and property, to the citizen. I feel satisfied,that I have no sympathies which would have misled me in thismatter ; for when permitted to indulge my feelings and opinionsas an individual, I find them in strong and direct hostility to allschemes for emancipating slaves under existing circumstances, inthe bosom of our community.Let the complainant in the cross bill take nothing by his motion.After the above opinion was pronounced the counsel for Fishermoved the court to set aside the decree, and to re-hear the cause,and set forth his reasons in a petition to re-hear.Catron, Ch. J. The motion to set aside the decree in the caseof Fisher s negroes, was brought before the court on yesterday,the last business day of the term. My mind was too depressedwith recent over-exertion, to take that strong view of the subject,its intricacy and importance demanded ; and I now feel myselfwanting in vigor. However, there is no time left. The acts of1829, ch. 29., and 1831, ch. 101., received little consideration bythis court when the opinion on the merits of the cause was drawnup. The court was satisfied with, and adopted the opinion of thechancellor. Upon the high intelligence and ability of that gentleman,we felt safe in resting. Our own opinion is, however, nowanxiously desired, on the construction of the act of 1831, and theparty dissatisfied is entitled to it.By the common law, the owner of a slave might manumit himat pleasure. The acts of 1777 and 1801 prohibited this, unlessthe government assented to the contract of manumission. Togive this assent, the county courts were vested with authority. Adeed or will of manumission is not void, but binds the owner orrepresentative of the testator, as between him and the slave ; it302 SLAVERY.confers a moral right to freedom upon the slave. Before the actof 1829, the master, or his representative, the executor, was to dothe first act: petition the court for the government s assent. Theslave had no power \o cause his right to be enforced by the courtsof justice. He had to deal with sovereignty ; he could not suethe state, and compel her to execute the contract with his master.It lay with her to direct the manner in which the remedy shouldbe enforced. Bill of Rights, sec. 17. This is a prerogative ofsovereignty, and is independent of the constitution. Then camethe act of 1829, for more effectually emancipating slaves. It provides,that where any person shall, by his last will, have directedany slave to be set free, it shall be the duty of the executor to petitionthe county court, as by the previous laws prescribed. And ifthe executor should fail, or refuse, it should be lawful for such slaveto file his bill in equity by his next friend ; and upon its being madeto appear to the court, that said slave ought to be free, the chancellorshould so order ; and hti is given jurisdiction to make allnecessary interlocutory orders to secure the rights of the respectiveparties.Under this act, Fisher s negroes filed their bill ; brought beforethe court the proper parties ; were placed in the hands of a receiver,and the cause ready for hearing. Then was passed the actof 1831, ch. 101., professing to explain the act of 1829. It declaresthe act shall, in no wise, be construed to extend to any case wherethe will was made before its passage. To all subsequent cases,the act of 1829 still applies, and is in full force. In other words,the act of 1831 attempts a repeal of the jurisdiction of the chancellorin the case of Fisher s negroes ; and orders the chancellorat the next term to dismiss the cause. It next directs the clerk ofthe chancery court, to transmit to the clerk of the county court,the whole of the records and proceedings in said cause, which shallstand for trial at the first term of the county court. The act declaresthat of 1829 did not embrace such a case as that of Fisher snegroes ; that the chancery court had no jurisdiction of it ; and isin effect a positive mandate sent to the chancellor, in the form ofan act of assembly, "to.strike the cause from the docket of hiscourt," because, by the act of 1829 he had no jurisdiction, and hadmisconstrued the law. The chancellor had made interlocutoryorders in the cause ; he consolidated it with two others, betweenthe administrator with Peter Fishers s will annexed, and the principlelegatee of the estate. Nothing but a final decree was want.OF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 303ing to end the controversy, and settle the account of the estate,so intimately blended with the emancipation of the slaves, who werealso legatees, that it was impossible finally to decree, until this wasdone or refused. The previous orders mac* in the causes, thelegislature, by the act of 1831, attempted to reverse, and ordereddirectly the principal bill to be dismissed.By the act of 1829, the chancery court had undoubted jurisdictionof the cause. By article fifth of the constitution, the judicialpower is to be vested in such courts of law and equity as the legislaturemay establish. It is an independent power, and where it hasjurisdiction, a sovereign power, just as much as the legislatureitself. He, who has a lawful right, and a legal remedy to enforcethat, and the jurisdiction of a court has attached upon it, is entitledto judgment. The legislature has no power to close the courts.The courts shall be open, and every man shall have remedy bydue course of law. That is, every man having a legal right, andan open remedy. Art. 11, sec. 17, The legislature may confera right, and give a remedy to a slave. Having opened the courtsto him, he is entitled, independent of his color or his civil condition,to have justice administered in the due course of law, without denialor delay. Peter Fisher s negroes, by his will, took a right, acommon law right, one binding on the executor, as a trustee ; buttheir remedy rested with him ; he might petition the county court,or not, at his pleasure. If he did, the distributees of Peter Fishercould not complain. The case of David s negroes, 2 Yerger s Rep.563. The act of 1829 gave a remedy to the slaves ; not as againstPeter Fisher s representative, against him as trustee ; the previouslaw would have offered a remedy in equity ; but the state as a thirdparty had to assent to the manumission.The state could not be sued until a remedy was provided. Theact of 1829 provided that remedy, in pursuance of article 11. sec,17., of our constitution. The imperfect right to emancipationconferred by Peter Fisher s will, wanted nothing but the assent ofthe state to perfect it ; and jurisdiction was given to the chancelloracting in his judicial capacity, according to judicial forms, at hisdiscretion, to manumit the complainants, if he thought it consistentwith the policy of the state. Though one of the widest knowndiscretions, yet it was a legal discretion, and one he dare not refuseto exercise, either for or against the complainants. On this groundwe exercise jurisdiction on this branch of the cause on appealHad the discretion been unrestricted, no appeal would have lain.304 SLAVERY.The legislature had no power to dismiss the bill, and to close thechancery courts against the complainants. This is not denied hythe argument of the opposite counsel ; but it is urged, that a changeof jurisdiction, from the chancery court to the Sumner countycourt, was within the power of the legislature. That the legislaturehad the power to withdraw the cause from the chancery court,and order that court to send it to the Sumner county court forhearing, I think is clearly true, if the county court either hadtheretofore jurisdiction to hear the cause, or if the legislature thenconferred the jurisdiction. But the county court had no chanceryjurisdiction by any previous law to that of 1831, and no power tofinally hear the cause, in the form it would have been presented,Having no cognizance of the subject matter, the act of 1831 wasa naked mandate to the chancellor to turn the complainants out ofthis court, and there leave them, unless the act conferred jurisdictionof the cause, as a chancery cause, on the county court. Didit do so ? The act tells us the cause shall stand for hearing in thecounty court at the first term, under the same rules, regulations,and restrictions, as if the said suit had been originally instituted insaid county court. The court was to try the cause, not accordingto the rules and restrictions of the chancery court, but accordingto its own rules, long in force by the acts of 1777 and 1801, forthe emancipation of slaves. That is, by petition, not by the slave,(he could not come into the county court, or sue there,) but themaster, or his executor, setting forth the motives for the manumission; which, if approved, the court shall grant the petition, andrecord the evidence of the emancipation. Had the cause gone tothe county court, the complainants had no right to take a singlestep as actors. The court had no right to take a single depositionon their behalf, or make any order or decree against James Dabbsor J. Fisher, or even to compel Baker, the receiver of the courtof chancery, who had the complainants in possession, to deliverthem to a receiver of the county court.An attempt to decree the legacy left the negroes to order anaccount for their hire, amounting to eight hundred dollars, wouldhave been wholly beyond any powers of that court. None suchare claimed for it. I therefore think, as my three brother judgeshave all along thought, that the act of 1831 was a naked mandateto the chancellor to dismiss the bill ; that the act was retrospectiveof the rights of the complainants, and is void ; and that the chancellordid not err in hearing the cause.OF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 3058.Voltaic et al v.

That f r e * sit is a presumption which the law raises from the parent callingthe slave his child in a public instrument ; and nothing in the provisionsof the Roman law prevented the father or mother holdingthe child in slavery, when either qualified the acknowledgmentin the authentic act. The laws of Spain in relation to father andson did not prevent their holding each other as slaves ; and wethink, that as they were permitted to hold either as a slave, theymight hold him as a statu liber, and make him such.In some of the states a special legislative grant is requisite to a valid emancipation.This appears to be the case in Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama, and Mississippi.See James Dig. 398. act of 1820. ; Prince s Dig. 456; act of 1801; Toulman s Dig. 632. ; Mississippi Rev. Code 386. In North Carolina the right to emancipationis made to depend upon meritorious services done by the slave, and whichare to be adjudged of and allowed by the county court.

They pleadedthe general issue. There was judgment for them, and she appealed.The defendant s ancestor, in the deed of emancipation producedby the plaintiff, says, " I hold, as my slave, a Creole negrogirl named Catin, aged 18 years, born in my service from the negrowoman Martha, to whom I gave her freedom according to theterms of the deed, which I executed before the present notary, lastyear, 1801, and I have offered to the said Catin her freedom, oncertain conditions (terminus) which I shall express, gratuitouslyand without interest, in consideration of the good services of hermother, the said Martha. In consideration whereof, 1 grant bythese presents, that I emancipate and liberate from all subjection,captivity, and servitude, the said negro Catin, my slave, with thequalification and condition, (caliban y condition) that she shall holdand enjoy freedom, (fewer, disfrutar y gozar,) immediately after mydeath. But during my life she is to remain in my service and power,continuing and contributing her services, as she has done to the dateof these presents.

Mathews, J. The decision of this case depends entirelyon the construction to be given to the act of emancipation,by which the appellant claims to have been made free, at the timeof the birth of the children, for whom she now claims freedom.We are of opinion, that the court below has given a just interpretationto said act, and was correct in considering the mother to havebeen of that class of persons, known to the Roman law, by the appellationof statu liberi, and that children born from her, while insuch a state, are not entitled to freedom.

And the certificate was signed by the overseers, butnot by the executors of Hopkins, to whom the slave belonged, andt he certificate was duly recorded.The court held, that this certificate, registered at the request ofthe executors of Hopkins, was conclusive evidence to charge thetown with the future maintenance of the slave, and in the opinionof the court, manumitted the slave.11.BAZZI v. ROSE and her child. May T. 1820. 8 Martin s LouisianaRep. 149.Per Cur. Martin, J. The petition states, that these defendantsare the plaintiff s slaves, and obtained a writ of habeas corpusfrom the president of the criminal court, on which they were dis if an j n f or .charged ; that the proceedings therein are erroneous in law and in ^ al a ^ n ~fact. The answer avers the freedom of the defendants, and there takes placeis a plea of presumption. There was judgment for the defendants, promisingand the plaintiff appealed. %mZ\There comes up with the record, a number of depositions, and gal formalities,hisseveral bills of exceptions, no part of which it appears necessary rights areto examine. The defendants claim their freedom, under a deed affected? yof emancipation from the plaintiff. Libere. vel non, is the only issuewhich can exist between the parties. If they be slaves, they be observecontest the plaintiff s title to them. They have no capacityto stand in judgment for any other purpose than to establish ordefend their claim to freedom. Trudeau s ex r v. Robinette, 4 Martins Rep. 580. The act of emancipation introduced by the defendants,is dated St. Ago de Cuba, May 24th, 1805, and purports,that the plaintiff " desirous of acknowledging the signal servicesof Gertrude, a Congo negro woman, aged 44 years, on severaloccasions, gives freedom to her and her child Rose, aged 10|years, to be fully enjoyed without any trouble ; promising, in duetime and place, to comply with the formalities which the law requires."SLAVERY.The parish court " considering that the plaintiff, by sending theact of freedom, which he had directed to be passed in the islandof Cuba, in behalf of the defendants, in order that it might be depositedhere with a notary public, to make it valid, as well by hislong silence thereon afterwards, as by his subsequent conduct withregard to the defendant Rose, and her free baptized children, untillately, when he thought he had good reason to complain of her,had thereby completed and confirmed his act of freedom (which,in the opinion of the parish court, on the circumstances of thiscause, the favorable application of the law must protect,) gavejudgment for the defendants. In the correct decision of this case,it is all important to decide, whether the defendant, Rose, acquiredher freedom in St. Ago de Cuba by the execution of the deed whichthe plaintiff has caused to be recorded here. It is not pretendedthat she had any claim to freedom when she left the island ofCuba, exclusively of the contents of this deed. For, if she arrivedhere a slave, she must still be considered as such, unless she hasbeen emancipated according to the laws of this state, and this isneither alleged nor proven. The Parthia 4. 22. 1., requires, thatwhere emancipation takes place in writing, it be done before fivewitnesses.

Grcgorio Lopez, in his commentaryon this law, says, this solemnity has been held unnecessary; but the writer does not quote or allege any law in support ofthe assertion ; and Lopez concludes that it is : non allcgat hemquae suum dictum probe, unde servanda est ista lex quae vult hoc essenecessarium. The grantor, in executing this deed, knew his rightwas not thereby destroyed, since he promised to fulfil the formalities,the sine qua non which the law required.It therefore results, that the execution of this writing, or deed,did not render the defendant free. Nothing shows that any thingdid happen in Cuba by which the defect of the deed was cured.If these defendants were slaves on their leaving Cuba, they wereso at their landing in this state. Here the law requires certainformalities for the acquisition of freedom, none of which are pretendedto have been fulfilled. Is the record of the deed, in theoffice of a notary, an act under which the defendants may claimtheir freedom ? We think not. It is contended, that the admissionof the plaintiff, that he executed the deed, makes full proof againsthim, and that the Spanish law requires the presence of witnesses toprotect the grantor against the perjury of a single witness. TheOF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 309laws of most countries require formalities or ceremonies to attendthe execution of certain contracts ; and although these formalitiesand ceremonies generally, perhaps universally, tend to secure astronger evidence of the contract, this is not perhaps the only object.In the case of an emancipation relate sus amigos, in the presenceof friends and before five witnesses, without writing, spoken of inthe parthia cited, the required presence of five witnesses might notalways protect against the perjury of a single witness. For theemancipation would be proven, if he deposed it took place beforehim and four witnesses, dead since. The presence of a magistrate,the attendance of an unusual number of witnesses, the affixing ofa seal, are all circumstances which, besides securing more evidence,are attended with this particular advantage : they make a strongimpression on the mind of the party, excite reflection in him uponthe subject he is engaged in ; they ordinarily require time, and,consequently, afford an interval for thought ad awake apprehension,and are no contemptible guards against circumvention, fraud,and surprise. 1 Hay wood s Rep. 203. Farther, the deed itself shows,that the grantor did not intend to destroy, ipso facto, his right onthe defendant, Rose ; he knew what he then did had no sucheffect ; for he agreed, at a future time, to comply with the formalitieswhich the law required. What he did must then be considered,notwithstanding the words in the first part of the deed, as a manifestationof his intention to free the defendant Rose, and her child,at a future day. His subsequent conduct, till the record of thedeed in the notary s office, shows that such was his apprehension.Is the case altered by this record ? We think not. If the plaintiffheld legally the defendants as his slaves when they landed inLouisiana, they must have remained so, unless emancipated accordingto our laws ; and this is not pretended to have been done. Itis, therefore, ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that the judgment ofthe parish court be annulled, avoided, and reversed, and that thedefendant Rose, and her child, be decreed to be the slaves of theplaintiff,12.In the case of NEGRO TOM.

T. 1817. 14 John s Rep. 188.Emancipate an action of assumpsit for supporting the defendant s slave,presumed, he gave in evidence the will of his father-in-law, by which he bequeathedthe plaintiff to his three children. The plaintiff, then, toprove his freedom a writing sealed by the children of the testator,by which they manumitted him, on condition that he served themthree years, which service was performed. The court below ruled,that a manumission by two of the joint owners of the plaintiff,amounted to a destruction of the entire interest, and gave him hisfreedom, especially where the third joint owner has for along timesuffered him to act as a freeman, without a claim.Per Cur. Spencer, J. The manumission of the plaintiff by twoor three joint owners would, of itself, make him a freeman.* Noperson can be partly a slave, and partly free, or a slave for onethird of the time, and free for two thirds ; he must be one or theother entirely. The manumission by two may be considered a destructionof the tenancy in common, and a conversion of the slave,as it regards the proprietor of one third. And suffering the plain-withrespect to emancipation, it may be stated as a principle without an exception,that, as slaves are considered as property upon which creditors have a right to lookfor the payment of their debts due by the owners of slaves, regard must be had to therights of the creditor ; and no emancipation is valid when those rights are violated.By the Rev. Code of Virginia, p. 434., any emancipated slave may be taken executionfor a debt contracted by the person emancipating the slave, if the indebtednessexisted before the act of emancipation. And in the acts of some of the states, an expressprovision is to be found guarding the right of emancipation, and saving the rightsof creditors. 2 Litter Swi. 1155. 27.; Act of 1798.; Mississippi Rev. Code, 386.;Civil Code of Louisiana, art. 190. And this protecting law in favor of creditors is extendedto widows, entitled to one third of their husband s personal estate. 1 VirginiaRev.

All presumptionsin favor of personal liberty ought to be made.14.HAMILTON v. CRAGG. June T. 1823. 6 Har. & Johns. Rep. 16. ;HALL v. MULLIN, 5 Har. & Johns. Rep. 190.Under the statute of 1796, ch. 67. 13., the court held, that an An infantinfant unable to gain sufficient maintenance and livelihood, cannotbe manumitted; nor can a slave be set free who is not both ted -under the age of 45 years, and able to work and gain a sufficientmaintenance and livelihood at the time the freedom is intended tocommence.15.MOSES v. Degree. Nov. T. 1828. 6 Rand s Rep. 561,The Court, Carr, J., held, in this case that a deed of emancipationof the slave executed in 1781, declaring the slave free when heshould arrive at full age, which would be in 1 796, is void by theact of 1723, by which emancipation is prohibited except for meritoriousservices, and by permission of the governor and council ;that the case of Pleasants v. Pleasants, 2 Call s Rep. 319., carriedthe law far enough, although it violated no statute. The willmerely directed, that his slaves should have their freedom wheneverthe laws would permit it, and created a trust to support thedevise. And the court said, that emancipation by deed or will,made before May, 1782, of a slave, even where freedom is to takeeffect at a future time, is unlawful and void.(B) BY WILL.1.MARY v. MORRIS, et al. Aug. T. 1834. 7 Louisiana Rep. 135.The plaintiff claimed freedom under the will of one Marshall, twho held her in slavery in the state of Georgia. The testator contrived"died, and the slave was taken by the testator s daughter to Louis tionofthediana, and there sold by the executors of her husband after his state isdecease. void312 SLAVERY.The defendant pleaded, that the will of Marshall devising freedomto his slaves was void ; that by the laws of Georgia a slavecould only be set free by a legislative act.The district judge thought, that slaves, being passive in theirsituation and character, it was the duty of the executor to see thewill executed, which he viewed in the light of a contract. Judgmentfor plaintiff. Appeal.But the court reversed the judgment, and held, that the bequestin the will being prohibited by the laws of Georgia, whereit was made, is null and void; that the bequest of liberty toslaves, which is made in contravention of the law of a state enactedfor the security of the public peace and good order of the community,is absolutely null and void, and such slaves do not, ipsofacto, become free under the will, or being brought into this statewhere slavery is tolerated, but in which slaves may be manumittedby will. And see Pleasants v.

Chasten v. FORD. Spring T. 1824. 5 Little s Rep. 268.Trespass, by Ford, a man of color, against Chasteen, to recoverhis freedom.It appeared, that Lewis Chasteen made his will, and devised,that all his slaves should be set free on their arriving at 25 yearsof age. The children of the testator exhibited a bill in equityagainst the executors, alleging the invalidity of the will, and prayinga decision of the court thereon. The court pronouncedagainst the validity of the will. Ford arrived at the age specifiedin the will after the court had pronounced against its validity.And the question on these facts is, whether Ford was entitled to hisfreedom or not.Per Cur. Owslcy, J. Ford claims his freedom under the will ;and was the question of his right governed exclusively by the importof the will, we should have no difficulty in pronouncing Ford a freeman.He had arrived at the age of 25 years, the commencementof this action, and the will expressly declares he should be emancipatedat that age.But the will has been declared to be inoperative, by the decreeOF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 313of a court of equity, and that decree was, in argument, contendedto be conclusive i n the present case. But Ford was no party tothat suit ; and it was insisted in argument, that as to him the decreecan have no operation in this contest. It must not be forgotten,that at the time the decree was pronounced, Ford had notarrived at the age to which, by the will, he had to arrive beforehe was entitled to his freedom. He could not, therefore, have beenmade a party, and the failure to have made him a party, cannot bealleged to render the decree inoperative as to him.CHEW v. GARY. June T. 1825. 6 Har. & Johns.

In all the cases we have hadbefore us on this question, the certificate of the master has eitherbeen delivered to the slave, or to some third person for his benefit,and the act has thereby become consummated. But in the casebefore us, it must be considered as resting only in intention. Noact has been done that is binding on the master. We are of opinion,therefore, that the girl is not entitled to her freedom.5.PLEASANTS v. PLEASANTS. 2 Call s Rep. 319. 357.The testator, by his will in 1771, directed, that "all his slavesshould be free, when they arrived at the age of 30 years, and the lawsof the land would permit them to be free without being transportedout of the country ; that is, all his slaves now born, or hereaftershall be born, whilst their mothers were in the service of him orhis heirs, to be free at the age of 30 years, as above mentioned,their age to be adjudged of by his trustees." He then gave his sonRobert eight negroes, " on condition he allowed them to be freeat the age of 30 years, if the laws of the land would admit of it ;"and then devised the residue of the slaves to sundry persons undersimilar conditions.Held by the court, that the limitations were good in the event ofsuch a law being passed, while the slaves remained in the possessionof the family, without change by the intervention of creditorsor purchasers ; it being considered too rigid to apply the rule respectingthe limitation of the remainder of a chattel upon too remotea contingency, with all its consequences, to the present case ;but that a reasonable principle ought to be adopted to suit its peculiarcircumstances. And, therefore, after the passage of the act of1782, permitting the emancipation on certain conditions imposed toprevent persons emancipated from becoming burdensome to thecommunity, the court being of opinion that the limited manumission,according to the modifications in the will could alone takeplace, and that the terms for securing the public against the maintenanceof the aged and infirm, could not be equitably imposedupon the devisees, it was decreed that all the slaves (not subject tothe claims of creditors or purchasers) who at the date of the decreewere above the age of 45, and their increase born after their respectivemothers had attained the age of 30 years, should beemancipated so soon as the executor of the several trustees, or anyOF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 315other person, should, in the courts of the several counties in whichthe slave respectively resided, enter into bonds with approved sureties,payable to the justices then sitting in each court, and their successors,with condition, that the said slaves should not becomechargeable to the public, or should enter into one such bond forthe whole in the general court ; that all who, at the same datewere above 30 years, and under 45, should be immediately emancipatedand set free to all intents and purposes, as if born free ; andthat all who at the same date were under the age of 30, and whosemothers had not attained that age at their birth, and all their futuredescendants, born while their mothers were in such service, shouldserve their several owners until they should arrive at 30 years ofage, and then be free.6.Waltham S EX RS v. ROBERTSON et al. June T. 1830.2 Leigh s Rep. 189.In the year 1819, Francis Waltham made his will, and devised asfollows : " Item, if it be agreeable to the laws of this state, (Virginia)in which I live, that after the death of my said wife Mary, it is my valid, andwill and desire, that the following slaves owned by me, viz. Joan, wSen r, Gary, Jack, Tom, and Peter, shall, as soon as they attain condition ^performed.the age of thirty-one years, be freed ; and I appoint my friends, J.Morris and E. H. Hendrick, trustees for the liberation of saidslaves, and for them to make the necessary application to thecourt on said slaves behalf, both as to their freedom and remainingin the state. If the laws of the state be against such procedure,then my will is, that said slaves be equally divided among mychildren." After the death of the testator s widow, his childrenbrought a bill against the executor, Morris, in the county court ofBuckingham, who decided they were not entitled to their freedomand decreed a division among the plaintiffs. The executor appealedto the superior court of chancery of Richmond, which affirmedthe decree, and then he appealed to this court.Per Cur. Camel, J. The testator, by his will says, if the lawwill suffer my slaves, if emancipated, to remain in Virginia, I freethem. If the laws will not suffer it, I give them to my children.Per Green y J. The question is, whether the testator intendedthat the slaves in question should be freed (to use his own expression)upon his wife s death at all events, unless the law in force316 SLAVERY.when that happened should prohibit emancipation upon any terms ?or, that they should be freed only in the event that the laws shouldthen permit emancipation, and those emancipated to remain in thestate, by leave of the courts, or otherwise. This last was the constructionadopted by the courts below, and I think the constructionthe correct one. The expression, " If the laws of Virginia be against*the said procedure," refers to all which the testator had directedto be done, both to the emancipation of the slaves, and procuringpermission to them to remain in the state. And by the law at thedate of the will, and the testator s death, the slaves could not beallowed to remain in the state. They are not entitled to their freedom,and the decree ought to be affirmed.7.Tucker S ADM R v. GILBERT. May T. 1831. 3 Leigh sRep. 8.As to be Rucker by his will declared, " Item, it is my will and desiredeathVthe that my mulatto man, James Gilbert, should be free ; but findingthere would be some difficulty for it to be so, and for him to remainhere, I therefore request my executors to lay off three acres ofland for said James Gilbert, at any corner of my Tant, and Jet himsettle on it, that he may think proper, and he is to have it duringhis natural life, on good behaviour, and then to return to my estate."After the death of the testator, Gilbert brought a suit in formapauperis 9 against the administrator to recover his freedom, and thecounty court gave judgment in his favor ; and the administratorappealed to the circuit court, which affirmed thejudgrnent, and heappealed to this court.Per Cur. Brooke, J. Did the testator intend Gilbert shouldbe free at his death 1 If he did, the provisions in the will werevery inconsistent. He says, " It is my will and desire that mymulatto man, James Gilbert, should be free." If he had stoppedhere, there would have been no doubt, that James Gilbert wouldhave been free: and here he would have stopped if he had simplyintended to emancipate him ; but finding, as he says, " therewould be some difficulty for it to be so, and for him to remain here"that is, as a freeman, he does not desire his executors to removethat difficulty, by sending him out of the state, but desires them tolay off three acres of land, which he is to have on good behaviour;certainly not as a freeman, because, as such, he could impose noOF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 317such condition upon him ; nor could he, as he has done in the lastmember of the clause, subject him to the control and direction ofhis executors, in the character of a freeman.However much the testator might have desired that Gilbertshould be free, it was very clear, that he was deterred by the difficultieswhich the law presented with respect to residence here,and under the circumstances, determined to do what he considerednext best for him, to settle him for life on a piece of land,there to enjoy the fruits of his own labor. Both judgments reversed,and judgment entered for appelle t.Moose v. Allan. Dec. T. 1825. 16 Martin s LouisianaRep. 99.Appeal from the court of the fourth district.Per Cur. Martin, J. The plaintiff states, that he was, beforethe death of the late Julien Poydras, a slave for life of said Misdirected tobe set freecras ; who bequeathed to all his slaves their freedom, on the fol by the lastlowing conditions : That each of his plantations should be sold, mas ter canwith all the slaves who might be on each of them respectively. ^J^^"2d.

That B. Poydraspurchased one of said plantations, situated at Fausse River,with a number of slaves attached thereto, of which the plaintiff wasone ; and afterwards sold it with the said slaves to one of the defendants,with the conditions mentioned in the will, as aforesaid,which was mentioned at the sale, and inserted in the process verbal.But that the said defendant, in violation of them, sold him to VilleneuveLeblanc the other defendant, who has brought the plaintiffto the parish of West Baton Rouge, against his will and inclina-nation,and intends to remove him out of the state. The petitionconcludes with a prayer for the recession of the sale of Leblanc ;that he maybe ordered and decreed, to restore the plaintiff on theplantation at Fusser River, with which he was sold, and be enjoinedfrom removing him therefrom. The defendant pleaded thegeneral issue. There was judgment for the defendant, and the818 SLAVERY.plaint T appealed. By a clause of the will, the testator directs theterms of sale of his plantations and slaves in the following words :The sales of any of my plantations, as to the slaves which areattached to them, (and all my slaves are to be considered as attachedto them,) is to be made, with the obligation imposed on thepurchaser of my plantations, their heirs and assigns, all the slaves,of either sex, who shall be sold with the said plantations respectively,even the children born or to be born, at the expiration oftwenty-five consecutive years, from the date of the sale. And theslaves, who at this epoch may not have the legal age for emancipation,shall be bound to work for their respective purchasers, theirheirs and assigns, till they reach that age ; when they are to beemancipated as aforesaid. Likewise, the purchasers of my saidplantations are to be bound for themselves, their heirs and assigns,to have care of, and treat with humanity, and keep on said plantationsrespectively, without requiring any labor from them, allsuch slaves so purchased, who may evidently have attained theage of sixty years, and pay them annually a sum of twenty-fivedollars, as a relief against the infirmities of age. These terms areto be rigorously executed, and all persons, in the name of humanity,and particularly the officers of the state, are authorized andrequested by me, to cause them to be executed and respected."The right to remain on the plantation, with which each of the testators slaves was sold, is only given to those who may have attainedthe age of sixty years, at the expiration of twenty-five yearsfrom the sale. In the mean while the right of a purchaser tothe labor of the slaves, wherever he chooses to have it performed,is perfect, unless, perhaps, the slave may be allowed the aid of themagistrate, in case of an evident attempt to transport him out ofthe jurisdiction of the state, in order to frustrate his hope of emancipation,under the will and sale, by compelling the purchaser togive security for the forthcoming of the slave in due time, or otherwise.In the present case, there is no evidence of even an intentionof the defendant, Leblanc, to transport the plaintiff.

The statute prohibits manumission to theprejudice of creditors, of slaves over forty-five, and also of such asshall not be able to work and gain a sufficient maintenance andlivelihood at the time the freedom given shall commence. Clarissa,at the time of the testator s death, was about ten years of age,and claims her freedom by that clause of the will manumitting theyoung negroes. Before Clarissa was twenty-five, she had threechildren, Hannah, Delia, and Edward; after that age she had Edy,and Martha. The mother and five children all sued jointly in thisaction. The circuit court adjudged Clarissa free at twenty-five,and that Martha and Edy, following the condition of the mother,were free, because born after she was free. The court also adjudged,that the three children born before Clarissa was twenty-five,followed the condition of the mother, and would be free at theirrespective ages of twenty-five ; neither of them at the time of the322 SLAVERY.time of the trial being that old. To this part of the charge, andfinding of the jury thereon, error is assigned for the plaintiffs inerror ; and also for the defendants in error, Hannah, Delia, andEdward, who claim to have been born free.This cause has been argued with an anxiety for the defendantsin error, and with an ability on both sides, leaving the court nothingto wish, save something of information of the course of adjudicationin Maryland, if any has been had there on the subject. Withthe lights before us, however, we have come to a conclusion satisfactoryto the majority of the court.The statute of Maryland is open to remark in explanation of thewill. Young slaves incapable of supporting themselves could notbe emancipated, if the freedom given was to commence duringsuch incapacity. When making the will the testator was governedby this restriction in reference to the slave children. The statutedoes not give directly any powers to the testator to control the increaseof the females who were slaves at his death ; yet he havinguncontrolled power of their freedom or slavery, it is perhaps themost consistent construction of the act to say, he had the powerto declare the condition of Clarissa s children born before the freedomcommenced. As to this middle state affecting the three childrenborn before the mother was twenty-five, the legislature hasnot declared its will. And in giving a construction to the willmade pursuant to the statute, the court must bear in mind, theclaim is one involving human liberty, and that the testator s intentionmust be favorably interpreted to this end. 4 Am. Dig. 535. ;1 Wash. Rep. 239. ; 5 Am. Dig., title " Slaves. ;" Cook s Justinian,12. 13. 4. The increase must follow the condition of the mother.If when born she was a slave they are slaves ; if free, theyare free.She was not a slave for life ; this is not insisted on ; but that untilshe attained the age of twenty-five she was a slave. So thecircuit judge thought, and instructed the jury that the three children,were slaves until the age of twenty-five years, when they should befree. Of course, if this construction be the true one, we have inperpetuity, slaves for a term of years ; the descendants of Clarissas daughters must be in the same condition. Let us run outthe consequences of this construction. Such was to have her freedomat the expiration of three years after the testator s death ;Rachel, at the expiration of five years ; Betty, at the expirationOF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 323of two } r ears. At what ages these women were free does not appear.Suppose they had children before the time arrived ? Shouldthey be free at the same age the mother attained when she was free ?This is in accordance to the decision of the circuit court : or shallthey be free at the end of th mother s term ? Had she been a slaveforever, their condition would have been the same. She being aslave for years, their condition could not be worse. The childbefore born is part of the mother, and its condition the same; thebirth does not alter its rights. If the mother at the time of thebirth be free, it is free. Justinian s Institut. by Cooper, 13. Inthis respect, the rule governing slave property in this state and thecivil law are alike. It is confidently believed that no such middleground can be taken in this and similar cases. We find conflictingdecisions on the subject. The case of Pleasants v. Pleasants,2 Call s Rep. 320., decided nothing to afford any aid. It only determinedthat the testator had the right to declare the condition ofthe children of his female slaves.In the case of Maria v. S nbaugh 2 Randolph s Rep. 228., itis holden, that a female slave declared to be free at the age of thirty-one years, and having issue before she arrives at that age, thechildren are slaves for life. But we are told, the question as tothe civil state of the children born before the mother attained theage of thirty-one, depends upon the true construction of the statuteof 1753 of Virgg nia. Upon the policy of that state, growingout of, and evidenced by this and other statutes, is th decisionmainly grounded. It is a most strict construction, not to say aa strained one, in prejudice of human liberty, and is in conflictwith the opinions of Chancellor Wythe and Judge Roam, in thecase of Pleasants v. Pleasants, 2 Call s Rep. 338. In the caseof Ned v. Beal, in Kentucky, 2 Bibb s Rep. 298., the supremecourt held, that a female slave devised to be free in the year 1804,who had children after the testator s death, and before the year1804 was a slave until 1804, and that the children were slaves forlife. With the reasons of this decision we are not satisfied. InNew-jersey, where a will contained the following clause : " I leavemy two negro girls to be sold by my executors for the term of fifteenyears, and at the end of that term to be free," it was held, that thenegroes ceased to be slaves from the time of the sale, and thereforea child born of one of them during the term, was free. 1 Cox sKeep. 36.; 4 Am. Dig. 534.324 SLAVERY.Something in accordance to the principles of this determinationwas decided in Virginia, subsequent to the case of Maria v. Sur-laugh,in Isaac v. West s executor, 6 Rand s Rep. 652.; that if theconstruction of a deed of emancipation be doubtful, resort may be- had to the rule, that the deed is to be taken most strongly againstthe grantor, and liberally construed in favor of liberty ; a rule, growingout of the spirit of the laws of all civilized nations which favorliberty ; that a deed of emancipation, by which the master manuits his slaves at his death, but directs that they shall serve himas long as he lives, and at his death go free from all persons, passesa present right to freedom, reserving a right in the grantor to theirpersonal services during his life as a condition of the emancipation.Therefore, a child born of one of the emancipated females in theinterval between the execution of the deed and the death of thegrantor, is free from its birth. This adjudication proceeds uponthe ground of a vested right of freedom communicated to the female,and placing her on the footing of a person bound to servicefor a term of years, who has a general right to freedom, but thereis an exception out of it by contract. So of the New-jersey decision.Had Clarissa a vested right to freedom on the death ofThomas Bond 1 As to Suck, Rachel, and Betty, and as to theman Bishop, devised for five years to Phil Bond, we think there canbe no doubt they were intended by the testator to be free persons,held to service for a term of years ; nor can we bring our mindsto believe the testator meant differently, than if he had said, I willthat my girl, Clarissa, be free, but that she serve my children forthe term of fifteen years ; being then twenty-five years of age, shewill be able to support herself in compliance with the statute of1796, and will have been raised to industry, and in moral habits bymy children, so that she may the better enjoy her freedom. Furthermore,it is right she should pay for her raising, which by thetime she is twenty-five she will have done. With this explanation,no one will deny that Clarissa would have taken by the will apresent right to freedom at the testator s death, encumbered witha condition to serve fifteen years. In reference to Rachel, Suck,Betty, and Bishop, the testator was sufficiently explicit to the aboveeffect, and we think he manifestly meant the same thing whenemancipating his young negroes. Suppose Suck twenty-two, heknew her age, and he said she should serve until she was twenty-five,and then go free ; how would this have differed from thewords used : "my woman, Suck, to have her freedom at the expi-OF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 325ration of three years after my death ? That Clarissa rested undermostof the disabilities pertaining to a state of slavery, is true ; butthat she took a vested and undoubted right to freedom by Thos.Bond s will, is equally true. The children born of Clarissa, in thestate of Tennessee, came into existence impressed with the rightsour laws confer. They were not the slaves for life, of William Harris.They could only be his slaves until the termination of twenty-fiveyears from the birth of their mother. Her state and conditionfixed that of her increase, during the particular estate, and alsoafter its termination. With us the remainderman takes the increaseof slaves born during the term. Timms v. Potter, 1 Hay w.Rep. 234. ; 2 Yerger s Rep. 586. If the termor has no furthertitle, and there be no one to take in remainder, slavery ceases ofcourse. Such we take to be the condition of the three children bornof Clarissa before she was twenty-five. But as it is insisted, thatthe decisions in Maryland will be conclusive of this cause, contraryto our present impressions, we will hold it up until the next term,so that they may be had, or rather such of them as we have notseen and examined.The cause was argued, and the above opinion prepared at theMarch term, 1833. The case was again argued at this term, afterwhich the chief justice delivered the following opinion of the court :This cause was, at the last term, holden up under advisementto obtain and look into Maryland authorities. The cases of Hamiltonv. Craig, and Chew v. Gary, have been produced to us. 6Har. & Johns. Rep. 16. 526. They established the position, thatif a negro woman slave be given to A. for his life, and at his deaththe slave to be free, the increase born of such woman during thelife estate, are slaves for life, and the property of him to whom theuse is limited. In Maryland, the issue is considered not an accessary,but as a part of the use, like that of other female animals.1 Har. & M Hen. Rep. 160. 352. ; 1 Har. & Johns Rep. 526.;1 Hayww. Rep. 335. Suppose a brood mare be hired for five years,the foals belong to him who has a part of the use of the dam. 2Black. Com. 290.; 1 Hayww. Rep. 335. The slave in Maryland,in this respect, is placed on no higher or different ground. Hadthe defendant, Harris, continued in Maryland, and the threechildren born of Clarissa, before she attained twenty-five years ofage, been born there, they would have been his property, just asmuch as the produce of the labor of Clarissa. But Hannah, Delia,and Edward, were born in Tennessee, and the defendant s right326 SLAVERY.to property in them vested subject to our laws; by which, the firsttaker has the same interest to the increase he has to the mother.Timms v. Potter, 1 Hayww. Rep. 234.; 2 Yergg. Rep. 586.; Cook sRep, 113. 381. Had Clarissa been given to Harris by will in Tennessee,until she arrived at the age of twenty-five, and then overin remainder, Harris would have been entitled to her services forthe term, and to the services of her children for the term ; butthen the mother and also the children would have gone over to theremainderman. When the title of Harris to Clarissa ceased, histitle, by our law, to the three children ceased. That he has noright to their services is manifest.North Carolina adopted the rule of nature, pertaining to humancreatures, in declaring that the condition of the mother should bethat of the child. The law does not seperate the title : they gotothe remainderman together ; and if there be no remaindermanto take the mother, the child goes with her. By Thomas Bond swill, there is no one to take in remainder. His executors were thefirst takers, until the young slaves respectively attained twenty-fiveyears of age, and then they were to go free. Harris, as distributee,took the title the executors had. As first taker, his title endedwhen Clarissa was twenty-five. The executors have no title over,nor has any one.As to Hannah, Delia, and Edward, the judgment will be reversed,and the cause remanded for another trial. As to Clarissaand the other children, the judgment will be affirmed, and they gofree. Green, J., dissented.A devisethat Anna, HART v. FANNY ANN. Oct.

Thesentence thus arranged and simplified, expresses what we thinkthe testator intended, and what is expressed by his words. Afterthe most attentive examination, we are satisfied with the opinionthat the right of Fanny Ann to her freedom is not to be postponedtill she arrives at thirty years of age, but was complete on her mothers attaining thirty years. Judgment affirmed.13.NEGRO GEORGE et al. v. CORSE S ADM R. June T. 1827.2 Har. & Gill s Rep. 1.Petition for freedom.^ The plaintiffs claimed their freedom under the will of James Slaves morse,which contained the following words : " Imprimis, I herebyset free all my negroes of every description, in the fellowmanner, which is to say, the men, George, David, Jim, and Henry, atmy death ; also the women, to wit, Maria, Beck, and Mary, with ttheir issue in case they should have issue between this time and liethe period of my death ; and the boys, as they severally attain theage of twenty-one ; to wit : Isaac eighteen years old, Levi fifteen hdyears old, Sandy, &c.; and the girls at the age of eighteen with freedom -their issue, in case they should have issue ; to wit : Phillis fourteenyears old, and Sally twelve years old. And it is hereby providedf my personal estate, exclusive of the negroes, should notbe sufficient to discharge all my just debts, then my will is that myexecutor or administrator, as the case may be, may sell so much ofmy real estate as will pay my debts, so as to have my negroes freeas before stated."It was admitted that the personal estate of the testator, eitherincluding or excluding the negroes, was not at the time of hisheath, or at any time since, sufficient to pay his debts ; but that hisreal estate, including his personal property, and excluding the.negroes were at the time of his death, and still are, sufficient topay h,s debts. Verdict for defendants and the petitioners appealed328 SLAVERY.After argument the Court, Dorsey, Archer, and Earl, Js., affirmedthe judgment.They observed that until the act of 1796, ch. 67., the manumissionof slaves by will was prohibited, and by the act it couldonly be upon condition that it shall not prejudice creditors. Andthey had a right to their demands out of the personal estate ; andit was not in the power of the debtor (testator) to transfer theirclaims to the real estate; that the executor or administrator hadno means of knowing whether the real estate would be sufficient.And the personal estate is the first fund for the creditor to look tofor the satisfaction of his demand.Earl, J., observed, that it is not in the power of the testator toconfine the creditors to a particular fund for the satisfaction of theirdebts to whose demands the whole of his estate was equally liable.More particularly was it not for him to turn them over from thenatural fund, to one more uncertain and less accessible.14.NOEL AND WIFE v.

She did notrenounce the provision under the will, but held the estate devisednine years. She married Noel, and she and her husband commencedthis suit to recover her dower in the devised slaves.The court of chancery dismissed the bill, and the plaintiffs appealedto this court.The court of appeals were of opinion, that the appellant, by notrenouncing her first husband s will, was barred from recoveringdower in the devised slaves.15.COOKE, (a person of color,) v. COOKE. Spring T. 1823. 3 Litslave tell s Kentucky Rep. 236.cannot be . .emancipate er Q ur , William Cooke entered into an agreement with hisnuncup*- slave, Peter, to emancipate him, on the payment of two hundrednor bea n and fifty dollars ; or, rather, the contract was made with Sethexecutory Cooke and Abraham Bohannon, as agents for the slave, and wasor conti .national in reduced to writing, and signed by them m these words : A statementof a contract made by William Cooke and us, Seth CookeOF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 329and Abraham Bohannon, as agents for Peter, a slave, on the termsfollowing : Said Cooke agrees to emancipate Peter, for two hundredand fifty dollars, with interest on one hundred and twenty-fivedollars from the 4th of June 1815, until paid the balance of theabove two hundred and fifty dollars. Signed, SETII COOKE,June 4th, 1815. ABM. Shannon."In his last illness he made his nuncupative will, reduced to writingat the time it was spoken, but not signed by him, in which he directsthat "Peter should be free, on the payment of fifty dollars, a balanceof $250 which Seth Cooke and Abraham Bohannon, as agents forPeter, had undertaken to pay; which is all paid but the aforesaid fiftydollars." After his death Peter paid the remaining fifty dollars tohis widow, and executrix, and brought this action of trespass, assault,battery, and false imprisonment, against the appellee, to asserthis right of freedom. On the trial, it was proved, that after the dateof the aforesaid contract, Peter went at large as a free person, bythe indulgence of his master, who until his death always recognizedthe rights of Peter to freedom, on the payment of two hundred andfifty dollars. The court, on the application of the appellee s counsel,instructed the jury, that Peter could not support his claim tofreedom, under the writing aforesaid, because it was an executorycontract ; and that the plaintiff s remedy, if any, was in a court ofequity ; and that slaves, when they pass by last will and testament,being considered as real property, could not pass by a nuncupativewill. The jury found a verdict, and a judgment was thereuponrendered against Peter, and he has appealed to this court.However strong an appeal the claim of Peter may make to theconscience or moral sense, we must accord with the court belowin each of these instructions. It has been settled in this country,by the case of Donaldson v. Jude, 2 Bibb s Rep. 57., that thesigning, sealing, and even the acknowledgment or proof of thedeed or will of emancipation, were all necessary requisites to annulthe relation of master and slave. It has been since decided,in the case of Winney v. Cartwright, Spring T. 1821, that theproof or acknowledgment of the instrument was no longer necessary,or even a seal, under a subsequent statute ; but that the rightaccrued at the signing of a writing expressing an emancipation.Still, however, it is necessary that the writing should declare theact done, and not merely a stipulation that it shall be done conditionally,or on the happening of some contingency. So that thisSLAVERY.And aresubject todebts oftestator.writing, even if signed by the deceased master, could not be construedto be more than an engagement to do the very act whichby law would emancipate. And however strong an acknowledgmentthe nuncupative will may contain, of the obligation of thecontract, and that Peter has fulfilled the greater part ; yet, thatslaves, as far as respects wills, must be deemed and held real estate,is expressly declared by the provisions of a statute passed the 26thday of November, 1800. 2 Dig. L. K. 1247. And it is a doctrineso well established, that real estate cannot pass by a nuncupativewill, both according to the provision of our acts of assembly regulatingwills, and by former decisions on similar statutes, that therecan be no need of quoting authority to support it.Judgment affirmed.16.DUNN v. AMY et al. Nov. T. 1820. 1 Leigh s Rep. 465.Amy, James, and Ned, negroes claiming to be free, broughttheir bill in the superior court of chancery of Richmond, charging,that they had been slaves to one Campbell ; that Campbelldied in 1819, having previously made his will, and devised as follows: " I wish Mr. Shepherd, my executor, to emancipate theabove-named Amy and her child James, as also her sister Polly,and her brother Ned, and all their offsprings, should they haveany ; and if possible to have leave granted to remain in the state ;if that cannot be granted, I wish them (I mean Amy the principal)to have the sum of $1,000 as soon as it can be made after myjust debts are paid ; the residue of the money to be converted intoUnited States Bank stock, the dividend to the use of Amy and herchild James, until James arrive at the age of twenty-one years ;at which time I wish them equal in the stock until her death, at whichperiod I wish James to have all the stock, and Polly the house,that is to be left to Amy for her life. If Amy and James shoulddie, I wish Polly and Ned to have the stock and house."The executor, in pursuance of the will, executed deeds of emancipationof the slave, dated January 4th, 1820, and in May Term,1821, Mitchell recovered judgment, the execution to be levied ofassets, quando accident, and the judgment was assigned to Dunn ;and in May, 1826, a^/i, fa was sued out, and levied upon the slaves.The court, Cabal, J., decided, that the slaves were manumittedby the will of Campbell, the testator, and not by the deed of emancipationof the executor; but the slaves were subject, nevertheless*to the testator s debts.OF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 331(C.)

It appears that Joseph was born a slave, and it notappearing that he was ever out of the limits of the state, there is lawno law by which slaves in that situation can obtain freedom, orenjoy the rights of free persons, only by deed in writing, or the lastwill and testament of the owner, duly authenticated and recorded ;but no such deed, or will, or certificate of freedom, in favor ofJoseph, was produced at the trial. It is, therefore, clear, that nodeclaration or promise made to the slave in this state, or for hisbenefit by the owner, or any other person, can be enforced by acourt either of law or equity. And see Will v. Thompson, in anote at the end of the case, where it was held, that where a purchaserin writing contracted with the seller to manumit the slaveat a specified time, is not a ground for a suit at common law ; butequity will enforce the contract, and give damages for the detentionof the negro.332 SLAVERY.contra. 3.slaved NEGRO CATO v.

May T. 1818. 5 Martin s LouisianaRep. 494.Mathews, J., delivered the opinion of the court. The plaintiff,wh J has I a- and appellant, claims her freedom, and that of her children, agreedto ser a con tract between her former master and Cuffy, a freeman,free his "slave for a her father. A copy of the contract comes up with the record,cannot be as well as the proceedings, which took place in a Spanish tribunalto freshly on that contract, by which it appears, that a judgment was rendered,after he fixing the value of each slave who was to be manumitted, undered a partial the stipulations in the contract, and imputing a payment of 310dollars to the benefit of one of them. By what rule of law, orprinciple of justice, the Spanish tribunal acted in its decision, it isuseless to inquire. The matter must be considered as a res judicata,and it is of little importance in deciding the cause, as it is nowplaced before this court. The expressions of the contract itselfshow clearly, that Andrew Administer, the defendant s first husband,and former master of the plaintiff, bound himself to liberatethe slaves mentioned therein, only on the condition of receiving3,400 dollars, the price of their liberty, stipulated between him andCuffy. It does not appear that the sum, or any part of it, was paidto him or his representatives, except 310 dollars, which were imputedon the price of John Baptist, one of the four slaves namedin the contract, by the judgment of the Spanish tribunal ; fromwhich no appeal appears to have been taken, and which fixes anddetermines the appropriation of that sum. But even that sum,were it now to be considerate as a general payment on the contractfor all the slaves named in it, could not avail the present plaintiff.Her counsel relies much on principles of the Roman law;quoties nubia libertas interpretation est. ff. 50. 17. 20., and the lawOF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 333de servo suis numina empty, 40. 1. 40., in which, among other things,it is declared, . 10., that, although the whole price of his freedomshould not be paid by the slave, nevertheless he acquires it, if thedeficiency be afterwards supplied by his labor, or if he should acquireit by his industry. As to the rule requiring the interpretation,in doubtful cases, to be in favor of freedom, it is sufficient to observe,that no one rule of interpretation in law or contracts oughtever to be considered of so much consequence, as to exclude theoperation of others, equally founded in justice and common sense.Freedom must not be so favored by interpretation, as to departentirely from the intention of the contracting parties, apparent onthe contract itself. The law which authorizes the residue of theprice to be supplied by the labor of the person claiming his freedom,as purchased with his own money, or by the circumstance ofacquiring property, is, in our opinion, (and as insisted on by thecounsel of the defendant,) applicable only to such persons as aremade free instanter, on condition of paying a certain sum in futuro.In such a case, when a part of the price of the person is paid, andthe freedman continues to labor for his former master, the value ofhis labor may be fairly imputed as a payment ; or if he be sufferedto act as a free person, and acquire property, he may be compelled,by legal proceedings, to complete the payment of the price of hisfreedom. But, in the case under consideration, the master contractedto give the deed of emancipation of the children of Cuffy,when the latter should have satisfied and paid him 2,400 dollars.This mode of expression demonstrates the intention of the masterto liberate them in futuro, after the fulfilment of the condition onwhich alone they were to be freed, viz. the complete payment ofthe price of their freedom. On tendering the full amount of thesum for which he promised to give them their freedom, (at anytimeperhaps,) they would be entitled to demand their freedom.But, without payment, or an offer to pay, they surely can claim nobenefit under the contract on which they rely. This opinion webelieve to be in conformity with every just rule for the interpretationof contracts. It is supported by the authority to which theplaintiff s counsel has resorted, ff. 40. 7., de statu liberia, in thefifth paragraph of the third law which declares, that the statu libermust fulfil the condition on which he is to be entitled to his freedom,provided he be not hindered, and the condition be possible.It is laid down, that if the condition on which the slave is to be set334 SLAVERY.free, be the payment of a certain sum to the heir of the master,and he does not pay the whole, he shall not obtain his liberty.

Mathews, J. In the course of the trial of this causean agree in the court below, the plaintiff, here the appellant, offered parolthe n fre e r - testimony to prove a contract between the defendant and appelleedom of a an( j herself, whereby the latter, who holds her in slavery, agreed toslave is in r ,admissible, emancipate her on condition of obtaining the reimbursement ot theprice which she had paid for her. This testimony being rejectedby the parish judge, a bill of exceptions was taken to his opinion,on which alone the case comes up before us. The right of theplaintiff to maintain an action for her emancipation and freedom,on this contract, is unequivocally declared. 3 Part. 2. 8. And accordingto the general provisions of the Spanish law, such a contractmay be supported on, and proven by, oral testimony. We are,however, of opinion, that the latter laws are virtually repealed bythe civil code. Slaves are incapable of making any contract forthemselves, except for their freedom an exception to the generalrule allowed in favor of liberty ; and as, in this respect, they assume,in some degree, the standing and condition of free persons, therules of law which direct and govern the contracts of the latter,must be applicable to those of the former, where the object of theagreement is the same. Now, according to our civil code, everycovenant tending to dispose by a gratuitous or incumbered title ofany immovable property must be reduced to writing, and in case theexistence of such covenant should be disputed, no parol evidenceshall be admitted to prove it. Code Civil, 310. art. 241. Thisprinciple we find recognized in the same authority, when it comesto treat of the transfer of title to immovable property and slaves, bysale, or exchange. Id. 344. art. 2. It is therefore clear, thatbetween free persons no valid or binding contract can be made soas to alter the title to slaves, unless it be in writing. And, if wearecorrect in the position above taken, that the same rules mustgovern in covenants to which slaves are allowed to become parties,it is equally clear, that parol evidence ought not to be admitted toestablish the existence of the contract on which the plaintiff, andOF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 335appellant, founds her action ; because it tends to dispose of a slave.The judge of the parish court acted correctly in rejecting the parolevidence. Judgment affirmed.(D.) BY THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN LAWS.1.Langford v. Cotillon. May T. 1824. 14 Martin s LouisianaRep. 401.Per Cur. Martin, J. The plaintiff alleges she is a free woman, If e arvaand the defendant wrongfully detains her in slavery. The issue,liber vel non, has been found in her favor, and the defendant ap move herpealed. She does not pretend that she was born free ; and it is t^ky toadmitted, that if she still be a slave, the defendant derives a title toher immediately from a person who was once her owner. But she di, she becomesfree,alleges, that some years ago her then owner removed from Ken i ipso facto.tucky into Ohio, with the intention of residing there, taking herthither as a part of his family. That the constitution of Ohio provides,that " there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitudein the state ;" that she resided for several years in this man s family,in Ohio, continuing to serve him as before ; that, having made anattempt to assert her freedom, he defeated it by her forcible removalinto Kentucky ; from whence she was brought back into Ohio,and afterwards into Louisiana. Her counsel urges that, as theconstitution of Ohio does not allow slavery in the state, her emancipationor freedom was the inevitable and immediate consequenceof the act of her former owner, in removing her, with the intentionof residing in Ohio ; that, as she was a free woman there,she must be held so every where. The relation of owner andslave is, in the states of this union, in which it has a legal existence,a creature of the municipal law. Although, perhaps, in none ofthem a statute introducing it as to the blacks can be produced, itis believed that, in all, statutes were passed for regulating and dissolvingit. The issue of a female slave is held to be born in thecondition of the mother, the maxim of the Roman law, partussequitur ventrem, being universally recognized. Indians taken captivesin war, have been declared slaves, and the absolute propertyof the captor ; and a kind of temporary slavery has been madethe doom of persons of color guilty of certain breaches of the336 SLAVERY.law. 2 Martin s Revisal of N. C. Laws ; 2 Martin s Digest of theLaws of Louisiana, 172. In most of the states recognizing slavery,laws have been passed to authorize, regulate, or check the emancipationof slaves. In some, as in Pennsylvania, laws have beenmade to abolish or modify slavery. The right of a state to passlaws dissolving the relation of master and servant, is recognized inthe constitution of the United States, by a very forcible implication.This instrument declares, that no person held to service oflabor in one state, under the laws thereof, escaping into another,shall, in consequence of any law or regulation thereof, be dischargedfrom such service or labor. Hence the implication isstrong, that such persons, who do not escape, but whose ownersvoluntarily bring, may be discharged by the laws or regulations ofthe state in which they are so brought. For if this could not be,to what use would be the prohibition 1 The counsel for the plaintiff,presuming that he has thus shown the right of states to dissolvethe relation of owner and slave in other cases than the exceptedone, contends, that the state of Ohio having forbidden itsexistence, the relation is, ipso facto, dissolved, when owners ofslaves, in other states, come with such slaves into Ohio, with theintention of residing there. The words used by the framers of theconstitution being the most forcible ones to express the idea thatevery one in the state should be free. It is argued, that if the relationof owner and slave is a creature of the municipal law, in thesestates, and may be regulated, modified, and dissolved by it, it follows,that when dissolved, according to the law of the domicil ofthe owner and of the slave who lives with him, (if the slave canhave a domicil other than his owner s,) it must be considered everywhere,as having legally ceased to exist.The converse of the proposition is certainly true. An Indiancaptive reduced to slavery under the laws of North Carolina, anda colored man under those of Louisiana, would be considered asthe property of the captor or purchaser, in every state in the Unionin which the slavery of Indians or negroes is allowed. So, slaveslegally emancipated, according to the law of the domicil of theowner, would be supported in the enjoyment of their freedom.So, the incipient right to freedom of the issue of a female slave,registered according to the laws of Pennsylvania, would prevail inKentucky, notwithstanding her removal to the latter state.

Legum.But the plaintiff s counsel says, the constitution of Ohio did not,on her removal, ipso facto, vest freedom on her, but conferred onlythe right of procuring it to be decreed by the tribunals of that state.That the provision being a. penal one, ought not to be enforced bythe courts of other states That the acquisition of freedom by theplaintiff, or what is the same thing, the. forfeiture of the owner sright, cannot be incidentally pronounced, and cannot be decreed,except by a judgment in a suit against him, whose right is to bedestroyed. Had the framers of the constitution of Ohio intendedthat slavery might exist in that state, in the persons who might beremoved thither, until certain formalities should be complied with,they would have used different words. It would be idle for a courtto decree, that thereafter slavery cannot exist in A. B., when theconstitution proclaims that it exists in no one in the state. Thearticle of the constitution is not a penal one, and denounces noforfeiture. Penalty and forfeiture essentially presuppose the omissionof an act commanded, or the commission of one forbidden.The article does neither command nor forbid any act. It warnsowners of slaves in other states, removing into Ohio, to sell orleave them behind, if they are not intended to be emancipated, andpromises emancipation to all slaves brought in, or permitted tocome in, on their master s entering the state with the view of fixingtheir domicil in Ohio. A penalty or forfeiture cannot be decreedwithout a prosecution and conviction, and must ordinarily be suedfor within a given period. In almost every case of removal, theconsequences of it are acknowledged and submitted to. How thenis the new citizen of Ohio to be prosecuted, and of what is he tobe convicted 1 Should a citizen of a neighboring state, whereemancipation may be forbidden, restricted, or attended with expense,consent to allow a slave to go and enjoy his freedom inOhio, is the grateful slave to arrest and prosecute his former owner,the first time he accidentally comes to Cincinnati ? and if he nevercomes, and as no forfeiture can be decreed without the defendantbeing brought in, or at least cited, will slavery, in spite of the constitution,exist in Ohio, until the former owner comes into thatstate, and be served with process ? If the freedom of the former slaveshall be a forfeiture, which is to be decreed in an action, and theowner die before he is sued, so that the pretended offence die with338 SLAVERY.him, will slavery exist for ever in Ohio 1 We conclude, that theconstitution of the state of Ohio emancipates ipso facto such slaveswhose owners remove them into that state, with the intention ofresiding there.That the plaintiff having been voluntarily removed into the stateby her then owner, the latter submitted himself, with every memberof his family, white and black, and every part of the propertybrought with him, to the operations of the constitution and lawsof the state ; and that, as according to them, slavery could not existin his house. Slavery did not exist there, and the plaintiff was,accordingly, as effectually emancipated by the operation of theconstitution, as if by the act and deed of her former owner ; thatshe could not be free in one state, and a slave in another ; that herfreedom was not impaired by his forcibly removing her into Kentucky,to defeat her attempt to assert her freedom ; nor by hersubsequent removal, voluntary or forced, into this state. Thisopinion is in conformity with that of the court of appeals of Virginia.Bibb. 2 Marshall s Rep. 467. It can work injury to noone ; for the principle acts only on the willing, and violent TIM fitinjuria. The plaintiff s counsel has laid great stress on the formerowner of the plaintiff removing into Ohio, with the intention ofsettling, and it is this circumstance which governs the case. Inthe decision of the court of appeals of Kentucky, it is expresslysaid, that slaves attending their master s sojourning in, or travellingto Ohio, are not thereby emancipated. As this point has no bearingon the present case, it is useless to consider it. Judgment affirmed,with costs.2.STEWART v. Makes. Dec. T. 1813. 5 Har. & Johns. Rep.107.

To clear away the difficulties arising from extrane-inthe V Hm vous matter > and to place the grounds of this opinion plainly beforeits of the the court, a short history of the country will be necessary. TheNorthwestTerritory country was within the chartered limits of Virginia, but from thefreemen, 3 near - until ^ e P ea ce of 17C3, it was subject to and claimedby virtue of by France. By the peace of 63, it was ceded to Great Britain.the ordi- .nance of It will appear by reference to the proclamation of Gen. Gage, incan 7 assert ^^5, and to the acts of Col. Wilkins, in granting lands as governor^ ^^ nobis that it was under a government distinct and spainthe rate from the then colony of Virginia. During our revolutionarythis state! war > li was conquered by the arms of Virginia ; but there has beenexhibited no evidence to show that the laws of Virginia were everextended to that country after its conquest, or that Great Britain,after the treaty of 63, by which she obtained it, ever changed thelaws then existing in the province. I have carefully examined theacts of Virginia, and can find no provision extending its laws toOF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 341that district of country. I think, then, that it is undeniable, thatthe laws as they existed while it was a province of France, werethe municipal laws of the country. This opinion is supported bythe treaty of cession from Virginia to the United States, and alsoby the ordinance of 1787. The treaty of cession provides, thatthe French and Canadian inhabitants, and other settlers who professthemselves citizens of Virginia, shall ha r e their poss sion andtitles confirmed, and be protected in the enjoyment of their rightsand liberties. We find that until the governor and judges shalladopt laws, the manner of passing and transferring estates andsale of personal property declared ; saving to the French and Canadianinhabitants, and other settlers of the Kaskaskias and Vincennes,and other villages, the laws and customs now in forceamong them relative to the descent and conveyance of property.If the laws of Virginia were extended to them, there could existno possible necessity of making the saving clause.The question that necessarily arises is, in what relation did theystand to Virginia ? As a province, must be the answer ; andin this condition they passed to the United States under the treatyof cession of Virginia. It is an unquestionable rule, that the lawsequally effect all persons and all property within the territoriallimits of a state or province, unless there be some special reservation.Wherever a person lives, he puts himself, for the time, underthe protection of the laws of the place ; and John Decker hadno privilege distinct from the French and Canadian inhabitants.In the treaty of cession they were not parties, but the subject inpart of the treaty. The clause quarantine their titles, possessions,rights and liberties, was a matter of favor, and designed fortheir exclusive benefit. They not being in a situation to contractfor themselves, the sovereign made the contract. The cession ofLouisiana is an apt illustration. The rights and privileges theypossess arise from the treaty of cession. That the sovereign of aconquered country can make such changes, alterations, and dispositions,as he may think proper, is a principle too well established torequire the citation of authorities to support. But it is said, thata treaty is a sacred instrument, and cannot be violated. This isadmitted ; but the question then arises, is the clause in the ordinanceprohibiting slavery, or involuntary servitude, a violation ofthe treaty of cession ? Before an act of congress is declared inoperative,for violating fundamental principles, the court ought to342 SLAVERY.be fully and completely satisfied. I have endeavored to show inwhat condition these people were after the conquest of Virginia,what rights they possessed, and the rights they acquired under thetreaty of cession. From the facts, authorities, and reasons advanced,these consequences result, that, as conquered countries,they were subject to such laws as the conquerers chose to impose ;that the legislature of Virginia, not making any change in theirlaws, the ancient laws remained in full force, and that the " titles,possessions, rights and liberties," guarantied, were those they enjoyedprior to the conquest, the " lex loci" not as citizens of Virginia,but as a provincial appendage. We will now come to theordinance, and the sixth article of the compact, which declares,there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in saidterritory, otherwise than for the punishment of crimes, whereofthe party shall be duly convicted." Preceding the sixth article,it is ordained and declared, that the six articles shall be consideredas articles of compact, between the original states and thepeople and states in said territory, and forever remain unalterable,unless by common consent. The legislature of Virginia assigns,as one of the reasons for the alteration made in the treaty of cession,that it was to ratify and confirm the said article of compactbetween the original states and the people and states of the said territoryThat the sovereign may contract with the people, is anacknowledged principle ; and the only question is, whether thecompact shall be obligatory on the parties. That the people ofthe territory were parties is evident ; that their condition waschanged from absolute subjection, to the condition of freemen, isequally clear.Then the question is, did not congress give a valuable considerationfor the concession by the people in the sixth article, the privilegesand immunities of freemen, for the freedom of their slaves ;and have not the petitioners a right to claim the benefit of thisarticle 1 But it is contended, that the treaty of cession is obligatoryand binding, and not to be altered, not even by the peoplethemselves.Let us for a moment examine the nature and quality of the provisionquarantine their titles and possessions, rights, and liberties ;does it relate to their political or civil condition ? If the latter, isit not merely a personal benefit 1 And, as such, they have a rightto dispose of it. To say they could not dispose of their property,OF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 343would be denying them a privilege inseparable from property andits dominion. If they could dispose of it individually, what reasoncan be offered why they should be debarred, in their character ofa people, from contracting with their government for the freedomof American citizens? To my mind there can be none. But itis said to be a fair construction of that clause in the ordinance,that, notwithstanding the express words that there shall not beslavery or involuntary servitude except for crimes, and afterconviction, yet the petitioners must be slaves, by the potency of theclause in the treaty of cession " that their titles and possessions,rights and liberties, shall be secured by them." For my own part,viewing as I do the clause of the ordinance as a compact betweenthe original states and the people and states of said territory, it istoo plain to require construction. In doubtful matters, we resortto construction ; but to give it the construction contended for bythe defendant s counsel would contradict what it so clearly declares.The ordinance provides, that there shall be neither slavery nor involuntaryservitude, otherwise than for the punishment of crimes,excluding all kinds of servitude, except that which follows a conviction.But according to the construction of the defendant scounsel, those who were slaves at the passing of the ordinancemust continue in the same situation. Can this construction becorrect 1 Would it not defeat the great object of the generalgovernment 1 It is obvious it would, and it is inadmissible uponevery principle of legal construction. Considering the six articlesof compact equally obligatory and binding, made upon sufficientconsideration, all the objection, as to the want of power in congressto make the compact with the people of the said territory,must vanish. Another point in this case was relied on, namely :that if the petitioners were not freed by the 6th article of theordinance, they became so by the adoption of the constitution ofIndiana. Even the power of the people, in their sovereign capacity,is denied, to effect a general emancipation. To test this, wemust first inquire into the source of sovereignty, as understood inthese United States, to reside in the people. In all governmentswhatsoever there must be, of necessity, and in the nature of things,a supreme, irresistible, absolute, and uncontrolled authority, inwhich the "jura summit imperil" or the rights of sovereignty reside,and when we speak of sovereignty in this sense, it is in contradistinctionof the powers given under a constitution, or the powers ofa limited government, that a constitution emanates from, and is a344 SLAVERY.part of that sovereignty in its most extensive sense, as residing inthe people, is universally acknowledged by all those best acquaintedwith the theory and principles of our government. That thesame power that creates, can change, alter, or destroy, is a consequencetoo clear to require it to be supported by proof. Thepeople restrain the power under a delegated authority, but put norestraint upon themselves. The sets of the supreme power,though contrary to natural rights, are nevertheless binding.In every case under the social compact th; re mm the an inequalityto destroy the validity of the surrender. Among an ignorant anduninstructed people, what are the rights surrendered ? Rousseau,in his Social Compact, informs us, it is the total alienation of everyindividual with all his rights and privileges to the whole community,and assigns the reasons, as one gives himself up entirely, and withoutreserve, and all are in the same circumstances, so no one canbe interested in rendering burthensome their common connection.And again, he says, as the surrender is made without restraint, noone has any thing to retain, if any one had a right distinct fromanother, which he pretended had not been surrendered, each individualmight question the acts of the social compact ; and if thiswas permitted, it would destroy itself, as there would be no commonumpire to appeal to : a state of nature would exist, and thesocial compact be a splendid bauble. Assume the principles laiddown as acknowledged, and they do appear to me to be so wellestablished by all jurists and constitutional writers, as merely torequire them to be stated, in order to ensure their admission. Thequestion then resolves itself into this : What were the rights delegatedby the people to the convention, or what was the trust orpower of that convention ? Was all, or only a part of the sovereigntycommitted to them ? and if a part, where are the restrictions to befound 1 The ordinance only restricts ; and these restrictions areto be found only in the articles of compact, and relate simply tothe nature of the government to be formed. And that the principlesare not inconsistent with the articles of compact, and one ofthose very articles is recognized, and made a part of their constitution,under which the petitioners claim their freedom. Andhow is this claim to be got over 1 Why, we are told, it is inconsistentwith the constitution of the United States, and the treaty ofcession from Virginia. The answer to the latter will be found inthe opinion given on the first point ; and the very reasons the courthave urged, as to the defendants not having been parties to theOF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 345ordinance, apply in fact to the constitution of the United States;and, as I have already shown, they were parties to the six articlesof compact. The constitution of the United States has nothing todowith this question ; and before it could apply, Indiana wasreceived as one of the members of the Union ; and this was subsequent,and grew out of the adoption of their constitution. If,then, I am correct in opinion, that the clause of the constitutionof the United States is inapplicable, (and there is nothing in thetreaty of compact, contained in the ordinance, inhibiting the conventionthe power to free the petitioner,) by what right are theyheld 1 All those principles assumed must be fallacious. Freedomwas extended to the slaves in Massachusetts by their constitution.I have it from high authority, and I have examined theirstatutes, and can find no general statute of emancipation. Andso guarded was our convention upon this subject, that they inhibitedthe legislature from the exercise of the power Pennsylvania*Delaware, New-jersey, New-york, and the New England States,Massachusetts excepted, have legislated on this subject ; and thatit is a proper subject of legislative interference, when not restrainedby the constitution, is evident by the caution of our convention,and the exercise of the power by the several legislatures beforementioned.But we are told that the treaty of cession intervenes. If old Deckerwas not a party to the articles of compact, it cannot be denied butthat he was, or those who claim under him were parties to the constitutionof Indiana. If he was, how can he claim a particularexemption from the operation of the constitution, according to theprinciples of the social compact before laid down ? And if inequalitywas to exempt, would it not tend to destroy it? Does notthe first article of the constitution declare the condition of thepeople of Indiana free ? and this condition, by the last section ofthe first article, is likewise declared to be out of the control ofgovernment, or to be a right reserved to the people. Under asimilar provision, slavery was abolished in Massachusetts ; and byart. 9. sec. 7. of the constitution, the sixth section of the ordinanceis adopted ; and in art. 9. sec. 4. all laws conflicting with the provisionsof the constitution are repealed. scan it be that slaveryexists in Indiana? If it does, language loses its force, and a constitutionintended to protect rights, would be illusory and insecureindeed. If the language is plain, saying there shall be neither346 SLAVERY.slavery nor involuntary servitude, does it comport with thetuition to say there shall be slavery ? This dilemma cannot be gotover by those who give it a construction that would make the petitionersslaves. Why resort to construction in a case so plain ?Do the runs of construing statutes apply to a constitution ? Wheredoes the power reside of restraining the people in their sovereigncapacity ? Is there any such power recognized ? Are we not toldthat the parliament of England can pass any law, however it mayviolate first principles, and the courts would be bound to enforceit. It is in vain to attempt to bind that which is in itself illimitable,irresistible, and supreme. But it is contended, that the provisionsof the constitution admit of a different construction ; that it is prospective; and to give it the meaning its language imports, wouldviolate vested rights. What are these vested rights ? Are theyderived from nature, or from the municipal law ? Slavery is condemnedby reason and the laws of nature. It exists, and can onlyexist, through municipal regulations, and in matters of doubt, is itnot an unquestioned rule, that courts must lean in favored vitae etUbertatis ? Admitting it was a doubtful point, whether the constitutionwas to be considered prospective in its operation or not,the defendants say you take from us a vested right arising frommunicipal law .T he petitioners say, you would deprive us of anatural right guarantied by the ordinance and constitution. Howshould the court decide, if construction was really to determine it ?I presume it would be in favor of liberty. From the view I havetaken I am satisfied, that the petitioners are entitled to have theverdict confirmed, and the motion for a new trial overruled.6.Sports v. Gillespie. Nov. T. 1828.

We think the plaintiff is entitled to her freedom, andthe judgment of the superior court ought to be affirmed. Thecase appears to be clearly embraced by the law r of Pennsylvania.It includes all children born of slaves after the passage thereof, towhomsoever their mothers might belong, whether citizens of Pennsylvaniaor other states. The power of the state of Pennsylvaniato change the condition of persons held under its law 8(and no other) in slavery cannot be questioned, especially if theywere not then the property of a citizen of another state, which isnot the case before the court. When the act was passed, Gilchrist sproperty in Hannah, and her condition as a slave, were subject tothe laws of Pennsylvania. It might, and did change the characterof his property in her, and in so far, her condition as a slave. Beforethe act of 1780, he held an absolute property in her and herchildren then to be born. Afterwards, though his property in herwas, as to her services, the same, her condition was so changedthat she could not be the mother of a slave in Pennsylvania, andhis property to that extent was changed. The law of Pennsylvaniawas, as regarded his property in her and her condition, executed.His will could not effect this state of things. He mightpass his qualified property in her, and her future offspring, accordingto the provisions of the act, but it could not alter the then condition,either of Hannah or her offspring born afterwards : theyremained as before. Susanna, the plaintiff, was born under itsoperation in Pennsylvania : by it, though born of a slave, she wasfree ; and in this aspect of the case, the court is not called ontoexecute the law of Pennsylvania, but the law of Virginia, whichdoes not now and did not then permit a person free in Pennsylvaniato be held in slavery here. Judgment affirmed.Louis v. CABARRUS et al. Aug.

The jury found the plaintiff a freeman.On the appeal the court reversed the judgment below, on theground that proof of the residence of a slave in a free state, theconstitution of which forbids slavery during the space of two orthree years, unconnected with any other proof, is insufficient in lawto entitle such slave to freedom ; and they observed farther, that aresidence of the slave contrary to will, or without the consent ofthe owner, does not deprive the owner of his right to his property.8.NEGRO DAVID v.

This fact was submitted to the consideration of the jury,who tried the cause under the charge of the judge, which we considerto be correct, and was found in favor of the party whoseliberty is claimed. Being free for one moment in France, it wasnot in the power of her former owner to reduce her again toslavery.10.Forth et a), v. NASH. June T. 1816. 4 Martin s LouisianaRep. 385.Per Cur. Martin, J. The plaintiffs in this case claim the de ^ H ^| ro refendant, a negro man, as their slave. It therefore behoves them sued treeto show slavery in him and property in them. The evidence adducedfor this purpose is, 1st. A bill of sale by which the defendantwas sold to them " to have and to hold the said negro man, and to chase wasdispose of him as they shall think proper." This instrument, in a count .bearing date the 5th of September, 1803, was executed at Detroit, ^.^ plainthe territory of Michigan, was there recorded, and is duly au very is notauthenticated. 2d.

The depositionof Nicholas Gird, who swears, that while he was mayor ofNew Orleans the defendant was brought before him, and confessedhe was a runaway, and belonged to some person the name of whomthe witness does not recollect, who had promised him his freedom.4th. The deposition of A. B. Duchouquet, of St. Louis,who swore he never saw the defendant in the possession of theplaintiffs, because the plaintiffs lived at Peoria, in the Illinois territory; that the plaintiff, Forsyth, employed him in 1813, to stopthe defendant ; that he took him up in New Orleans, and broughthim before the mayor, where he confessed he had ran away fromthe plaintiffs, and did not like to return to them on account of awife and children he had in New Orleans. 5th. The deposition ofPierre Le Vasseur, who knew the defendant in Peoria, in the Illinoisterritory, about ten years ago. He was known and reputedto be a slave ; the witness knew him in the possession of Forsythfor four years. He ran away from Peoria, about six years ago.350 SLAVERY.The w the r s some time after met him at Maupertuis, in the Illinoisterritory, and the defendant said he had ran away from his masteran 1 was going to St. Louis. On these facts, the counsel contends,that the slavery of the defendant, and the property of the plaintiffs,are fully proven.1st. The evidence of slavery resulting from the color of the defendant.Delle v. Beauregard, 1 Martin s Rep. 183. ; from hisdeclarations that he had a master ; that he belonged to a man whohad promised him his freedom ; from his attempt to justify his unwillingnessto return ; by the circumstances of his having a wifeand children in New Orleans, thereby tacitly admitting the obligationhe was under of returning to the plaintiffs.2d. The property of the plaintiffs is said to be proven by the billof sale.The defendant s counsel shows, that in the territories of Michiganand the Illinois, the only place except New-Orleans and St.Louis, which the defendant appears to have inhabited, slavery doesnot exist ; that it is forbidden by law. The ordinance of congressof the year 1797, providing that "there shall be neither slaverynor involuntary servitude in the said territory, otherwise than forthe punishment of crimes, whereof the party shall have been con.,viewed. Provided, that any person escaping into the same, from whomlabor or service is lawfully claimed in any one of the original states,such fugitive may be lawfully reclaimed, and conveyed to the personclaiming his or her services aforesaid." Hence, in the opinionof the counsel, a presumption arises, that the defendant is free,which sovereigns the contrary presumption which arises from thecolor. It is further contended, that as the bill of sale could conveyno title, unless the defendant had been duly convicted of a crime, orincase he owed services in one of the original states, and had escapedinto the Michigan territory, the plaintiffs are bound to bring thedefendant within one of these two cases ; that if the defendantwas convicted of a crime, by which he became bound to involuntaryservice, the record of this conviction ought to be produced ;so ought, in the other case, evidence of the duty of involuntary servicein one of the original states, and of escape into the territory ;that the apparent unlawfulness of the authority exercised by theplaintiffs over the defendant, to which he may have submitted fromhis ignorance of his right, or of the means of asserting it, is notrepelled by his admission that he had a master, that he belonged toa person who had promised him his freedom. For while it appearsOF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 351that the plaintiffs de facto, though not de jure, kept the defendantfor a number of years in servitude, it cannot seem extraordinarythat he should refer to them by the appellation of his masters ; andthe alleged promise of freedom may well be presumed to have beenmade to allure the defendant into submission. Neither is it said,can the admission of the defendant, that he ran away, be receivedas conclusive evidence of a legal obligation to stay : flight from unlawfulservitude being more generally resorted to, than the boldassertion of freedom. Kept for a number of years, perhaps fromhis birth, in bondage, the spirit of the injured negro is said to havebeen borne down by the influence which long exerted mastery creates.We are of opinion, that as the case affords no evidence ofany residence of the defendant in any country in which slavery islawful, this case must be determined by the laws of the country inwhich the defendant dwelt when he came to the hands of the plaintiffs; that the ordinance of 1787, having proclaimed that slaveryshould not exist there, unless under two exceptions, the plaintiffmust bring the defendant under either of them, and having failedto do so, must have their claim rejected. Whenever a plaintiffdemands, by suit, that a person whom he brings into court as adefendant, and thereby admits to be in possession of his freedom,should be declared to be his slave, he must strictly make out hiscase. In this, if any, adore non probate absolving reus. Herethe plaintiffs have failed in a very essential point, proof of the allegedslavery of the defendant.Their title can only have been lawful at the time the bill of saleproduced was made, on two grounds : the right of the vendor, orthe liability of the object of the sale, must have been absolute orqualified. Absolute, viz : complete ownership and slavery, in thesole case of conviction of a crime by which freedom was forfeited.Qualified, viz : the right of reclaiming and conveying the defendantout of the territory into one of the original states, in which he owedinvoluntary servitude or labor. This qualified right could only existin the case of the defendant s escape. Now, it cannot be contended,that this qualified right only was disposed of; that whichis the evident object of the sale, is the absolute right to have and tohold during the natural life, and to dispose as they please. Theconduct of the plaintiffs towards the defendant shows, that it wasthis absolute right which they considered themselves as the purchasersof. This they unlawfully attempted to do, and did successfullyfor a number of years exercise, till the defendant sought his safety352 SLAVERY.in flight. Their title to him, if it exists, must be grounded on hisconviction of a crime. Now, the evidence of this is a matter of record; the paper must be produced or accounted for. The parishcourt erred in sustaining the plaintiff s claim ; its judgment is,therefore, annulled, avoided, and reversed ; and this court doth order,adjudge, and decree, that there be judgment for the defendant,with costs.THE STATE v. Laquelle. July T. 1820. 1 Beckford s IndianaRep. 60.Appeal from the Knox circuit court. Polly, a woman of color,was brought before the circuit court by Lasselle, in obedience to awrit of habeas COT P U8 > He stated in his return, that he held her bystate of In purchase as his slave, she being the issue of a colored womanthe^xpress purchased from the Indians in the territory northwest of the rivertoe rd consilio > P previous y to the treat J f Granville, and cession of thattuition. territory to the United States. The court below remanded thewoman to the custody of Lasselle.Per Cur. Scott, J. The question before this court is as to thelegality of Lasselle s claim to hold Polly as his slave. This questionhas been presented before us with an elaborate research intothe origin of our rights and privileges, and their progress until theformation of our state government, in 1816. On one hand, it iscontended, that by the ordinance for the government of the territorynorthwest of the river Ohio, and by the constitution of Indiana,slavery was, and is, decidedly excluded from this state ; while,on the other hand, it is insisted, that by the act of cession of thestate of Virginia, and by the ordinance of 1787, the privilege ofholding slaves was reserved to those settlers at Kaskaskias and ( St.Vincent, and the neighboring villages, who, prior to that time, hadprofessed to be citizens of Virginia ; and that they had a vestedright, which could not be divested by any provision of the constitution.In deciding this case, it is not necessary for us to recur tothe earliest settlement of the country, and inquire what rights thefirst emigrants enjoyed, as citizens of Virginia ; or what privilegeswere secured to them, when their connection with that state wasdissolved. Whether the state of Virginia intended, by consentingto the ordinance of 1787, to emancipate the slaves on this side ofthe Ohio river, or whether, by the reservation alluded to, she intendedto continue the privilege of holding slaves to the settlersOF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 353then in the country, is unimportant in the present case. That legislativeauthority, uncontrolled by any constitutional provision,could emancipate slaves, will hardly be denied. This has beendone in several of the states, and no doubt has been entertained,either of the power of the legislature to enact such a statute, orof the binding force and efficacy of the law when enacted. Bythe power of a statute an estate, may be made to cease, in thesame manner as if the party possessing it were dead. A manmay, by statute, be made an heir, who could not otherwise be one.The legislature have the power to change the course of descents,so as to cast an estate upon those who, otherwise, could neverhave taken it by inheritance. This doctrine is sanctioned by theauthority of Coke, Levant, Blackstone, Bacon, and others of thefirst respectability. It must be admitted, that a convention, chosenfor the express purpose, and vested with full power, to form a constitutionwhich is to define, limit, and control the powers of thelegislature, as well as the other branches of the government, mustpossess powers, at least equal, if not paramount, to those of anyordinary legislative body. From these positions it clearly follows,that it was within the legitimate powers of the convention, in formingour constitution, to prohibit the existence of slavery in thestate of Indiana. We are, then, only to look into our own constitution,to learn the nature and extent of our civil rights ; and tothat instrument alone we must resort for a decision of this question.In the first article of the constitution, section 1st, it is declared,"That all men are born free and independent, and have certainnatural, inherent, and unalienable rights ; among which are, theenjoying and defending of life and liberty, and of acquiring, possessing,and protecting property ; and pursuing and obtaining happinessand safety." Section 24th of the same article, guards againstany encroachment on those rights, and provides that they shallforever remain inviolable. In the lath article of that instrument,section 7th, it is declared, that " There shall be neither slavery norinvoluntary servitude in this state, otherwise than for the punishment ofcrimes, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted." It is evidentthat, by these provisions, the framers of our constitution intendeda total and entire prohibition of slavery in this state ; and we canconceive of no form of words in which that intention could havebeen more clearly expressed. We are told that the constitutionrecognizes pre-existing rights, which are to continue, as if no354 SLAVERY.change had taken place in the government. But it must be recollected,that a special reservation cannot be so enlarged by constructionas to defeat a general provision.If this reservation were allowed to apply in this case, it wouldcontradict, and totally destroy, the design and effect of this part ofthe constitution. And it cannot be presumed that the constitution ,which is the collected voice of the citizens of Indiana, declaring theirunited will, would guaranty to one part of the community such privilegesas would totally defeat and destroy privileges and rightsguarantied to another. From these premises it follows, as an irresistibleconclusion, that, under our present form of government,slavery can have no existence in the state of Indiana ; and, ofcourse, the claim of the said Lasselle cannot be supported. Thejudgment is reversed, with costs, and the woman discharged.12.GRIFFITH v. FANNY. Dec. T. 1820. Gilmer s VirginiaRep. 143.A negro Fanny sued Griffith, in forma pauperis, for her freedom, in thevirtute in superior court of law for Wood county. The defendant pleadedde h ra deed "not guilty," and specially that Fanny was his slave. At the trial,^cutedin t ^ e j fury f noun( j by a special verdict, that Fanny was the slave of onea citizen of Kincheloe, until a short time before the 23d of August, 1816. Someto time in that month he sold her to William Skinner, a citizen residentin the state of Ohi In conformity y with the sale Kincheloetutionof delivered possession to Skinner at Marietta in Ohio, and receivedthe purchase money. Griffith was present at this sale ; and on the23d of August, 1816, Kincheloe executed a bill of sale for Fanny,to Griffith, which bill was delivered to Skinner. This bill was anabsolute sale of Fanny from Kincheloe to Griffith, who was at thetime, and continued to be, a citizen of Virginia. The agreementto have a bill of sale executed to Griffith, was between him andSkinner ; for Kincheloe was not party to their contract, thoughhe executed the deed. At the time of its execution, Skinnerstated to Kincheloe, that he wished the bill of sale to be to Griffith,because by the laws of Ohio he could not hold a slave in his own right .Fanny was at different times seen at Skinner s residence in Ohio.She was last seen there, in the spring of 1818. About the first ofOctober 1818, she returned to Virginia, where she was taken intothe possession of Griffith, who claimed her under the bill of sale.The section of the constitution of Ohio, prohibiting involuntaryOF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 355servitude, was inserted into the verdict. And upon these facts,the law of the case was submitted to the court, which gave judgmentfor the pauper, and Griffith appealed.By the court. The judgment is affirmed.WILSON v. ISBELL.

Fleming, J. The case is clearly within the mischiefwhich was intended to be remedied by the act of 1778 ; and itmakes no difference that the slave in question was born in thisstate, and brought back by a citizen of this commonwealth ; andthat her former master afterwards returned and resided in Virginia,For he had carried her to Maryland, where he dwelt for severalyears, and then sold her to the appellant, who imported her intothis state, in manifest violation of the express declaration of thestatute, and therefore must abide the consequences. The otherjudges concurred, and the judgment was affirmed.A negroRAWLINGS v. BOSTON.

Aug.1836.Habeas corpus to bring up the body of a negro female slave, And wherenamed Med. Aves returned to the writ, that he had the body of tationisvo-the slave in his custody, that one Samuel Slater, of the city of New an( j fo r aOrleans, in the State of Louisiana owned the slave Med, who was an {f^J 30 ^ 1 ^infant about six years of age, and also the mother of the said infant slave isslave. And that he held the mother and child as slaves, under thelaws of Louisiana. That the wife of Slater, intending to visit herparents in Boston, brought the slave Med with her to her father s thedefendant s house, to wait upon her, and for temporary and veryshort time, when she was to return to New Orleans with the slave,that the defendant, the father of the said Mrs. Slater, had the custodyof the child during a temporary absence of her mistress fromthe city. That the child wished to return, and the mother of thechild wished and expected it to return, &c.Shaw, Ch. J. The question now before the court arises upona return to a habeas corpus, originally issued in vacation, by Mr.Justice Wilde, for the purpose of bringing up the person of acolored child named Med, and instituting a legal inquiry into thefact of her detention, and the causes for which she was detained.By tha provisions of the revised code, the practice upon habeascorpus is somewhat altered. In case the party complaining, or inbehalf of whom complaint is made, on the ground of unlawful imprisonment,is not in the custody of an officer, as of a sheriff ordeputy, or corresponding officer of the U. S., the writ is directedto the sheriff, requiring him or his deputy to take the body of theperson thus complaining, or in behalf of whom complaint is thusmade, and have him before the court or magistrate issuing thewrit, and to summon the party alleged to have or claim the custodyof such person, to appear at the same time, and show thecause of the detention. The person thus summoned is to make astatement under oath, setting forth all the facts fully and particularly; and in case he claims the custody of such party, thegrounds of such claim must be fully set forth. This statement isin the nature of a return to the writ, as made under the formerpractice, and will usually present the material facts upon which358 SLAVERY.the questions arise. Such return, however, is not conclusive ofthe facts stated in it ; but the court is to proceed and inquire intoall the alleged causes of detention, and decide upon them in asummary manner. But the court may, if occasion require it, adjournthe examination, and in the mean time bail the party, or commithim to a general or special custody, as the age, health, sex,and other circumstances of the case may require. It is furtherprovided that when the writ is issued by one judge of the courtin vacation, and in the mean time, before a final decision, thecourt shall meet in the same county, the proceedings may be adjournedinto the court, and there be conducted to a final issue, inthe same manner as if they had been originally commenced by awrit issued from the court. I have stated these provisions themore minutely, because there have been as yet but few proceedingsunder the revised statutes, and the practice is yet to be established.Upon the return of this writ before Mr. Justice Wilde, a statementwas made by Mr. Aves, the respondent ; the case was thenpostponed. It has since been fully and very ably argued beforeall the judges, and is now transferred to and entered in court, andstands here for judgment, in the same manner as if the writ hadbeen originally returnable in court.The return of Mr. Aves states, that he has the body of the coloredchild described, in his custody, and produces her. It furtherstates, that Samuel Slater, a merchant, citizen and resident in thecity of New-Orleans and state of Louisiana, purchased the childwith her mother in 1833, the mother and child being then andlong before slaves by the laws of Louisiana ; that they continuedto be his property, in his service, at New-Orleans, till about thefirst of May last, when Mary Slater, his wife, the daughter of Mr.Aves, left New Orleans for Boston, for the purpose of visiting herfather, intending to return to New Orleans after an absence of fouror five months ; that the mother of the child remained at New Orleansin a state of slavery, but that Mrs. Slater brought the childwith her from New Orleans to Boston, having the child in hercustody as the agent and representative of her husband, whoseslave the child was, by the laws of Louisiana, when the child wasbrought thence ; the object, intent, and purpose of the said MarySlater being to have the said child accompany her, and remainin her custody, and under her care during her temporary absenceOF THE Emancipation OF SLAVES. 359from New Orleans, and that the said child should return with herto New Orleans, the domicil of herself and her husband ; that thesaid child was confided to the custody and care of said Aves byMrs. Slater, during her temporary absence in the country for herhealth. The respondent concludes by stating, that he has exercisedno other restraint over the liberty of this child than such aswas necessary to the health and safety of the child. Notice havingbeen given to Mr. and Mrs. Slater, an appearance has beenentered for them, and in this state of the case and of the parties,the cause has been heard. Some evidence was given at theformer hearing, but it does not materially vary the facts stated inthe return. The fact testified, which was considered most materialwas, the declared intent of Mrs. Slaver to take the child back toNew Orleans. But as that intent is distinctly avowed in the return,that is, to take the child back to New Orleans, if it could belawfully done, it does not essentially change the case made by thereturn.This return is now to be considered in the same aspect as ifmade by Mr. Slater. It is made in fact by Mr. Aves claiming thecustody of a slave in right of Mr. Slater, and that claim is sanctionedby Mr. Slater who appears by his attorney to maintain andenforce it. He claims to have the child as master, and carry herback to New Orleans ; and whether the claim has been made interms or not to hold and return her as a slave, that intent is manifest,and the argument has very properly placed the claim uponthat ground.The case presents an extremely interesting question, not somuch on account of any doubt or difficulty attending it, as onaccount of its important consequences to those who may be affectedby it, either as masters or slaves.The precise question presented by the claim of the respondentis, whether a citizen of any one of the United States, where negroslavery is established by law, coming into this state, for any temporarypurpose of business or pleasure, staying some time, but notacquiring a domicil here, who brings a slave with him as a personalattendant, may restrain such slave of his liberty during hiscontinuance here, and convey him out of this state on his return,against his consent. It is not contended that a master can exercisehere any other of the rights of a slave owner, than such as360 SLAVERY.may be necessary to retain the custody of the slave during his residence,and to remove him on his return.Until this discussion, 1 had supposed that there had been adjudgedcases on this subject in this commonwealth ; and it is believedto have been a prevalent opinion among lawyers, that if aslave is brought voluntarily and unnecessarily within the limits ofthis state, he becomes free, if he chooses to avail himself of the provisionsof our laws ; not so much because his coming within ourterritorial limits, breathing our air, or treading on our soil, worksany alteration in his status, or condition, as settled by the law ofhis domicil, as because by the operation of our laws, there is noauthority on the part of the master, either to restrain the slave ofhis liberty, whilst here, or forcibly to take him into custody inorder to his removal. There seems, however, to be no decidedcase on the subject reported.It is now to be considered as an established rule, that by theconstitution and laws of this commonwealth, before the adoptionof the constitution of the United States, in 1789, slavery was abolished,as being contrary to the principles of justice, and of nature,and repugnant to the provisions of the declaration of rights,which is a component part of the constitution of the state.It is not easy, without more time for historical research than Inow have, to show the course of slavery in Massachusetts. By avery early colonial ordinance, (1641,) it was ordered, that thereshould be no bond slavery, villeinage, or captivity amongst us,with the exception of lawful captives taken in just wars, or thosejudicially sentenced to servitude, as a punishment for crime. Andby an act a few years after, (1646) manifestly alluding to sometransaction then recent, the general court conceiving themselvesbound to bear witness against the heinous and crying sin of manstealing, &c., ordered that certain negroes be sent back to theirnative country (Guinea) at the charge of the country, with a letterfrom the governor expressive pf the indignation of the courtthereabouts. See Ancient Charters, &c. 52. chap. 12. sections2, 3.But notwithstanding these strong impressions in the acts of thecolonial government, slavery to a certain extent seems to havecrept in ; not probably by force of any law, for none such is foundor known to exist ; but rather it may be presumed, from that universalcustom, prevailing through the European colonies, in theOF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 361West Indies, and on the continent of America, and which was fosteredand encouraged by the commercial policy of the parentstates. That it was so established, is shown by this, that by severalprovincial acts passed at various times, in the early part of thelast century, slavery was recognized as existing in fact, and variousregulations were prescribed in reference to it. The act passedJune, 1703, imposed certain restrictions upon manumission, andsubjected the master to the relief and support of the slaves, notwithstandingsuch manumission, if the regulations were not compliedwith. The act of October, 1705, levied a duty, and imposedvarious restrictions upon the importation of negroes, and alloweda drawback upon any negro thus imported, and for whom the dutyhad been paid, if exported within the space of twelve months andbona fide sold in any other plantation.How, or by what act particularly, slavery was abolished in Massachusetts,whether by the adoption of the opinion in Sommersett scase, as a declaration and modification of the common law, or bythe declaration of independence, or by the constitution of 1780,it .is not now very easy to determine, and it is rather a matter ofcuriosity than of utility ; it being agreed on all hands that if notabolished before, it was so by the declaration of rights. In the caseof Winchendon v. Hatfield, 4 Mass. Rep. 123., which was a casebetween two towns respecting the support of a pauper, Chief JusticeParsons, in giving the opinion of the court, states, that of thefirst action which came before the court after the establishment ofthe constitution, the judges declared, that by virtue of the declarationof rights, slavery in this state was no more. And he mentionsanother case, Littleton v. Tuttle, 4 Mass R. 128., note, inwhich was stated as the unanimous opinion of the court, that anegro born within the state, before the constitution, Was bornfree, though born of a female slave. The chief justice, however,states, that the general practice and common usage have been opposedto this opinion.It has recently been stated as a fact, that there were judicialdecisions in this state prior to the adoption of the present constitution,holding that negroes born here of slave parents were free,A fact is stated in the above opinion of Chief Justice Parsons,which may account for this suggestion. He states, that severalnegroes, born in this country, of imported slaves, had demandedtheir freedom of their masters by suits of law, and obtained it by362 SLAVERY.a judgment of court. The defence of a master, he says, was faintlymade, for such was the temper of the times, that a restless, discontentedslave was worth little, and when his freedom was obtainedin a course of legal proceedings, his master was not holden forhis support, if he became poor. It is very probable, therefore,that this surmise is correct, and that records of judgment to thiseffect may be found ; but they would throw very little light onthe subject.Without pursuing this inquiry farther, it is sufficient for the purposesof the case before us, that by the constitution adopted in 1780,slavery was abolished in Massachusetts, upon the ground that it iscontrary to natural right and the plain principles of justice. Theterms of the first article of the declaration of rights are plain andexplicit: " All men are born free and equal, and have certainnatural, essential, and unalienable rights, among which are, theright of enjoying and defending their lives and liberties, that ofacquiring, possessing, and protecting property." It would be difficultto select words more precisely adapted to the abolition ofnegro slavery. According to the laws prevailing in all the stateswhere slavery is upheld, the child of a slave is not deemed to beborn free, a slave has no right to enjoy and defend his own liberty,or to acquire, possess, or protect property. That the description wasbroad enough in its terms to embrace negroes, and that it was intendedby the framers of the constitution to embrace them, is provedby the earliest contemporaneous construction, by an unbrokenseries of judicial decisions, and by a uniform practice from theadoption of the constitution to the present time. The whole tenorof our policy, of our legislation and jurisprudence, from that timeto the present, has been consistent with this construction, and withno other.Such being the general rule of law, it becomes necessary to inquirehow far it is modified or controlled in its operation ; either,1. By the law of other nations and states, as admitted by thecomity of nations to have a limited operation within a particularstate ; or2. By the constitution and laws of the United States.In considering the first, we may assume that the law of this stateis analogous to the law of England, in this respect; that whileslavery is considered as unlawful and inadmissible in both, andthis because contrary to natural right and to laws designed for theOF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 3C3security of personal liberty, yet in both, the existence of slaveryin other countries is recognized, and the claims of foreigners,growing out of that condition, are to a certain extent, respected*Almost the only reason assigned by Lord Mansfield in Sommersetts case was, that slavery is of such a nature that it is incapableof being introduced on any reasons moral or political, but only bypositive law ; and, it is so odious, that nothing can be suffered toreport it but positive law.The same doctrine is clearly stated in the full and able opinionof Marshall Ch. J., in the case of the Antelope. 10 Wheat. 120.He is speaking of the slave trade, but the remark itself shows thatit applies to the state of slavery. " That it is contrary to the lawof nature will scarcely be denied. That every man has a naturalright to the fruits of his own labor is generally admitted, and thatno other pe.>:on can rightfully deprive him of those fruits, and appropriatethem against his will, seems to be the necessary resultof the admission."But although slavery and the slave trade are deemed contraryto natural right, yet it is settled by the judicial decisions of thiscountry and of England, that it is not contrary to the law of nations.The authorities are cited in the case of the Antelope, andthat case is itself an authority directly in point. The consequenceis, that each independent community, in its intercourse with everyother, is bound to act on the principle, that such other country hasafull and perfect authority to make such laws for the governmentof its own objects, as its own judgment shall dictate, and its ownconscience approve, provided, the same are consistent with the lawof nations ; and no independent community has any right to interferewith the acts or conduct of another state, within the territoriesof such state, or on the high seas, which each has an equalright to use and occupy ; and that each sovereign state, governedby its own laws, although competent and well authorized to makesuch laws as it may think most expedient to the extent of its ownterritorial limits, and for the government of its own subjects, yetbeyond those limits, and over those who are not her own subjects,has no authority to enforce her own laws, or to treat the laws ofother states as void, although contrary to its own views of morality.This view seems consistent with most of the leading cases on thesubject.Sommersett s case, 20 Bowels State Trials, 1., as already cited,3G4 SLAVERY.decides that slavery, being odious and against natural right, cannotexist, except by force of positive law. But it clearly admits,that it may exist by force of positive law. And it may be remarked,that by positive law in this connection, may be as well understoodcustomary law as the enactment of a statute ; and the wordis used to designate rules established by tacit acquiescence or bythe legislative act of any state, and which derive their force andauthority from such acquiescence or enactment, and not becausethey are the dictates of natural justice, and as such, of universalobligation.The Louis, 2 Dodson s Rep. 238. This was an elaborate opinionof Sir Wm. Scott. It was the case of a French vessel seized byan English vessel in time of peace, whilst engaged in the slavetrade. It proceeded upon the ground that a right of visitation bythe vessels of one nation, of the vessels of another, could only beexercised in time of war, or against pirates, and that the slavetrade was not piracy by the laws of nations, except against thoseby whose government it has been so declared by law or by treaty.And the vessel was delivered up.The Amadis, I Acton s Rep. 240. The judgment of Sir Wm.Grant in this case, upon the point on which the case was decided,that of the burden of proof, has been doubted. But upon thepoint now under discussion, he says, but we do not lay down as ageneral principle, that this is a trade which cannot, abstractedlyspeaking, be said to have a legitimate existence. I say abstractedlyspeaking, because we cannot legislate for other countries ;nor has this country a right to control any foreign legislature thatmay give permission to its subjects to prosecute this trade. Hehowever held, in consequence of the principles declared by theBritish government, that he was bound to hold, prima facie, thatthe traffic was unlawful, and threw on the claimant the burden ofproof, that the traffic was permitted by the law of his own country.The Diana, 1 Dodson, 95. This case strongly corroboratesthe general principle, that though the slave trade is contrary to theprinciples of justice and humanity, it cannot with truth be said,that it is contrary to the laws of all civilized nations ; and thatcourts will respect the property of persons engaged in it, underthe sanction of the laws of their own country.Two cases are cited from the decisions of courts of commonlaw, which throw much light upon the subject.OF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 365Madras v. Willis. 3 B. and Aid. 353. It was an actionbrought by a Spaniard against a British subject, who had unlawfullyand without justifiable cause, captured a ship with three hundredslaves on bord. The only question was the amount of damages.Abbott, Ch. J., who tried the cause, in reference to the verystrong language of the acts of parliament, declaring the traffic inslaves a violation of right, and contrary to the first principles ofjustice and humanity, doubted whether the owner could recoverdamages, in an English court of justice, for the value of theslaves as property, and directed the ship and the slaves to be separatelyvalued. On further consideration he and the whole courtwere of opinion, that the plaintiff was entitled to recover for thevalue of the slaves. That opinion went upon the ground that thetraffic in slaves, however wrong in itself, if prosecuted by a Spaniardbetween Spain and the coast of Africa, and if permitted bythe laws of Spain, and not restrained by treaty, could not be lawfullyinterrupted by a British subject on the high seas, the commonhighway of nations. And Mr. Justice Waylay, in his opinion,after stating the general rule that a foreigner is entitled, in a Britishcourt of justice, to compensation for a wrongful act, added,that although the language used by the statutes was very strong,yet it could only apply to British subjects. It is true, hefurther says, that if this were a trade contrary to the law ofnations, a foreigner could not maintain this action. And Best, J.spoke strongly to the same effect, adding that the statutes speakin just terms of indignation of the horrible traffic in human beings;but they speak only in the name of the British nation. If a shipbe acting contrary to the general law of nations, she is therebysubject to confiscation ; but it is impossible to say that the slavetrade is contrary to what may be called the common law of nations.Forbes v. Cochrane, 2 Barn. & Cress. 448 ; Scowl. & Ryl. 679.This case has been supposed to conflict with the one last cited ;but I apprehend, in considering the principles upon which theywere decided, they will be found to be perfectly reconcilable.The plaintiff a British subject, domiciled in East Florida, whereslavery was established by law, was the owner of a plantation andof certain slaves, who escaped thence and got on board a Britishship of war on the high seas. It was held, that he could not maintainan action against the master of the ship for harboring the slavesafter notice and demand of them. Some of the opinions given in366 SLAVERY.this case are extremely instructive and applicable to the present.Holroyd, J., in giving his opinion, said, that the plaintiff could notfound his claim to the slaves upon any general right, because bythe English laws such a right cannot be considered as warrantedby the general law of nature, that if the plaintiff could claim at all,it must be in virtue of some right, which he had acquired by thelaw of the country where he was domiciled, that when such rightsare recognized by law, they must be considered as founded, notupon the law of nature, but upon the particular law of that country,and must be co-extensive with the territories of that state ;that if such right were violated by a British subject, within suchterritory the party grieved would be entitled to a remedy; but thatthe law of slavery is a law in invitum, and when a party gets out ofthe territory where it prevails, and under the protection of anotherpower, without any wrongful act done by the party giving thatprotection, the right of the master, which founded on the municipallaw of the place only, does not continue. So in speaking ofthe effect of bringing a slave into England, he says, he ceases to beaslave in England, only because there is no law, which sanctionshis detention in slavery. Best, J., declared his opinion to the sameeffect. Slavery is a local law, therefore if a man wishes to preservehis slaves, let them attach them to him by affection, or makefast the bars of their prison, or rivet well ther chains, for the instantthey get beyond the limits where slavery is recognized by thelocal law, they have broken their chains they have escaped fromtheir prison, and are free.That slavery is a relation founded in force, not in right, existing,where it does exist, by force of positive law, and not recognized asfounded in natural right, is intimated by the definition of slavery inthe civil law : " Servetus est constitution juris gentium, qua quis dominionalieno contra naturam subjicitur."Upon a general review of the authorities, and upon an applicationof the well established principles upon this subject, we thinkthey fully maintain the point stated, that though slavery is contrary tonatural right, to the principles of justice, humanity, and soundpolicy, as we adopt them, and found our own laws upon them, yetnot being contrary to the laws of nations, if any other state orcommunity see fit to establish and continue slavery by law, so faras the legislative power of that country extends, we are bound totake notice of the existence of those laws, and we are not at libertyto declare and hold an act done within those limits, unlawfulOF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 367and void, upon our views of morality and policy, which the sovereignand legislative power of the place has pronounced to belawful. If, therefore, an unwarranted interference and wrong isdone by our citizens to a foreigner, acting under the sanction ofsuch laws, and within their proper limits, that is, within the locallimits of the power by whom they are thus established,, or on thehigh seas, which each and every nation has a right in common withallothers to occupy, our laws would no doubt afford a remedyagainst the wrong done. So, in pursuance of a well known maxim,that in the construction of contracts, the lex loci contractus shallgovern, if a person, having in other respects, a right to sue in ourcourts, shall bring an action against another, liable in other respectsto be sued in our courts, upon a contract made upon the subject ofslavery in a state where slavery is allowed by law, the law herewould give it effect. As if a note of hand made in New-Orleanswere sued on here, and the defence should be that it was on a badconsideration, or, without consideration, because given for the priceof a slave sold, it may well be admitted that such a defence couldnot prevail, because the contract was a legal one by the law of theplace where it was made.This view of the law applicable to slavery, marks strongly the distinctionbetween the relation of master and slave as established by thelocal law of particularities, and in virtue of that sovereign power andindependent authority, which each independent state concedes toevery other, and those natural and social relations which are everywhereand by all people recognized, and which, though they maybemodified and regulated by municipal law, are not founded uponit, such as the relation of parent and child, and husband and wife.Such, also, is the principle upon which the general right of propertyis founded, being in some form universally recognized as a naturalright, independently of municipal law.This affords an answer to the argument drawn from the maxim,that the right of personal property follows the person, and, therefore,where by the law of a place, a person there domiciled acquirespersonal property, by the comity of nations, the same mustbe deemed his property every where. It is obvious, that if thiswere true, in the extent in which the argument employs it, if slaveryexists any where, and if by the laws of any place a property canbe acquired in slaves, the law of slavery must extend to everyplace where such slaves may be carried. The maxim, therefore,and the argument can apply only to those commodities which are368 SLAVERY.every where, and by all nations, treated and deemed subjects ofproperty. But it is not speaking with strict accuracy to say, thata property can be acquired in human beings, by local laws. Eachstate may, for its own convenience, declare that slaves shall bedeemed property, and that the relations and laws of personal chattelsshall be deemed to apply to them ; as, for instance, that theymay be bought and sold, delivered, attached, levied upon, that trespasswill lie for an injury done to them, or trover for convertingthem. But it would be a perversion of terms to say, that suchlocal laws do in fact make them personal property generally ; theycan only determine, that the same rules of law shall apply to themas are applicable to property, and this effect will follow only so faras such laws proprio vigore can operate.The same doctrine is recognized in Louisiana. In the case ofLunsford v. Coquillon, 14 Martin s Rep. 404., it is thus stated:The relation of owner and slave in the states of this union, inwhich it has a legal existence, is a creature of the municipal law.See Story s Conflict of Laws, 92. 97.The same principle is declared by the court in Kentucky, in thecase ofRankinv. Lydia, 3 Marshall s Rep. 470. They say, slavery issanctioned by the laws of this state ; but we consider this as aright existing by positive law of a municipal character, withoutfoundation in the law of nature.The conclusion to which we come from this view of the law isthis :That by the general and now well established law of this Commonwealth,bond slavery cannot exist, because it is contrary tonatural right, and repugnant to numerous provisions of the constitutionand laws, designed to secure the liberty and personal rightsof all persons within its limits and entitled to the protection of thelaws.That though by the laws of a foreign state, meaning by " foreign"in this connection, a state governed by its own laws, and betweenwhich and our own, there is no dependence one upon the other,but which in this respect are as independent as foreign states, aperson may acquire a property in a slave, that such acquisition,being contrary to natural right, and effected by the moral law, isdependent upon such local law for its existence and efficacy, andbeing contrary to the fundamental laws of the state, such generalright of property cannot be exercised or recognized here.OF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 369That as a general rule, all persons coming within the limits of astate, become subject to all its municipal laws, civil and criminal,and entitled to the privileges which those laws confer ; that thisrule applies as well to blacks as whites, except in the case of fugitives,to be afterwards considered ; that if such persons have beenslaves, they become free, not so much because any alteration hasbeen made in their status, or condition, as because there is no lawwhich will warrant, but there are laws, if they choose to availthemselves of them, which prohibit their forcible detention or forcibleremoval.That the law arising from the comity of nations cannot apply ;because if it did, it would follow as a necessary consequence, thatall those persons who by force of local laws, and within all foreignplaces where slavery is permitted, have acquired slaves as property,might bring their slaves here, and exercise over them the rights andpower which an owner of property might exercise, and for anylength of time, short of acquiring a domicil ; that such an applicationof the law would be wholly repugnant to our laws, entirelyinconsistent with our policy and our fundamental principles, and istherefore inadmissible.Whether, if a slave voluntarily brought here, and with his ownconsent returning with his master, would resume his condition as aslave, is a question which was incidentally raised in the argument,but is one on which we are not called on to give an opinion inthis case, and we give none. From the principle above stated, onwhich a slave brought here becomes free, to wit, that he becomesentitled to the protection of our laws, and there is no law to warranthis forcible arrest and removal, it would seem to follow as anecessary conclusion, that if the slave waives the protection of thoselaws, and returns to the state where he is held as a slave, his conditionis not changed.In the case Ex parte Grace, 2 Haggard s Ad. R. 94., this questionwas fully considered by Sir Wm. Scott, in the case of a slavebrought from the West Indies to England, and afterwards voluntarilyreturning to the West Indies ; and he held that she was reinstatedin her condition of slavery.A different decision, I believe, has been made of the question insome of the United States ; but for the reasons already given, it isnot necessary to consider it further here.The question has thus far been considered as a general one,and applicable to cases of slaves brought from any foreign state or37Q SLAVERY.country ; and it now becomes necessary to consider how far thisresult differs, where the person is claimed as a slave by a citizen ofanother state of this Union, that is, how the question as betweencitizens of different states is affected by the provision of the constitutionand laws of United States.In Article 4. sec. 2., the constitution declares that no personheld to service or labor in one state, under the laws thereof, escapinginto another, shall in consequence of any law or regulationtherein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall bedelivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labormay be due.The law of congress made in pursuance of this article provides,that when any person held to labor in any of the United States, &c.shall escape into any other of the said states or territories, the personentitled, &c. is empowered to arrest the fugitive, and uponproof made that the person so seized under the law of the state,from which he or she fled, owes services, &c. Act of Feb. 12th,1793.In regard to these provisions, the court are of opinion, that asby the general law of this commonwealth, slavery cannot exist,and the rights and powers of slave owners cannot be exercisedtherein. The effect of this provision in the constitution and laws ofthe United States, is to limit and restrain the operations of thisgeneral rule, so far as it is done by the plain meaning and obviousintent and import of the language used, and no further. The constitutionand law manifestly refer to the case of a slave escapingfrom a state where he owes service or labor, into another state orterritory. He is termed a fugitive from labor ; the proof to bemade is, that he owed service or labor, under the laws of the stateor territory from which he fled, and the authority given is to removesuch fugitive to the state from which he fled. This language can,by no reasonable construction, be applied to the case of a slavewho has not fled from the state, but who has been brought intothis state by his master.The same conclusion will result from a consideration of thewell known circumstances under which this constitution wasformed. Before the adoption of the constitution the states were,to a certain extent, sovereign and independent, and were in a conditionto settle the terms upon which they would form a more perfectunion. It has been contended by some over-zealous philanthropists,that such an article in the constitution could be of noOF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 371binding force or validity 7 , because it was a stipulation contrary tonatural right. But it is difficult to perceive the force of this objection.It has already been shown, that slavery is not contrary tothe law of nations. It would then be the proper subject of treatiesamong sovereign and independent powers.Suppose instead of forming the present constitution, or any otherconfederation, the several states had become in all respects sovereignand independent, would it not have been competent for themto stipulate, that fugitive slaves should be mutually restored, andto frame suitable regulations, under which such a stipulation shouldbe carried into effect ? Such a stipulation would be highly importantand necessary to secure peace and harmony between adjoiningnations, and to prevent perpetual collisions and border wars. Itwould be no encroachment on the rights of the fugitive ; for nostranger has a just claim to the protection of a foreign state againstits will, especially where a claim to such protection would be likelyto involve the state in war ; and each independent state has a rightto determine by its own laws and treaties, who may come to resideor seek shelter within its limits. Now, the constitution of theUnited States partakes both of the nature of a treaty and of a formof government. It regards the states, to a certain extent, as sovereignand independent communities, with full power to make theirown laws, and regulate their domestic policy, and fixes the termsupon which their intercourse with each other shall be conducted.In respect to foreign relations, it regards the people of thestate as one community, and constitutes a form of governmentfor them. It is well known that when this constitution was formed,some of the states permitted slavery and the slave trade, and consideredthem highly essential to their interests, and that some otherstates had abolished slavery within their own limits, and from theprinciples deduced and policy avowed by them, might be presumedto desire to extend such abolition further. It was therefore manifestlythe intent and the object of one party to this compact toenlarge, extend and secure, as far as possible, the rights and powersof the owners of slaves, within their own limits, as well as in otherstates, and of the other party to limit and restrain them. Underthese circumstances the clause in question was agreed on and introducedinto the constitution ; and as it was well considered, as itwas intended to secure future peace and harmony, and to fix asprecisely as language could do it, the limit to which the rights ofone party should be exercised within the territory of the other, Itis to be presumed that they selected terms intended to express their372 SLAVERY.exact and their whole meaning ; and it would be a departure fromthe purpose and spirit of the compact to put any other constructionupon it than that to be derived from the plain and natural importof the language used. Besides, this construction of theprovision in the constitution gives to it a latitude sufficient to affordeffectual security to the owners of slaves. The states have aplenary power to make all laws necessary for the regulation ofslavery and the rights of slave owners, whilst the slaves remainwithin their territorial limits ; and it is only when they escape,without the consent of their owners, into other states, that theyrequire the aid of other states to enable them to regain their dominionover the fugitives.But this point is supported by most respectable and unexceptionableauthorities.In the case of Butler v. Hopper, 1 Wash. C. C. Rep. 499,, itwas held by Mr. Justice Washington, in terms, that the provisionin the constitution which we are now considering, does not extendto the case of a slave voluntarily carried by his master into anotherstate, and there leaving him under the protection of some law declaringhim free. In this case, however, the master claimed tohold the slave in virtue of a law of Pennsylvania, which permittedmembers of congress and sojourners, to retain their domesticslaves, and it was held that he did not bring himself within eitherbranch of the exception, because he had, for two years of the period,ceased to be a member of congress, and so lost the privilege ;and by having become a resident could not claim as a sojourner.The case is an authority to this point, that the claimant of a slave,to avail himself of the provisions of the constitution and laws of theUnited States, must bring himself within their plain and obviousmeaning, and they will not be extended by construction ; and thatthe clause in the constitution is confined to the case of a slave escapingfrom one state and fleeing to another.But in a more recent case, the point was decided by the sameeminent judge. Ex parte Simmons, 4 Wash. C. C. Rep. 396. Itwas an application for a certificate under 3 of the act of Feb. 12.1793. He held that both the constitution and laws of the UnitedStates apply only to fugitives, escaping from one state and fleeingto another, and not to the case of a slave voluntarily brought by hismaster.Another question was made in that case, whether the slave wasfree by the laws of Pennsylvania, which like our own in effect,OF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 373liberate slaves voluntarily brought within the state, but there is anexception in favor of members of congress, foreign ministers,consuls, and sojourners: but this provision is qualified as to sojournersand persons passing through the state in such a manner as toexclude them from the benefit of the exception, if the slave was retainedin the state longer than six months. The slave in that casehaving been detained in the state more than six months, wastherefore held free.This case is an authority to this point : The general rule being,that if a slave is brought into a state where the laws do not admitslavery, he will be held free, the person who claims him as a slave,under any exception or limitation of the general rule, must showclearly that the case is within such exception.The same principle was substantially decided by the state courtof the same state in the case of Commonwealth v. Holloway, 2 Serg.& Rale, 305. It was the case of a child of a fugitive slave, bornin Pennsylvania. It was held that the constitution of the U. Stateswas not inconsistent with the law of Pennsylvania ; that as the lawand constitution of the U. S. did not include the issue of fugitiveslaves in terms, it did not embrace them by construction or implication.The court considers the law as applying only to thosewho escape. Yet by the operation of the maxim which obtains inall the states wherein slavery is permitted by law, partus sequiturventrem, the offspring would follow the condition of the mother, ifeither the rule of comity contended for applied, or if the law ofthe United States would be extended by construction.The same decision has been made in Indiana, 3 AmericanJurist, 404.In Louisiana, it has been held, that if a person with a slave goesinto a state to reside where it is declared that slavery shall not exist,for ever so short a time, the slave, ipso facto, becomes free, and willbe so adjudged, and considered afterwards in all other states; anda person moving from Kentucky to Ohio, to reside, his slavesthereby became free, and were so held in Louisiana. This casealso fully recognizes the authority of states to make laws dissolvingthe relation of master and slave ; and considers the special limitationof the general power, by the federal constitution, as a forcibleimplication in proof of the existence of such general power.Lunsford v. Coquillon, 14 Martin s Rep. 465.And in the above cited case from Louisiana, it is very significantlyremarked, that such a construction of the constitution and374 SLAVERY.law of the United States can work injury to no one, for the principleacts only on the willing and violent nonsuit injuria.The same rule of construction is adopted in analogous cases inother countries, that is, where an institution is forbidden, but whereforspecial reasons, and to a limited extent, such prohibition is relaxed,the exemption is to be construed strictly, and whoever claimsthe exemption must show himself clearly within it, and wherethe facts do not bring the case within the exemption, the generalrule has its effect.By a general law of France, all persons inhabiting, or beingwithin the territorial limits of France, are free. An edict waspassed by Louis XIV. called c Le Code Noir, respecting slavery inthe colonies. In 1716, an edict was published by Louis XV. concerningslavery in the colonies, and reciting, among other things,that many of the colonists were desirous of bring ng their slavesinto France, to have them confirmed in the principles of religion,and to be instructed in various arts and handicrafts, from whichthe colonists would derive much benefit, on the return of the slaves,but that many of the colonists feared that their slaves would pretendto be free on their arrival in France, from which their ownerswould sustain considerable loss, and be deterred from pursuingan object at once so pious and useful. The edict then provides aseries of minute regulations to be observed both before their departurefrom the West Indies, and on their arrival in France, andif all these regulations are strictly complied with, the negroes sobrought over to France shall not thereby acquire any right to theirfreedom, but shall be compellable to return ; but if the ownersshall neglect to comply with the prescribed regulations the negroesshall become free, and the owners shall lose all property in them.20 Ho well s State Trials, 15, note.The constitution and laws of the United States, then, are confinedto cases of slaves escaping from other states and coming withinthe limits of this state without the consent and against the willof their masters, and cannot by any sound construction extend toa case where the slave does not escape and does not come withinthe limits of this state against the will of the master, but by his ownact and permission. This provision is to be construed accordingto its plain terms and import, and cannot be extended beyond this,and where the case is not that of an escape, the general rule shallhave its effect. It is upon these grounds, we are of opinion, thatOF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 375an owner of a slave in another state, where slavery is warrantedby law, voluntarily bringing such slave into this state, has no authorityto detain him against his will, or to carry him out of the stateagainst his consent, for the purpose of being held in slavery.This opinion is not to be considered as extending to a casewhere the owner of a fugitive slave having produced a certificateaccording to the law of the United States, is bonajide removing suchslave to his own domicil, and in so doing passes through a freestate ; where the law confers a right of favor, by necessary implication,it gives the means of executing it. Nor do we give anyopinion upon the case, where an owner of a slave in one state, isbona fide removing to another state where slavery is allowed, andin so doing necessarily .passes through a free state, or arrives by accidentor necessity he is compelled to touch or land therein, remainingno longer than necessary. Our geographical positionexempts us from the probable necessity of considering 1 such a case,and we give no opinion respecting it.The child who is the subject of this habeas corpus, being of tootender years to have any will, or give any consent to be removed,and her mother, being a slave and having no will of her own, andno power to act for the child, she is necessarily left in the custodyof the law. The respondent having claimed the custody of thechild in behalf of Mr. and Mrs. Slater, who claim the right tocarry her back to Louisiana, to be held in a state of slavery, weareof opinion that his custody is not to be deemed by the court aproper and lawful custody.Under a suggestion made in the outset of this inquiry, that aprobate guardian would probably be appointed, we shall for thepresent order the child into a temporary custody, to give time foran application to be made to the judge of probate.3.BUTLER et a], v.

GRIFFITH. Oct. T. 1823. 2 Pick. Mass.Rep. 11.A slave be This was an indictment for an assault and battery and false imprisonment, committed on the body of a negro, named Randolph,Virginia i n the town of New Bedford. A trial was had upon the generalescaped in , .to this issue, and the allegations in the indictment were proved. Thede f enc e set up, and which also was proved, was, that Randolphit Was a shave > formerly the property of one M Carty, of the state ofwas held, Virginia, who was now deceased. Randolph having fled from hisStates service in his life time. It was in evidence, that Randolph camesto ^ ew Bedford four or five years ago, and that he had a dwellless. ling house there, which he had acquired and held as his own.

It was proved that by the laws of Virginia, the service of the slave upon thedecease of M Carty became due to Mason, the administrator ; butthe deceased also appeared, or was admitted, that by the laws of Massacresth e e Ta g w setts, Randolph did not owe service to any one ; and farther, thatno letters of administration had been granted upon the estate ofto whom M Carty within this commonwealth.

Virginia, as above mentioned, by himself, his agent, or attorney, toreclaim tic s ^ ave > or that the letter of attorney was not sufficientOF Time EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 377to operate in Massachusetts, then the verdict should stand ; otherwisethat the defendant should be discharged.Parker, Ch. J., delivered the opinion of a majority of the court,in substance as follows. The first question is, whether the defendantwas duly empowered as an agent to reclaim the slave. We donot decide whether a scroll is a seal, though probably it wouldnot be so considered in this state. But we think that a letter ofattorney was not required to communicate power to this agent.In general, a seal is not necessary, except to authorize the makingof a sealed instrument. A common letter, or a parol authority,is sufficient for making many important contracts. The wordsof the statute are, " the person to whom such labor or service maybedue, his agent, or attorney." If a letter of attorney were required,the statute would have used the word attorney only; but theword agent being used, serves to explain the intention of the legislature.The question then is, whether Mason, having been dulyappointed administrator under the laws of Virginia, had a right tocome here himself and claim the slave ; for the claim by his agentwas the same as if made by himself. It has been decided, that aforeign administrator cannot come here to collect a debt ; and if itwas necessary to pursue the slave in the character of administrator,the authorities are clear against the defendant. But by the statuteof the United States, the person to whom the service is due., mayreclaim, and by the laws of Virginia an administrator is such person.Taking both together, Mason might come here to reclaim ;and it was not necessary that he should come in the character ofan administrator* This brings the case to a single point, whetherthe statute of the United States giving power to seize a slave withouta warrant is constitutional. It is difficult in a case like this, forpersons who are not inhabitants of slave holding states, to preventprejudice from having too strong an effect on their minds. Wemust reflect, however, that the constitution was made with somestates in which it would not occur to the mind to inquire whetherslaves were , property. It was a very serious question, when theycame to make the constitution, what should be done with theirslaves. They might have kept aloof from the constitution. Thatinstrument was a compromise. It was a compact by which all arebound. We are to consider, then, what was the intention of theconstitution. The words of it were used out of delicacy, so as notto offend some in the convention whose feelings were abhorrentto slavery ; but we there entered into an agreement that slaves378 SLAVERY.should be considered as property. Slavery would still have continuedif no constitution had been made. The constitution doesnot prescribe the mode of reclaiming a slave, but leaves it to bedetermined by congress. It is very clear, that it was not intendedthat application should be made to the executive authority of thestate. It is said that the act which congress has passed on thissubject, is contrary to the amendment of the constitution, securingthe people in their persons and property against seizures, &c.without a complaint upon oath. But all the parts of the instrumentare to be taken together. It is very obvious, that slaves arenot parties to the constitution, and the amendment has relation tothe parties.But it is said, that when a seizure is made, it should be madeconformably to our laws. This does not follow from the constitution,and the act of congress says, that the person to whom theservice is due, may seize, &c. Whether the statute is a harsh one,is not for us to determine. But it is objected, that a person mayin this summary manner seize a freeman. It may be so ; but thiswould be attended with mischievous consequences to the personmaking the seizure, and a habeas corpus would lie to obtain the releaseof the person seized. We de not perceive that the statute isunconstitutional, and we think the defence is well made out.5.MURRAY, a pauper, v. Marty.

Code, vol. 1. p. 186., the privilege of bringing slavesinto this commonwealth can be claimed by those persons only, whoat the time of their removal, were citizens, not of this, but of someother state ; and as it is admitted that the appellee was a native ofthis state, and has not laid aside that character, the judgment mustbe reversed. Aud Judges Roanee and Fleming concurred.6.BARNETT v. SAM. April T. 1821. 1 Gilmer s Virginia Rep. 232.This was a suit for freedom, in forma pauperis, by Sam.

The son, who was agent for thefather, and the father were the importers of the slaves. Both intendedto become, and did become citizens of Virginia, by whichthe law was satisfied ; its policy being to exclude slaves generally,but to admit them when brought by persons removing from anotherstate and becoming citizens. Either the son or the father mighttake the oath. Judgment affirmed.8.GOMEZ v. BONNEVAL. June T. 1819. 6 Martin s LouisianaRep. 656.Per Cur. Derbigny, J. The petitioner is a negro in actualbecome state of slavery ; he claims his freedom, and is bound to prove it.bangles l n hi g attempt, however, to show that he was free before he wasgaily im introduced in this country, he has failed : so that his claim nowported intothe state, rests entirely on the laws prohibiting the introduction of slaves inthe United States. That the plaintiff was imported since that prohibitiondoes exist, is a fact sufficiently established by the evidence.What right he has acquired under the laws forbidding such importationis the only question which we have to examine. Formerly,while the act dividing Louisiana into two territories was in force inthis country, slaves introduced here in contravention to it, were freedby operation of law ; but that act was merged in the legislative provisions,which were subsequently enacted on the subject of importationof slaves into the United States generally. Under the now existinglaws, the individuals thus imported acquire no personal rights :OF THE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 3Slthey are mere passive beings, who are disposed of, according tothe will of the different state legislatures. In this country, theyare to remain slaves, and to be sold for the benefit of the state.The plaintiff, therefore, has nothing to claim as a freeman ; andas to a mere change of master, should such be his wish, he cannotbe listened to in a court of justice.9.LINK v.

Hitchcock, 2 Johns. Cas. 79.,) so as toemancipate the slave.

It was admitted, that he was born of aslave mother ; that his mother s owner has ever resided, and stillresides, in New Orleans ; that he is twenty-seven or twenty-eightyears of age ; that he has enjoyed his freedom for fourteen years,and been married as a freeman.On these facts, it is clear, he was born a slave, and must continueso, unless he was emancipated ; as he is under the age ofthirty years, and the lawful emancipation of a slave cannot takeplace before that age, the presumption of a legal emancipation,which might result from his long possession of his freedom, is repelledfrom the evident impossibility his legal emancipation havingtaken place and the legal impossibility of a slave becomingfree without a legal emancipation. Prescription <?an no more availhim, than it would the possessor of property evidently out of commerce.Judgment affirmed.NOTE. It will be seen by this chapter that the owner of slavesmay emancipate them by deed, will, or by a contract executed.But to this benevolence of the owner there are, in the most of thestates, restraints upon the exercise of this power by the owner.Slaves are recognized wherever the system is tolerated as property,and are subject to all the rules in the acquisition, possession,and transmission of property. It would seem, therefore, upon afirst view of the case, that the owner should do with his propertywhatever he pleased, and should have the privilege of renouncinghis right to it whenever he pleased, and without being qualifiedby any public laws or regulations upon the subject. Such, hoofTHE EMANCIPATION OF SLAVES. 387ever, is not the fact ; restraints upon this right exist in nearly allthe states.By the Rev. Stat. of Missouri, p. 587., any person may emancipatehis or her slave, by last will, or other instrument in writing,under hand and seal attested by two witnesses, and proved andacknowledged in the circuit court of the county where the partyresides ; but there is a saving as to creditors of debts prior to theact of emancipation. And provision is made to compel the emancipatorto support the emancipated slave, where in the judgmentof the court he was of unsound mind, or above forty-five years ofage, or under twenty-one, or if a female, under eighteen years.By the revised code of Virginia, vol. 1. p. 432., slaves may beemancipated by last will and testament, or writing, under hand andseal, attested and proved in the county or corporation court bytwo witnesses, or acknowledged by the party in the court of thecounty where he or she resides, to emancipate or set free, his orher slaves, or any of them who shall thereupon be entirely andfully discharged from the performance of any contract enteredinto during servitude. But the slaves emancipated are madeliable for the previous debts of the owner.Emancipation is guarded in Tennessee by a provision, (statuteof 1777,) that the state must assent, or the act of manumission bydeed or will is ineffectual, and as it appears, Fisher v. Dabbs, 6Yerger s Rep. 119., the emancipated slave must be immediatelyremoved beyond the limits of the United States.By the statute law of Alabama, Aikens Dig. 647., slaves maybeemancipated by the master, on application to the county court,and on proof of meritorious services ; but the slave must removeout of the limits of the state. And the rights of creditors arepreserved. Similar provisions are to be found in the other states.1 Rev. Code of Virginia, p. 436. ; Rev. Code of Mississippi, p.385., &c.When it is considered that slaves are a peculiar species of property,it will not excite surprise that laws are necessary for theirregulation, and to protect society from even the benevolence ofslave owners, in throwing among the community a great numberof stupid, ignorant, and vicious persons, to disturb its peace, andto endanger its permanency.The right of society to regulate and control the ownership ofthis kind of property may be justified on the same grounds as388 SLAVERY.some other species of property. No one can doubt the right ofindividuals to acquire, possess, and sell gun powder. But if thepossessor chooses to take it to his house or store, in a city or populoustown, the public become interested, and will restrain himwithin reasonable and proper limits. In New York, Philadelphia,Baltimore, and other populous places, this property, as anarticle of commerce, is regulated (as to the quantity to be kept inthe city,) by the public laws. And the constitutionally of thoselaws cannot be doubted. So of slaves. The owner may keep asmany as he pleases, but if he emancipates them, and turns themloose upon society, they have a right to protect themselves againsthis improvidence, or even his benevolence and generosity. Theyhave a right to declare the act illegal or to restrain it within suchbounds as shall secure their safety.(XX.) OF SUITS FOR FREEDOM*(A) OF THE ACTION.1.MIMA QUEEN AND CHILD v. HEPBURN. Feb.

The defendant pleaded theincapacity of the plaintiff to stand in court, as she was the slave,not of the testator, but of another. The parish court gave judgment,that " the plaintiff be maintained in her right to institutethis suit ; that she be declared entitled to obtain her freedom ; and,to this end, that the defendant in this cause be compelled to purchasethe plaintiff and her child, as agreed upon by her master,and emancipate them, agreeably to the last will and testament ofErasmus R. Avaro, of whom he is executor. And further, thathe pay the costs of the suit." From this judgment the defendantappealed.Per Cur. Martin, J. This action is grounded on the regulationsin our civil code which relate to slaves, and particularly thatpart of them which authorizes them to be parties in civil actions,either as plaintiffs or defendants, when they have to claim or provetheir freedom.The defendant denies the plaintiff s right to sue, because, by herown showing in the petition, she is indisputably the slave of anotherperson, and does not claim freedom directly against the defendant.As she is not opposed by her acknowledged master, we are ofopinion that she has a right to maintain her action. But the parishcourt has erred in deciding definitively in favor of her right to freedom.It is therefore ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that thejudgment be annulled, avoided, and reversed, and that the case besent back with instructions to the judge to hear the parties and decidethe case, after an investigation of its merits.6.HARRIS v.

WRIGHTS. Nov. T. 1806. 1 Hen. and Munf. 334.Onus pro Appeal from the high court of chancery. The complainantswho rf met n in their bill asserted their right to freedom, as having descendedlies - in the maternal line from a free Indian woman, called ButteredNan. On the hearing, the chancellor perceiving, from his ownview, that the youngest of the claimants was perfectly white, andthat there were gradual shades of difference of color between thegrandmother, mother, and granddaughter, (all of whom where beforethe court,) and considering the evidence in the cause, determinedthat they were entitled to their freedom ; and, moreover, onthe ground that freedom was a birth-right, it was a general principle,that whenever one person claims to hold another in slaveryOF SUItS FOR Freedom. 393the onus poland lies on the claimant ; and he decreed in favorof the claimants.Per Cur. Tucker, J. In aid of the other evidence the chancellordecided upon his own view. This with the principles laiddown in the decree has been loudly complained of. Nature hasstamped upon the African and his descendants two characteristicmarks, besides the difference of complexion, which often remainvisible long after the characteristic distinction of color either disappearsor becomes doubtful : a flat nose and woolly head of hair.The latter of these characteristics disappears the last of all. Andso strong an ingredient in the African constitution is this lattercharacter, that it predominates uniformly where the party is inequal degree descended from parents of different complexions,whether whites or Indians, giving to the jet black hair of Indiansa degree of flexure which never fails to betray that the party distinguishedby it cannot trace his liege purely from the race ofnative Americans. Its operation is still more powerful where themixture happens between persons descended equally from Europeansand African parents. So pointed is this distinction betweennatives of Africa and the aborigines of America, that a manmight as easily mistake the glossy jetty clothing of an Americanbear for the wool of a black sheep, as the hair of an American Indianfor that of an African. Upon these distinctions, as connectedwith our laws, the burden of proof depends. Upon these distinctionsnot unfrequently does the evidence given upon trials of suchquestions depend, as in the present case, where the witnesses concurin assigning the hair of Hannah, the daughter of ButteredNan, the long straight black hair of the native aborigines of thiscountry. That such evidence is both admissible and proper, Icannot doubt. That it may sometimes be necessary for a judge todecide upon his own view, I think the following case will evince;Suppose three persons ; a black or mulatto man or woman witha flat nose and woolly head ; a copper-colored, with long jettyblack straight hair ; and one with a fair complexion, brown hair,not woolly, or inclining thereto, with a prominent Roman nose,were brought together before a judge on a habeas corpus, on theground of false imprisonment and detention in slavery; that theonly evidence the person detaining them in his custody could producewas an authenticated bill of sale from another person, and thatthe parties themselves were unable to produce any other evidence894 SLAVERY.concerning themselves, whence they came, &c. How must a judgeact in such a case? I answer, he must judge from his own view.He must discharge the white person and the Indian out of custody,taking surety, if the circumstances of the case should appear torequire it, that they should not depart the state within a reasonabletime, that the holder may have an opportunity of assertingand proving them to be lineally descended in the maternal linefrom a female African slave ; and he must redeliver the black ormulatto person with the flat nose and woolly hair to the personclaiming to hold him or her as a slave, unless the black personor mulatto could procure some person to be bound for him to produceproof of his descent, in the maternal line, from a free femaleancestor. But if no such caution should be required on either side,but the whole case left to the judge, he must deliver the farmerout of custody, and permit the latter to remain in slavery, until hecould produce proof of his right to freedom. This case may showhow far the onus grobandi may be shifted from one party to theother.5.Huggins v. WRIGHTS. Nov. T. 1896. 1 Hen. & Munf. Rep. 134,The onus, Per Cur. Tucker, J.

PHEBE, a woman of color. Jan. T. 1827. Martin& Yerger s Tennessee Rep. 1.Phebe sued Vaughan, in the court below, in an action of tres Reputeand false imprisonment. Vaughan pleaded that Phebe was a hears isslave, and his property. To which plea Phebe replied, denying admissibleshe was a slave, and the property of Vaughan. Upon which re of descentT j from indicationissue was joined. tian an ^At the trial of the cause in the court below, the plaintiff offered a ^^ a beto read in evidence, the depositions of Seth R. Pool, Martha used as aJones, and Phebe Tucker. The defendant, by his counsel, ob claJmo fjested to the competency of the evidence contained in Poole sdeposition, and to so much of Martha Jones and Phebe Tucker s freedom *as related to hearsay and information from others. The evidenceof Pool, as set out in his deposition is, " that he had been acquaintedwith Phebe for fifty years, and that she was always said to be ofIndian extraction. That he was also acquainted with her mother,called BecJ^ who was also called an Indian by descent ; and hebelieves she was the daughter of Moll, the property of Wm. Jones.That Phebe had been deprived of her eye by a ringworm. That Beck,396 SLAVERY.her mother, was sister to Tab, the property of Benjamin Tucker whohad always claimed her freedom, and as he believed had got her freedomby due course of law. That said Phebe is descended from anIndian mother, and was always considered free. That said Benjaminor Littlebury Tucker was sued by Tab, the maternal aunt ofPhebe, and sister to Beck ; and she recovered her freedom in consequenceof her having descended from an Indian mother, who wasfree. That he had often heard that Murcne was the grandmotherof Beck and Tab, and that she, Murene, was remarkably old, andlived about with her children and grand-children, and was alwaysreputed an Indian, and was free. That Murene was a coppercolor, and that Abner, the brother of Phebe, sued, as he was informedand believed, Thomas Hardeway for his freedom, and waskilled by said Hardeway ; and that Phebe had often solicited himto undertake to procure her freedom ; but from the long acquaintancehe had with her master he would not do it." Those partsof the depositions of Martha Jones and Phebe Tucker objected toare, "that they knew many years ago, a colored woman namedPhebe, in the possession of Thomas Hardeway of Dinwiddiecounty, Virginia ; she having lost an eye, as was said, by a tetteror ringworm. They also knew Phebe s mother, who was namedBeck. Beck was always said to be sister to Tab, by the mother sside. That they had understood that Phebe was brought to Tennesseeby Abraham Vaughan. That Tab had obtained her freedomby due course of law, and that they believed all Phebe s relationsin those parts had also obtained their freedom upon theplea of their having descended from an Indian ancestor. Theyalways understood that Molly Moore, (formerly Evans,) had oneof the family named Minor, and several others who had since allgot their freedom, as will appear of record.Per Cur. Crab, J. The defendant in error brought a suitagainst the plaintiff in error, in trespass. The plaintiff in errorpleaded, that Phebe was a slave, and his property. Whether she wasfree or a slave was the question. The cause was tried before a circuitjudge in Sumner county, and a verdict returned by the juryfor Phebe. A judgment was entered, "that the plaintiff recoveragainst the defendant her freedom and the damages," &c. Vaughanprayed an appeal, in the nature of a writ of error, to this court.At the trial, Vaughan, by his counsel, objected to the reading ofthe depositions of Seth P. Pool, and so much of those of MarthaOF SUITS FOR FREEDOM. 397Jones and Phebe Tucker, as related to hearsay, or informationfrom others. Some of us have had much difficulty in coming toa conclusion satisfactory to our minds as to some of the pointsmade in this cause. The peculiar value of the right claimed, andthe improbability of such a right being successfully asserted inmany instances, except by such evidence as that which has beenresorted to on this occasion, on the one hand ; and on the other, thewant of entire coincidence between what has been heretofore doneby judicial tribunals, whose decisions are precedents for this, andwhat we are now asked to do, added to the imposing character oftwo decisions, both of which, and one especially, would seem tomilitate against the introduction of the evidence received in thecourt below, have been the causes of that difficulty. To the argumentsmade, the decided cases produced on both sides, and someothers, a laborious and anxious examination has been given. Itonly remains for us to make known some of the considerationsthat have influenced us, and to announce the result to which wehave been conducted, in the best exercise of judgment of whichwe are capable. We shall not undertake to remark in detail uponeither the books or the arguments relied on at the bar. What thecircuit said, as to the effect of the evidence, or the purposes forwhich it was received, or what other testimony was brought forwardto support the verdict, does not appear. The questions are,therefore, simply as to the admissibility of the depositions, and theverdict and judgment for any legal purpose. Let the first questionbe, did the court below err by admitting the depositions 1That so much of them as relates to pedigree is legal evidence,was admitted by the counsel for Vaughan in argument.This is certainly a matter of long standing, such as those wherecourts " from necessity, and on account of the great difficulty ofproving remote facts in the ordinary manner by living witnesses,"have been in the habit of receiving hearsay and reputation as topedigree. And I suppose the proof has been made by the bestprocurable witnesses, taking into view the lapse of time, the removalof the plaintiff below into this from another and distant government,and other circumstances. Such proof is generally expectedfrom members of the family whose genealogy is in question, orothers, who from their situation, would be likely to possess the requisiteknowledge. A brief examination will manifest, that muchmore of the offered evidence is covered by the established rule inrelation to pedigree, than the counsel for Vaughan seemed to SLAVERY.pose. Take the question of pedigree to be simply a question fromwhat ancestors an individual derived his birth ; which is a muchmore confined arid limited sense than is often practically appliedto it. Suppose that Phebe, instead of alleging, as she does in thiscase, that she is descended from, or, in the language of the witness,has her extraction from a long line of Indian ancestors, had assumedthe position, that she was descended from a maternal greatgrandmother, named A. B., she could not prove this by hearsay,or reputation, after having first established the freedom of A. B.,or with the intention of afterwards establishing it? No one willdeny that she could. Why can she not with equal propriety showin the same manner, that she is maternally descended from theIndians of America, after having first shown, or intending otherwiseto demonstrate, that those Indians were either all free, or thatthey were at least prima facie to be presumed free 1 It may behere remarked, that if Phebe be shown to be descended fromIndian ancestors in the maternal line, all doubt will cease as to herbeing at least prima facie free. Had the residence of her ancestorsalways been in this state, we apprehend the fact of suchdescent would be conclusive evidence of her freedom.But her ancestors came, or were brought into Virginia, and theplaintiff below lived in that government until she was some yearssince brought here. The court of appeals of that state, who mustbe presumed to have construed their own statutes aright, say,(Hudgins v. Wrights, 1 Hen. & Munf. Rep. 139.,) that the act of assemblyof Virginia of 1691 repealed the acts of 1679 and 1682.And we heartily concur with them in the opinion, that, although anIndian taken into Virginia, between 1679 and 1691, might be aslave, yet " all American Indians, and their descendants, arepiimafacie free, and that where the fact of their nativity and descent, inamaternal line, is satisfactorily established, the burthen of proofthereafter lies upon the party claiming to hold them as slaves."Let us return to the doctrine of hearsay evidence, in cases of pedigree: hearsay or reputation, under the rule with regard to pedigree,is not confined to the fact of descent from a specified ancestor,or a tribe or nation of ancestors. It may be received to showthe truth of another fact, from which such descent can be reasonablyinferred. " Thus," says a popular writer on evidence,(Phillip s Ev. 168.) " declarations of deceased members of the familyare admissible evidence to prove relationship : as who wasOF SUITS FOR FREEDOM. 399a person s grandfather, or whom he married, or how many childrenhe had, or as to the time ot a marriage, or of the birth of achild, and the like, of which it cannot be reasonably presumed thatbetter evidence is to be procured." See Bull. N. P. 294.; 3. Starkies Evidence, 1113. From this examination it appears to us clear,that the circuit court did not err in admitting those parts of thedepositions which speak of any of the persons where genealogy isin question, having been called of Indian extraction, " called ofIndian descent," &c., which is tantamount to saying, they werecommonly reputed to be descended from the Indians, &c. &c. So,also, that the court did not err in receiving the hearsay as to Mu-renebeing reputed an Indian, &c.But these depositions contain statements of the common reputationin the state of Virginia, that some of the persons whose freedomwere in question were free. And hence arises the most difficultand embarrassing question : whether, when it becomes necessaryto inquire into occurrences of a remote period, common reputationis admissible to prove the right of freedom ? From thenature of the remedy provided, and for a long time sanctioned forthe enforcement of the right of freedom, there must necessarilyoften be inquiries into the transactions of remote periods. Thisremedy, as is well known, is the action of trespass. Whenevernecessary to bring suit, there has of course been a continuation ofthe trespass up to the time or near the time of commencing it. Theact of limitations would consequently be no bar. Hence results thenecessity of often introducing proof of a kind that would be unusualand unnecessary in ordinary cases. And partly from this cause, thiscase is assimilated to cases which have been allowed an exemptionfrom the strict rule prohibiting all sorts of hearsay evidence. It maybeadded, without our intending to give an opinion either way, asto the correctness of the position, that very respectable judges havemaintained the broad position, without allusion to the form of action,that length of time does not bar the right of freedom in thesame way, and to the same extent, as in other cases. See JudgeRacine s opinion, in Hudgins v. Wrights, ubi supra.How is an individual in this county, who is unfortunate enoughto have a woolly head and a colored skin, to prove that he is free 1Not being white, nor copper colored, nor having straight hair anda prominent nose, the presumption probably is, that he is a slave.See Hudgins v. Wrights, ubi supra. Contrary to the general rule,400 SLAVERY.he who Is charged with having trespassed upon his person, pleadsan affirmative plea, and yet need not prove it. He says, in justificationof his trespass, that the plaintiff is a slave ; and yet, on thatplaintiff is devolved the onus probandi to show himself a freeman.How is he to show it ? He may, perhaps, procure testimony thathe, or some ancestor, was for some time in the enjoyment of freedom; that he has acted as a freeman ; that he has been receivedas a freeman into society ; and very soon will find himself underthe necessity of increasing in proportion to the distance he has totravel into time past, for want of other evidence, to use hearsay ;that he, or his ancestor was commonly called a freeman, or commonlyreputed a freeman, or, in other words, evidence of commonreputation. And why should he not 1 Is it a concern of so littlemoment, that the law in its benignity ought to refuse those aids forits support and protection that have been so exuberantly extendedin analogous cases 1 Is it of less importance than the right ofdigging stone upon the waste of the lord of the manor 1 Moor-woodv.

Or to a modus, by which sixpencean acre more should be paid in lieu of small tithes 1 Haywoodv. Sims, Wright s Ex. Rep. 112. These are a few out of manycases. But it is said these rights, franchises, c., which inEngland are permitted to be established by hearsay, or common reputation,are, or savor of a public character ; and therefore thepublic, where this reputation is to be formed, will be more apt to possessa knowledge of their existence, &c. We put it to the candidand the enlightened, whether the right to freedom has not in this respectvery much the advantage over many of those rights wheresuch evidence is every day received in the English courts? Indeed,it is no light matter to be a freeman in these United States.Freedom in this country is not a mere name a cheat with whichthe few gull the many. It is something substantial. It embraceswithin its comprehensive grasp, all the useful rights of man ; andit makes itself manifest by many privileges, immunities, externalpublic acts. It is not confined in its operations to privacy, or tothe domestic circle. It walks abroad in its operations transfersits possessor, even if he be black, or mulatto, or copper colored,from the kitchen and the cotton field, to the court house and theOF SUITS FOR FREEDOM. 401election ground, makes him talk of magna charta and the constitution; in some states renders him a politician brings him acquaintedwith the leading citizens busieshimself in the political canvassfor office takes him to the ballot box ; and, above all, securesto him the enviable and inestimable privilege of trial by jury. Canit be said, that there is nothing of a public nature in a right, thatthus, from its necessary operation, places a man in many respectson an equality with the richest, and the greatest, and the best in theland, and brings him in contact with the whole community ]Can it be said, that common reputation is no evidence of a rightproducing so many effects relative in their character, to that verysociety where the common understanding, report, or reputation, isrequired to exist. Can it be said, that the community or neighborhood,as the case may be, the "public" around a man will tooreadily give credence to a claim, by which the individual whomakes it, obtains among themselves so high a comparative elevation] If those around him have interest or prejudice, they willusually be against his claim. It is difficult to suppose a case wherecommon reputation would concede to a man the right of freedom,if his right were a groundless one. If such a case be imagined, itwill most probably be an extreme one; and we must bear in mind,that when the evidence we are speaking of is received, it is not regardedas conclusive ; it is to be weighed, encountered, and comparedwith other evidence ; and ultimately to have no more effectthan, after full examination, the jury shall be disposed to give it.I cannot see how dangerous consequences are likely to result fromits admission. Slavery, in our sense of the word, is not known inEngland. Such a right of franchise, therefore, as an exemptionfrom slavery existing around them, has no place there, and ruleswith regard to it are unknown to their code. The right to freedom,in this relation, as well as the mode of proceeding for its assertion,is of American growth. Courts cannot be expected toshut their eyes on this important circumstance. Let not gentlemenobject, that prescriptive rights are regarded as null in England,or, at farthest, not more than prima facie good, unless theyhave had existence time whereof the memory of man is not to thecontrary, and unless the claimant can bring himself within thestrict rule as to recent enjoyment ; and that, therefore, we oughtnot to liken the right of freedom to them, as we cannot preservethe parallel throughout. We must ask them to recollect, that wearenot relying on cases as to prescription, &c., as precedents in this402 SLAVERY.cause, but that we are endeavoring by analogy to ascertain what isthe rule in a new case, in a new sort of ac ion, as to a new sort ofright. Nullus simile est idem; or, in the language of the supremecourt of the United States, in the case of Nicholls and Webb, weareendeavoring to " adapt the rule of evidence to the actual conditionof men," believing that in this sense it must " expand accordingto the exigencies of society." Common reputation maybeproved in cases of custom, prescription, &c. It must be reputationas to the right, privilege, franchise, &c., claimed, and nothearsay evidence as to any particular fact from which the right, &c.,might, be inferred ; contrary to what is certainly the rule in casesof pedigree and boundary. They stand in this respect upon differentgrounds. Peake s Ev. 13. As in cases of the former kind,it has been said, so I would say in the instance before us, you mayprove the right to freedom by common reputation as to the existenceof the general right. But you may not introduce any evidenceof hearsay, or reputation, as to any particular fact.The right to freedom is believed not to be a particular fact inthe sense in which the latter expression is used in the books. Itconsists in the exercise and enjoyment of multifarious exemptions,privileges, and rights. In its exercise and enjoyment it producesmany particular facts. So far as the cases, produced in Cranch andWheaton, vary from the above principle, if they do so, they havenot the approbation of our judgments ; and we must dissent fromthem. The cases cited from Washington, Henning & Unfold sReports, go strongly to support the view we have taken of the subject; and we concur with the reasoning of the court in thosecases. While, however, we place much reliance on the cases decidedin Virginia, we are by no means prepared to subscribe tothe correctness of the doctrine urged with earnestness on the partof the defendant in error : that the decisions of the court of Virginia,as they are binding, and demonstrate what the law is there,must be binding here also, this right to freedom having had itsorigin in that state, and the plaintiff below having had her domicilresidence there until lately. Counsel say she would be declaredfree there ; and, therefore, should be free here.It is apprehended, that this would be carrying the doctrine ofcomity between the judicial tribunals of independent states andempires farther than it has ever yet been extended, under the influenceof the rules of international law, or the peculiar provisions ofOF SUITS FOR FREEDOM. 403our federal constitution. True it is, that the decisions of the Virginiacourts, as to the proper construction of their own statutes,would be unquestioned by any tribunal in any other government.Elmendorf v. Taylor, 10 Wheat. Rep, 159. ; 6 do., 119. ; 5Cranch s Rep. 234 ; 4 do., 428. And so it would be as to theirdecisions with regard to real property situated there ; the universalrule being, that courts are to be governed, as to that sort ofproperty, by the lex loci rei since.

It is equally true, and very notorious too, that contracts are generallyto be under < od and given effect to, agreeably to the lawof the country where made. But it is conceived, that the questionhere is not within the governance of any one of the foregoingprinciples. To say that Phebe was free in Virginia, is beggingthe question. They certainly have no statute which pronouncesher free. Whether free or not, would depend upon the findingof a jury as to the fact of freedom. The difficulty is, as to whatevidence shall be received to show that she is free; as to what isthe true mode of ascertaining facts of a certain character. Andthat is to be determined by the rules of common law, modifiedand applied to the actual condition of men and things in thiscountry. On such a subject, courts in Virginia judge for themselves; and courts here are bound to exercise and pronouncetheir own judgments. There is another point of view in which toplace this subject. No doubt the most of the proof in controversyis admissible to show pedigree. Is not the whole of it ? Whenyou offer evidence of reputation, as to whether a person at a remoteperiod was free, are you not endeavoring to show that hewas descended from free ancestors ? Are you not showing hisdescent ? Are you not proving pedigree ? At all events, thenecessity for the evidence being equal, is not the principle thesame, requiring its introduction in both instances. So far, then,as the depositions have allusion to pedigree or common reputationas to freedom, we believe them to be competent evidence. Butthey contain some statements which are not considered admissible; and in receiving which, we think the court erred. We alludeto the evidence of several of the family having recovered their freedomby due course of law, &c. This ought to have been rejected.It would have been better proved by the records themselves. And it404 SLAVERY.is a maxim of the law of evidence, as true as it is trite, that the bestevidence which the nature of the case admits shall be produced.Upon the whole, we are all of opinion, that the following judgmentand directions be entered in this cause : Reverse the judgmentand remand it to the circuit court for a new trial, and rejectthe following words in Poole s deposition, " and that Abner, thebrother of Phebe, the plaintiff sued, as he is informed and believes,said Thomas Hardeway, and was killed by him." And to rejectthe following words in Martha Jones deposition: "Deponent believesall Phebe s relations in th se parts have also obtained theirs, onthe plea of their being descended from an Indian ancestor. Has alsounderstood, that one of the same family, named Minor, and severalothers, have since got free, as will appear of record ." And toreject the following words in Phebe Tucker s deposition. " Deponentbelieves all Phebe s relations in those parts got their freedomon the plea of their being descended from an Indian ancestor ; alwaysunderstood that Molly Moore had one of the family by thename of Minor, and several others, all of whom have obtainedtheir freedom upon the same plea." And to admit the residue ofsaid depositions, and also the verdict and judgment, with the proceedingsupon which they were founded, in evidence to the jury.10.JENKINS v. TOM. et al.

March T. 1836. 9 Louisiana Rep. 208.In a suit for freedom, the plaintiff, a black woman, alleged, that A statu H-she was born free in Pennsylvania, and that she is now held in p e nnsylva-slavery by the defendant. The defendant alleged, that he bought "j^ 8 ^the plaintiff by public or notarial act, &c. It appeared in evidence, age atthat the plaintiff was bound an indented servant in Philadelphia, to i s to beserve until she was 28 years of age, and that her master sold her, [[^be^eidand she was taken to Pittsburgh, and afterwards to Louisville ; and j n slaverywhere she was sold to others, and finally was bought by the de ana.fendant.The court observed : " There is no evidence that she was bornfree ; but the person in whose possession we first find her, heldher as a person indented to service till 28 years of age, which haselapsed. She was in like manner held as an indented servant byBakewell, Zuma, and Sutton, successively. She also resided withZuma in Ohio, a state where slavery never has existed. This fact,according to the principle to that effect established in the case ofForsyth et al. v. Nash, 4 Martin s Rep., would entitle the plaintiff toher liberty. If the plaintiff was an indented servant in the hands ofPage, Bakewell, Zuma, and Sutton, it is not seen how she couldafterwards become a slave. The plaintiff and her children are entitledto a decree for their freedom. The defendant appealed.By the court, Mathews, J. It is ordered, adjudged, and decreed,that the judgment of the district court be affirmed.406 SLAVERY.13.SCOTT v. WILLIAMS. June T. 1828. 1 Devereaux s North CarolinaRep. 376.In ties ^ le pl amain declared in trespass for an assault and battery andtions of false imprisonment ; the object of the suit being to ascertainfreedoms whether the plaintiff, a negro held in slavery by the defendant, wasSonTf^sla not in truth free On the tr * al ^ e P latin proved that he wasvery arises the son of Jemima, who was the daughter of Jane Scott ; and theblack com question was, whether Jane Scott was a free woman. Contra-butXl m> ne victory statements of her color were given ; but the plaintiff intro-fromthat duce an indenture whereby Jemima was bound to the father ofto.* the defendant, as a free girl of color. The plaintiff was given asaslave by the defendant s father to him, and resided with, andserved the defendant from the time of the gift to that of the trial.His honor, the judge below, instructed the jury, that the first questionfor them was, whether Jane Scott was a free woman. Andin ascertaining that fact, her color might enter into their consideration.If she was of a black African complexion, they might presume,from that fact, that she was a slave ; if she was of a yellowcomplexion, no presumption of slavery arose from her color. Thedefendant appealed.Per Cur. Hall, J. How far the charge of the judge in thiscase will admit of verbal criticism, is not my province to inquire ;but that it is plain and perspicuous, so as to be readily comprehendedby the jury, I think there can be but little doubt. They were toldthat they might consider whether Jane Scott was of a black complexion.If she was, they might presume from that fact that shewas a slave ; if she was of a yellow complexion, no presumptionof slavery could arise from her color. This part of the chargehas been found fault with in argument, because the jury were notinstructed that they must presume that Jane Scott was a slave, ifshe was of a black complexion. The judge, to be sure, in moreharsh dictatorial terms might have done so; but I think the differentis a general rule in all the states where slavery exists, that every negro is to bepresumed a slave. In addition to the cases abridged, Gibbons v. Morse, 2 Halst Rep.253 ; Davis v. Curry, 2 Bibb s Rep. 238. But this rule is qualified in North Carolina,and is confined to the black color, and does not extend to the mixed blood, mulattoes,vestiges, &c. Gobu v. Gobu, 1 Taylor s Rep. 164.; 2 Hayww. Rep. 170.See 2 Brevard s Dig. 235.; Mississippi Rev. Code 376.; Laws of Maryland, actof 1715.OF SUITS FOR FREEDOM. 407once would be verbal rather than substantial. When they weretold that no presumption could arise from a yellow complexion,they must have understood the judge to mean, that a presumptionof slavery must arise from a black one. I think there is nothingsolid in the objection.14.Maloney v. Ashton. Oct. T. 1797. 4 Har. & M Hen.

The ground on which the complainant claimed her freedom ^^m^vfwas, that she was descended from an Indian, who had been import hence therecord ofed in this country under such circumstances as would not justify the judg-herdetention in slavery ; and on which ground her mother Nanny ether Tul?had recovered her freedom of one Makes, her master. The ver in , [ favorJ ofthe mo-dictand judgment of the court in favor of Na my, the mother of therein athe plaintiff, was given in evidence. Verdict for the complainant, freedom,and the defendant appealed to this court.The court, Tucker, Roanee, and Fleming, J s., held, that the recordof the verdict and judgment upon a writ of inquiry, in a suit bythe mother of the plaintiff against a third person, in which recordthe ground of the judgment does not appear, may be given in evidenceto prove that the mother had recovered her freedom ; not thatshe was entitled to it "by reason of being descended in the maternalline from an Indian ancestor imported into this state since theyear 1705:" but the question on what ground the judgment in that408 SLAVERY.suit was rendered, and whether the defendant was born after themother acquired her right to freedom or not, ought to be left open.Per Tucker, J. How far a verdict inter alias is admissible, eitheras conclusive, or only as presumptive evidence in suits respecting freedom,I think may be shown by the following case : a female heldin slavery recovers her f-to m by judgment in the court of onecounty or district ; she removes to another county or district, withouta certificate of her freedom ; is taken up as a runaway ; advertisedand sold as such under the act concerning runaways. Shebrings another suit for her freedom against her new master. Canit be required of her to do more than to produce the former recordof her recovery, with an averment that she is the same person ?I conceive not ; and that such record is conclusive against all theworld, unless the judgment can be impeached by a person whosetitle was antecedent, to the recovery, on the ground of fraud andcollusion between herself and the defendant against whom she hadrecovered, or whose title was paramount to that of the defendant,and who would not have been barred by the act of limitations, if hehad brought an action of detinue for her as his slave. Now, let ussuppose, that at the time she was apprehended as a runaway, andsold, she had a child with her, who should also be sold as a slave,would it not be competent for this child to produce the record ofthe mother s recovery, and aver that she was born after the commencementof the suit, or the day of the writ purchased. Andif she proved this, would not the record be conclusive evidence in herfavor against all the world, except as before mentioned. And ifit would be conclusive evidence in that case, as I hold it would,could she not avail herself of that record as circumstantial evidence,to prove her right to freedom, under a prior right thereto, inher mother, if the child should happen to be born before, insteadof after the writ purchased in that suit ? I am decidedly of thatopinion also. For if the child be let in to prove the fact that hermother was a free woman by hearsay testimony, ought she not tobe let in to prove it by a judgment ? I am of opinion that the recordmaybe admitted as evidence ; that Nanny, one of the plaintiffsin that suit, was a free woman, or entitled to her freedom onthe day of the emanation of the writ in that suit ; leaving it opento both parties to show upon what ground that judgment was rendered; and also, whether the present plaintiff was born before orafter the emanation of the writ in that suit.OF SUITS FOR FREEDOM. 409(C.)

She was transferred to and from various persons, until j y holdingthe defendant brought her from a person claiming her as a slavefor life.The 28 years having expired, and the woman having been takento Ohio, where slavery is not tolerated, the court declaredher free. And as to the damages, they observed, " we think theyought not to be allowed against the defendant, or any of the waractors, except the vendor, who first violated their rights by sellingher as a slave for life ; he would be liable to vindictive damagesin a suit regularly brought for that purpose.

From the said 15thin slavery. J une , 1825, Until said day of April, 1827, the day on which thejudgment was rendered, the defendant continued to hold the plaintiffto labor as his slave. One of the questions in this case was,whether the plaintiff could maintain this action to recover damagesfor detention during the pendency of the original suit, and prior toits determination. It was agreed, that if, upon the facts, the courtshould be of opinion that the plaintiff should be entitled to recover,judgment should be entered for her for the sum of $20 per annum,for so long a time as the court should be of opinion the defendantwas liable.Per Cur. Catron, Ch. J. Can a person holden in slavery, butwho by a suit has established her right to freedom, bring a secondsuit to recover for profits produced by her labor to him who heldher as a slave ? Is the first suit, in which nominal damages wererecovered, an estoppel to a second recovery 1 Both the actionsare in trespass vi et armis. But the first for freedom tries the title,as an ejectment in cases of land ; slave or no slave, is the issue,which has never been holden in this state to involve the questionof hire. We borrowed the form of action from our sister states,especially Virginia, where the same rule of practice prevails.Pleasants v. Pleasants, 2 Call s Rep. 277. 293. 299. That theslave cannot sue the master, is a general rule. A suit for freedomtries the fact, whether the plaintiff is a slave.

But the judgment in the freedom suit will onlyrelate to its commencement, and estop the defendant to that time ;if wages and damages for previous time, and because of previousabuse are claimed, the controversy will again result in one of title.This is in analogy to the rent for mesne profits of land, in whichcase the recovery in ejectment is conclusive evidence of title fromand after the commencement of the action ; before the right hasnot been adjudged Bull.

Isabella, 2 Hen. & Muiif. 193.Nomine replegiando, brought by Susannahh Stokely against Alex A - udunder, to try the right of the plaintiff to the services of a negro ment ofgirl called Dance. The record of a judgment of the court, in a in favor ofcase where. Milleyy, the mother of Dance, was complainant, andMrs. Stokely defendant, and where the court found Milleyy a free * ive evidencea-person, and not a slave, was offered in evidence. The evidence gainst thewas objected to, and rejected by the court.Per Cur. Dance was born after her mother became a freewoman ; and the question is, whether Susannahh Stokely is estop of the,,, . . motherpea by this judgment from now averring contrary to the title thus born afterfound that Milleyy was her slave. I do not propose the question,412 SLAVERY.whether it is evidence to go to the jury, on the issue on trial, buton the ground of its exclusiveness. A recovery in any suit uponissue joined, on matter of title, is conclusive on the subject matter oftitle. An allegation on record, upon which issue has been oncetaken and found, is, between the parties taking it and their privies,conclusive according to the finding thereof, so as to estop the parties,respectively, from again litigating that fact once so tried andfound. Now, nothing can be clearer than this, that the childrenare privies in bl good to their mother ; and so far as it regardsthe state of the mother, whether a slave or free at the time of theirbirth, are privies in estate. It is unnecessary to decide, whetherchildren would be bound by judgment against their mother on aquestion of their freedom ; yet, even to support that doctrine, thereis very high authority.In the case of a child claiming to be free, because the mother inasuit wherein the same person was a party claiming the servicesof both, was adjudged free, on an allegation appearing on therecord precisely found that the mother was free when the childwas born, I can entertain no doubt but on principles of reason andauthority, the judgment is conclusive as to the freedom of the child-thefirst step the defendant must take, would be to prove, that themother was a slave ; partus sequitur ventrem. The child is bornfree according to the condition of the mother ; and if an actionwherein the person claiming the services of the child is one party,and the mother is the other party, she has been declared free by thejudgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, that matter cannotagain be called in question. The child with the record in hishand cannot be held in slavery or servitude. There is an end to thequestion as to the mother. The condition of the mother is changed,and it would shake our understandings, if the law were so that achild whose mother by law had been free before her birth should,notwithstanding, be born a servant or slave. In all personal actionsconcerning goods, chattels, and debts, a recovery in one action isa bar in another, and there is an end of the controversy. Coke sPreface to his Eighth Reports. The judgment, which is the fruitof the action concludes the existence of the right. If this child hadbeen born after the judgment in favor of the mother, it could not bepretended that the plaintiff below could retain her as a servant;yet this judgment has relation to the condition of the mother whenthe child was born, which has been conclusively settled to be thatof a free woman.OF SUITS FOR FREEDOM. 413The judgment is final for its own proper use and object ; andis conclusive on its subject, by way of bar to future litigation, forthe thing thereby decided. The judgment was on the very rightto hold the mother in slavery. That judgment was, that sheceased to be a slave long before the birth of this child. That wasthe immediate right in demand : the whole right of the plaintiff inthis action hung on that inquiry. She claimed by and through themother.Freedom or slavery of the mother was the substantial matter inissue in both suits. A case in the Year Book, 13th Ed. IV. 2, 3, 4,comes up to this. It was trespass for taking a villein. The ancestorof the villein had answered in a former suit, in which it had beenalleged, that he was a villein regardant ; that he was free, and notavillein in manner and form as alleged ; and it was so found. Theson of the supposed villein relied on this finding as an estoppel ;and it was held so.The court erred in not admitting this evidence. It was not onlyrelevant, but conclusive. Strictly speaking, as the former judgmentwas not pleaded, it may not be considered a legal estoppel ;yet it was conclusive, in evidence oil the right of these parties.VAUGHAN v. PHEBE, a woman of color. Jan. T. 1827. Martin& Yerger s Tennessee Rep. 1.Phebe sued Vaughan in the court below in an action of trespass Ajudg-and false imprisonment. Vaughan pleaded, that Phebe was a slave, JJJr^of 1 ?and his property. To which plea Phebe replied, denying she was freedom ofa slave, and the property of Vaughan. Upon which replicationissue was joined. At the trial in the court below, the plaintiff offeredto read to the jury the record of a verdict and judgment of heroes -,.

Did the court err by receiving the verdictand judgment in the suit of Tab and others v. Tucker? That was414 SLAVERY.a suit by Tab for her freedom. She obtained a judgment in herfavor on the ground that she was descended from Indian ancestors,as appears from the record. Tab was the maternal sister of Beck,who was the mother of Phebe. We think that hearsay evidence,that the maternal sister of one of Phebe s ancestors was alwaysreputed to have been descended from Indian ancestors, or that shewas reputed to be free, as having been descended from Indian ancestors,would be some evidence, in a case of pedigree, to showthat Phebe also was descended from the same. And, therefore,we consider the solemn verdict of a jury, upon proofs produced tothem many years ago, and with the judgment of the court uponit, full as good evidence, to say the least of it, of what was consideredthe truth in those days.We do not consider the question as to the introduction, for anypurpose of verdicts between others than parties and privies, as involvedin the determination of this case in any manner whatever.Nor is any opinion given as to the admissibility of judgments, exceptin the single case of a verdict and judgment offered, as hearsayevidence in a case of pedigree, as in the case before us. Sucha verdict and judgment was held to be admissible by the court ofappeals in Virginia, in Pegram v. Isabel, 2 Hen. & Munf. 193. ;and we believe properly.3.SYLVIA and Phillips, by next friend, v. COVEY.

The frame brought,of the action and principles of pleading forbid it. Detinue is a modeof action given for the recovery of a specific thing, and damages forits detention. Though judgment is rendered for the plaintiff for thealternate value, provided the thing cannot be had, yet the recoveryof the thing itself is the main object, and inducement to the allowanceof the action. The thing sued for has to be specifically describedin the writ, declaration, judgment, and execution, that itmay be distinguished from other things of the same species. Theaction is not adapted to the recovery alone of the value of thething detained ; nor can it be maintained therefor. The alternatejudgment for the value is but a mere incident to the judgment forthe thing ; nor can it be rightfully rendered, except where there isa judgment for the thing, from which it can result as an incidentor consequence. It would seem therefore, to be an indispensableconsequence, that there should be a thing sued for. A demandfor a dead slave does not fulfil the requirement.416 SLAVERY.3.SAUNDERS v. WOODS.

From this decision,complainant appealed to this court.Per Cur. Catron, Ch. J. The reasons why a court of equitydoes interfere to restrain an officer from selling the slave of onefor the debt of another, are stated in the case of Loftin v. Espyand Thomas, 4 Yerger s Rep. 84. ; and will not be repeated. Butto authorize the complainant to ask the interposition of the injunctionpowers of the court to restrain the sale, he must show clear,not to say undoubted title in himself. If the title is to be ascertainedby the complicated swearing of witnesses, as in this case, and theserelations of the respective parties, the court of chancery ought tosend the issue of title to a jury, where the witnesses may be seenand heard in person. Now, this might be attained by sendingdown an issue to be tried out of chancery, holding up the cause inthe mean time ; but there is an overruling objection to such course ;it would supercede the action of detinue to a great extent in allcases of the kind, and fill the courts of equity with the most harassinglitigation by way of experiment in advance of sending downthe issue. Every case would depend on its own circumstances,whether fit to be sent down ; and it is to be feared would presentlyresult in a general rule, with only occasional exceptions, to senddown all cases, in subversion of a tolerably well-settled practice,to bring detinue for the slave ; and if there was apprehension hemight not be had, file a bill to retain him during the progress ofthe suit at law ; a practice sanctioned in a case of trespass andfalse imprisonment for freedom at this term, in Covey v. Myrick .Where the right is, therefore, not clearly proved for complainant,OF THE ACTION TO RECOVER SLAVES. 417the bill must be dismissed ; which we think was correctly done inthis cause, although the complainant shows by his witnesses astrong case, and that it is highly probable he never did give theslave to his son. This proof, however, is much weakened by theevidence on the part of the defendant, making a fit case for a jury,and an unfit one, of course, to be tried by a chancellor.

JONES. June T. 1821. Gilmer s VirginiaRep. 341. ; CALDWELL v. FENWICK, 2 Danes Rep.333.; CARROL v, EARLY, 4 Bibb s Rep. 270.In detinue Austin s executor brought detinue against Jones, for severalthe jury negro slaves by name, and of specified value ; among them wasfound* for one called Beck. The defendant pleaded non detinet. There wastiff the 1 "" a verdict for the plaintiff; but the jury found also, that Beck, whoslave men was included in the first part of the verdict, died after suit brought,tioned,&c. .but that she and no damages were given. The court gave judgment lor all thesince the slaves but Beck ; of her, no mention was made in the judgment.The plaintiff appealed.the court Coalter, J. The appellant brought an action of detinue, in thenevertheless superior court of law for Hanover county, against the appellee,ment ^fbf" ^ or a ne o ro woman slave, named Beck, of the value of $400, andthe slave, f or her two sons, Paul, of the value of 400, and John, of the valuevalue ; the of $SOO. The jury found for the plaintiff the negro Beck, of thebeing put value of $475, Paul, of the value of $375, and John, of the valuein issue o f $300. They then proceed in these words : " We further findby pleapuisdarrein the said woman, Beck, has departed this life, since the institutionof this suit, to wit, during the present year." They do not findany damages for the detention of either of the slaves. The courtgave a judgment, in the usual form, for the negroes, Paul andJohn ; at the bottom of which judgment is this entry : " No judgmentbeing given for the negro woman named Beck in the declarationmentioned, or her value, the jury having found in their saidverdict that she has departed this life since the institution of thissuit, to wit, during the present year." To this judgment a supersedeaswas awarded.I, at first, was inclined to be of opinion, that the jury had a rightto find the slave Beck for the plaintiff, and to fix a nominal value,at least ; and although they had fixed a real value in their verdict,yet there being no motion for a new trial, on the ground that thevalue was too high, this court might presume it was well ascertained,because the defendant may have sold her for $475. Althoughdead, she might be considered as between these parties, to be ofthat value, and consequently, that the court could give judgmentfor her, so that the plaintiff might recover her value so ascertained.Had I been .confirmed in this opinion, then I should have beenfor reversing the judgment ; and would either have concurred inentering a judgment for Beck, of the value fixed by the jury, or IOF THE ACTION TO RECOVER SLAVES. 419would have sent the cause back, with liberty to the appellee tomove the court for a new trial ; in order that it might be seenwhether there was any such reason, as above supposed, for valuinga dead slave at $475. If 1 could have so sent it back, justice,I think, would have required me to do so ; not only because thisis a new case, unsettled by any of the courts, but because the jury,in the first part of the verdict, having found this slave for the plaintiffas though she was alive, may have thought it was their duty tovalue her, as if alive ; and I think it but right to presume, that nosuch reason, as above supposed, for assessing the value evenhigher than that laid in the declaration existed, because the courtrefuse to give judgment for that value, or to say any thing in relationto it which could induce such a supposition.I had at first doubted, whether it was not an error for the jury tofind a greater value than that laid in the declaration ; but I find itotherwise settled in Bigger s adm r v. Alderson, 1 Hen. & Munf.54. ; in which case the court also expressly says, the value is to befixed at the time of the verdict. Why ? Because the value may haveincreased, even beyond the plaintiff s own estimate when he sued ;in fact, the court there say, it is not important that the value shouldbe laid in the declaration, (I presume this is intended after verdict,)because the jury are to fix the real value at the time of the verdict.But if they are to give the plaintiff the increased value at that time,they cannot take an anterior date, so as to fix a greater value onthe defendant, when he cannot go back to an anterior date so asto establish a less value. On further reflection and consideration,however, I have come to the conclusion, that in the case of thedeath or destruction of the property, there can be no verdict orjudgment for the specific thing ; but that the regular course wouldbe for the jury, in responding to the whole issue, to find propertyin the plaintiff, and damages, if any, for the detention, and thedeath or destruction of the property since the suit, in order toshow why the value was not assessed ; and the judgment will beforthose damages only, and the costs. If great profits had beenreceived, either by a sale, great hires, or otherwise, by the defendant,I incline to think the jury might give damages for the detention,according to what the defendant had actually received ; butas to the value, the time of ascertaining it is correctly laid downin the case in this court above referred to ; and nothing could justifyfinding any value as to property dead or destroyed by actof God. Even in case of destruction by act of the party, the420 SLAVERY.jury can only give redress by way of damages for detention, or privationof property ; for they cannot say that property dead or destroyedis of any value. Suppose the slave had died five years beforethe verdict found, the suit having been pending a long time,and the jury were asked to assess hires, or damages, for the detentionto the date of the verdict ; could not the defendant show thatno such hires had been received, for that the negro was dead ?But say she was not dead, but that five years before the verdict shehad, by the visitation of God, become, and had remained so orsince a confirmed maniac, and a perpetual expense ; would fullhires according to her anterior value be given, down to the date ofthe verdict ? Could he not show this also as to her value ? or mustthe jury find her value as before that visitation ? We are not atliberty, nor are the jury, to speculate on the chances that she wouldnot have died, or been thus visited, had she not been detained fromthe plaintiff; or that he might have sold her, and laid his moneyout in other slaves, or lottery tickets, and thereby gained great profits.The whole injury which the law supposes the party to havesustained, down to the verdict, is the reasonable profits to thattime : he is to be retributed thus far, by way of damages for detention,and to recover back the property, or its value, at that time ;if the slave has grown up, and become very valuable at that time,then farther to detain, is doing an injury to that amount ; and if theproperty is not delivered up, the party is retributed for that value,or injury, by the judgmentIf she has become old and infirm, her hires have been diminishingfrom year to year, and her value now is $10, though it was anhundred when the suit was brought. Their hires down to the verdictretribute the party for the injury of detention, and the slaveor her then value compensates the whole injury.This is the injury complained of. The slave, or her value, isasked in the declaration, and given by the judgment ; and damagesfor the detention are also to be settled at the trial. The plea putsthese matters, as well as the title of the plaintiff, in issue. If thetitle only is found for him, the verdict is not sufficient to authorizea judgment in the case, unless it also appears by the verdict thatthe value could not be assessed. It is as necessary so to assess thevalue, and damages for detention, as to assess damages in assumpsit,where the plea of non assumpsit denies, as well the whole debt asthe particular amount of damages claimed. The value and damagesare equally within the issue in this case ; and evidence is asOF THE ACTION TO RECOVER SLAVES. 421necessary to ascertain them to the jury, as to prove the same duein assumpsit ; and the defendant is equally entitled to show thatthey are less than claimed, in this case as in that. The plaintiffproves the value of the slave, or the value of her labor at onetime ; does this preclude the defendant from showing that she wasnot worth so much at that time 1 Surely not. Will he be deniedthe right of proving that she was worth less at a subsequent time,and before the verdict? Surely not: unless the plaintiff has theprivilege of fixing the time when she shall be valued ; but the lawcorrectly fixes that time at the date of the verdict. Suppose shehad not been dead at the time of the verdict, but both her armshad been amputated, could not the defendant give this in evidenceon the inquiry as to her value 1 But it may be said, the jury cannotfind that she is dead, for if so, they could give no value, andthis would be to abate the suit ; for if a plaintiff was to sue for aslave, and state in his declaration that she was dead, a demurrerwould lie. Admit the last proposition to be true, yet the death ofthe slave after the suit could not be pleaded in abatement or bar,any more than payment of an account, or any part of it, after anaction of assumpsit brought, or the delivery of property after detinue.The plaintiff will recover his costs, and also any damagesthe jury may assess, and such matter will come out on the generalissue which general issue involves, as before said, the just retributionto which the plaintiff is then entitled, under the claim in his declaration.But the verdict is for Beck, of the value of $475. If this valuehas been ascertained, as the law say sit should be, at the time of theverdict, on what principle could the jury find that though she wasdead, she was worth that sum 1 Is not such verdict, upon its face,manifestly repugnant and void 1 The action of detinue is littleused in England ; and we must be governed by general principlesand by analogy to the redress given for similar injuries ; and,also, by considering the rights of the defendant after judgment inthis particular action. It is laid down in one case, that in detinuefor charters, if the issue be upon the detinue, and it be found thatthe defendant hath burnt the charters, the judgment shallnot be for the charters, for it appears he cannot have them,but he shall recover the value of the land in damages.Rob. Ab. 607. ; Bac. Ab. title " Detinue," letter B. But the juryfound the non-existence of the thing sued for. Regularly, thejudgment must be for the thing sued for, if to be had ; if not, forthe value ; but as the verdict showed the thing was not in existence,422 SLAVERY.though by the act of the party which might have done injury tothe value of the land, yet no judgment could be entered for it. Thelaw will not do a vain thing. Here, also, and that too by the actof God, which prejudices no man, the thing no longer exists ; andyet I am asked to enter judgment for it. But the defendant hasaright to deliver the property, and is not bound to pay the value.1 More. Vade Mecum, 416. ; Kew. 646.If, then, we have a right to enter a judgment for a dead negro,he must have a right to deliver the corps, otherwise he is deprivedof the power thus to discharge himself. Surely he could not deliverthe corpse ; and yet that is the thing for which we mustgive judgment on this verdict. We cannot expunge that part ofthe verdict, though we may set it aside as repugnant, and grant anew trial. But trover will lie, although the property be dead, becausethe time of the conversion gives the date to which the actionrelates ; and the very conversion may cause the death of the property.Bac. Ab., Trover, D. E. The recovery in that actionamounts to a sale of the property at the time of the conversion, andvests the property in the defendant, lb., A. ; Straw. 1078., from thattime ; so that, if he has sold it even pending the suit, or before, andthe plaintiff never gets his damages, he cannot bring detinueagainst the purchaser. But in case of detinue, the property isnever transferred until the alternative value is received. It continuesthe property of the plaintiff at the time, and after judgment ;and therefore, in this case, if we can suppose property in a deadslave, she was the plaintiff s property at and after the judgment.She was certainly his property when she died. How then can shehave died the property of the defendant ? If she died the plaintiff sproperty, can the defendant be compelled to pay for her, as thoughshe were in full life, and thereby acquire title to her 1 Will the lawcompel him to purchase a dead slave at $475, when it will notcompel him to purchase her at that price if alive, but would allowhim to continue the property still in the plaintiff by delivering herto him ?So, too, in trover ; if the conversion consists altogether in arefusal to deliver on demand, and the thing is then dead, or hadbeen forcibly taken away from the defendant, no action will lie.Bac. Ab., Trover, B. G. 8. And even in trover the party maydischarge himself by the delivery of the property, and damageswill be assessed accordingly ; but this must be done at, or beforetrial, and by the assent of the court. If he cannot do this, heOF THE ACTION TO RECOVER SLAVES. 423must stand to the loss, as the conversion is the gist of the action.Esp. N. P. 596. The most I could do in this case would be toset aside the verdict as imperfect and repugnant on its face ; becauseit assesses a high value for a slave who is found to be dead ;with instruction to the court to direct the jury, that if they find propertyin the plaintiff, but that the slave is dead, they must find this lastfact specially ; and in that case, only find such damages for the detention,as the plaintiff may be entitled to according to the evidence.Brooke, J. The question in this case is, whether the finding ofthe jury, that the slave Beck died after the institution of the suit,is to deprive the plaintiff of his judgment for her value. A correctdecision of it will depend on an accurate view of the nature of theaction and the pleadings.The object of the action of detinue is, to recover the specificproperty detained, or its value, and damages for detention ; it. is, liketrover, an entire action. Judgment for the defendant is a good bar, inan action of trover, for the same thing. So, a judgment in trovergives the property to the defendant, and is a bar to an action ofdetinue. It is not denied, that the destruction of the propertybefore trial is no defence in the. latter action. In that action, thequestion is, to whom did the property belong at the time of theconversion 1 And its object is, to recover the value thereof indamages. The action of detinue is only a broader action ; substantially,it is the same, with the addition, that the specificproperty may be recovered, if to be had ; and if not, the alternativevalue and damages for detention. The alternative is given to meetthe accidents that may happen to the property ; which, in trover,would be an unavailing defence. The latter, in England, is mostfrequently resorted to, because of the wager of law, which woulddefeat the action of detinue. Under our law. that objection to theaction of detinue does not apply ; and it is a valuable remedy, particularlyin relation to property in slaves ; and would be abandoned,if the destruction of the property was to defeat it ; the action oftrover would be preferred. According to the form of the action ofdetinue, also, it cannot be maintained for the hire of the property,and damages for its detention only. In both actions, the value ofthe property must be recovered, or nothing. So, that in this case,if the death of the slave is to avail, the judgment must be for thedefendant as to her. No example can be shown, of a judgmentin detinue for a personal chattel in which value is omitted. Thecase from Roll of charters, has very little application. The action424 SLAVERY.for charters is a mixed action ; it partakes of the realty ; theremay be summons and severance. In detinue for a chattel, a capiaslieth ; not so for charters. Co. Litt. 286. But even in that case,"the judgment was for the value of the thing, which was substantiallythe object of the suit. In the absence of all direct precedent,therefore, I infer, even from that case, that no judgment can berendered in detinue, omitting the value of the property in controversy.An omission to find the value of the slave Beck, in thiscase, by the jury, would have rendered the verdict imperfect, andno judgment could have been given on it for hire and damages only.The finding, then, by the jury, that the slave Beck was dead, wasirrelevant to the issue ; otherwise, a verdict for hire and detentionof the property would be a perfect verdict, on the principle, thatwhatever a jury may find on a special verdict, they will be presumedto have found on a general verdict, if that verdict is questioned.So much for the nature of the action. The pleadings, generally,are the best texts of the law. The plea of now detinet traverses theallegations in the declaration, and puts it upon the plaintiff to provethem.As to the possession in the defendant, that need only be proved,either at the suing out of the writ, or at some time before. In thecase of Darnley, v. Lambert, 1 Wash. Rep. 308., that was the decisionof this court. That decision excludes any other period; itis not incumbent on the plaintiff to prove possession in the defendantat any after period. Having proved property in himself, andpossession in the defendant at or before suing out his writ, andvalue, the proof of the plaintiff is complete ; and it follows, that anynegative proof by the defendant, as to the possession after thewrit, would be improper.But it is contended, that proof of the death of the slave relates tothe value, and not to the possession. Is it correct to say, thatproof of the non-existence of the thing is proof of its value ? Valueis a question of plus or minus. The inquiry presupposes theexistence of the property, and possession in the defendant. Itgoes to show, that he was not in the possession of the slave Beckat the time of the trial ; that is, that he was not in a condition todeliver her to the plaintiff, which is interdicted by the decision beforereferred to. The plea relates to the time of suing out thewrit, or to some previous period as regards the possession, andnot to a time subsequent, according to that decision. Proof, therefore,that the defendant had lost the possession, by death or otherTHE ACTION TO RECOVER SLAVES. 425wise, at a later period, was irrelevant to the issue ; and the jury havingfound the fact, that finding is mere surplusage : the rule beingthat utile per inutile non vitiate. For these reasons, I think the judgmenterroneous ; that it ought to he reversed, and that judgmentshould be rendered for the value of the slave who died after theaction was commenced.Roanee, J. This was an action of detinue, brought by the appellant,in the superior court, to recover three negroes, stated to beof separate and specified values. Among them is the negro Beck,stated in the declaration to he of the value of $400. The damagesare laid at $1200. Issue was joined on the plea of non detinet.In September 1817, the jury found "for the plaintiff, the negroBeck, of the value of $475," and the two other negroes at specifiedvalues ; but find no damages. They further find, that thenegro Beck died " since the institution of this suit," to wit, duringthe present year. The judgment in the superior court was, thatthe plaintiff recover the other two negroes, of the values respectivelyfound, if to be had ; and if not, their respective values. Nojudgment being given for Beck, or her value, the jury havingfound, that she died since the institution of the suit, in the presentyear. From this judgment the appellant obtained a supersedeasto this court; and the question now is, whether the judgmentaforesaid, as it omits to give a judgment for the negro Beck, becorrect or not. That judgment, as to her, can only be justified,by taking the date of the finding, and not that of the institution ofthe suit, as the criterion, as well in relation to the right of propertyitself, as to settling its alternate value. This question is to be decidedas upon the present pleadings. I shall enter, therefore, intono inquiry, whether the action will lie for a negro that is dead, atthe time of the institution of the suit ; or for one dying after the institutionof the suit ; and respecting which, the jury are permittedby the pleadings (if there be such a case) to inquire into that fact,as at such posterior time, and at the date of the verdict. In orderto simplify this case, too, 1 will consider this action as having beenbrought only for the negro Beck. There can be no difference inprinciple between that case and the one before us.It is a general principle of law, that the evidence, the pleadings,and the verdict, all have reference to the time of instituting the suit.Thus, as to the evidence, it was held in 1 Munf. Rep. 22., (Harrisonv. Rocks,) that an award made after the institution of the suitwas not permitted to be given in evidence on the plea of SLAVERY.summit. As to the pleadings, it was held, in the case of Smith v.Walker, 1 Wash. Rep. 135., that the pleas the act of limitations washad, for referring to the time of the plea, instead of that of the institutionof the suit. And a similar plea was held to be bad, and issuejoined thereupon immaterial in the case of Henderson v. Light-foot,1 Call s Rep. 241. As to the verdict, the case of Burnley v.Lambert, 1 Wash. Rep. 308., is more than an authority. It not onlynegatives the idea that the verdict relates to the time of its rendition,but asserts that it has relation, as to the possession, to a timeanterior to that of the institution of the action, namely, to the daymentioned in the declaration. It, therefore, goes beyond the pointthat I have occasion to contend for in the present instance, namely,that of the institution of the suit, and is a full and pointed authority.Mr. Marshall, as counsel for the appellee in that case, whilehe admitted, that if the property should perish, or be disposed of,after the action was brought, the plaintiff might recover the alternativevalue, (which could not be the alternative value, as at thetime of rendering the verdict,) contended, that the time of the institutionof the action, and not a prior time, formed the criterionas to the proof of possession. He contended for this on the groundthat the plea and declaration were in the present tense, and thereforerelated to the time of the institution of the suit. The courtoverruled this argument, by saying, that it proved too much ; thatit would equally prove that possession must be shown to be in thedefendant, not only at the time of issuing the writ, but also at thatof rendering the verdict. This decision, therefore, is a clear authority,that notwithstanding the verdict may also use words in thepresent tense, they do not justify an inquiry into the fact of possessionas at that time, but relate to the time put in issue by the pleadings.This idea is farther corroborated by several cases in this court.In the cases of Newby s Adm r v. Blakey, 3 Hen. & Munf. 57 ;and Elam v. Bass Ex rs, 4 Munf. Rep. 301. ; it was held, that adefendant may protect himself on the plea of non detinet, by proofof five years possession of the negroes before the emanation of thewrit. If a plaintiff lies by, without bringing a suit, for more thanfive years, he is not permitted to recover ; and the five years vestsa title in the defendant. But this inference would be very unjustin relation to a plaintiff who has committed no laches ; but, on thecontrary, has brought his suit within one month after he lost thepossession, merely because the time of rendering the verdict wasprotracted, by the delays of the court and the management of theOF THE ACTION TO RECOVER SLAVES. 427defendant, to a longer period than five years from the inception ofthe defendant s possession. These principles, and these cases,then, clearly prove that the jury were limited by the pleadings, inthis case, to the proof of a possession, as at the time of the institutionof the suit, and had no right to receive evidence, or find averdict, touching the non-existence of that possession, as at thetime of rendering the verdict. That was a point ulterior to theone made by the pleadings. It was not in issue, and therefore itwas irregular to offer evidence in relation to it, or find it by the verdict.If the plaintiff could have foreseen from the pleadings thatsuch evidence would have been offered, he might have repelledthat evidence, and the result might, as to the actual death of thenegro, have been entirely different. We can, therefore, not knowthis fact in this case, and are to decide the case as if it were not inthe record. That fact is, in truth, not before us, which is precludedby the issue between the parties, and to which the evidence andverdict have been illegally and irregularly extended. We are also tobear in mind, that although the negro is emphatically found to bedead, it is but little more than finding, that she was not in the possessionor power of the defendant at the time of rendering the verdict.It is unimportant from what cause this want of possession proceeded,whether from the natural death of the subject sued for, or,for example, by wilful destruction of it by the defendant after theinstitution of the action. In the last case, it would scarcely becontended, that the defendant should avail himself of his wrong todefeat the plaintiff s action, if this fact were even found by a specialverdict.If this evidence, therefore, ought not to have been received, northe verdict extended to the present point, what is to be done in theactual case before us 1 The verdict in question is a general verdict,and not a special one. It is not a special one, because itsubmits no question of law to the decision of the court. It is notaspecial verdict, for the further reason, that a jury ought not tosubmit, in such a verdict, a matter which is not pertinent to theissue, and much less one which is entirely out of that issue. 7 Bac. 4.If the issue relates to the possession, as at the date of the writ, it isentirely foreign to that issue to inquire thereof as at the time offinding the verdict. This verdict, however, is not bad on accountof its finding ; also this matter, which is not in issue in the cause,after having found the negro in question " for the plaintiff." Thefinding of that which is within the issue* is not vitiated by finding428 SLAVERY.that which is not. In such cases utile per inutile non vitiate ; andthat which is not within the issue will be rejected as surplusage,the jury having nothing to do with it. 7 Bac. p. 26. Thus, in anaction of assumpsit against an executor, on a promise by his testator,and issue was taken on the plea of non assumpsit, the jury foundfor the plaintiff, but they likewise found that the testator was dealtbefore the day on which the promise was alleged to have beenmade. The verdict was held to be good, and the last part rejected,on the principle of its being surplusage, and not within the issue.7 Bac. 22. In principle, there is no difference between this caseand the one before us. Again, it is a rule, that if the jury findany thing, which is contrary to what is confessed in the pleadings,the verdict, as to so much, is bad, and it is to be rejected as surplusage; for the jury have nothing to do with what is confessed oradmitted by the pleadings. 7 Bac. 41. In the case before us,the pleadings are not only restricted to the date of the writ, as tothe fact of possession, but the existence of the subject seems admitted.On these pleadings the defendant may object, that he doesnot detain the negro, but that another man does ; or he may say,that he does not detain the plaintiff s negro, because she is hisproperty, and not that of the plaintiff. But on this issue, it couldnever for a moment be considered that the existence of the negrowas denied. If a tenant in dower pleads, that the demandantsdid not die seized of the premises, and issue is joined on that plea ;and the jury that he died seized, but further find, that the estatewas not liable to dower, the latter part of the verdict is bad, asfinding what is virtually confessed by the plea. 7 Bac. 41. Again,it is held that the plea of non cepit in replevin, confines the issue tothe taking, and allows the property to be in the plaintiff; and,therefore, no evidence shall be received, or verdict found on thisplea, to disprove the property of the plaintiff. 2 Esp. 11. So, indebt on a bond to perform an award made by J. S., the plea was,that J. S. made no such award, and issue ; the jury found J.S. made the award, but also found matter in avoidance thereof;the last part of the verdict was held to be bad, and was rejected,because it was contrary to the issue. 7 Bac. 41. These cases,by analogy, completely justify a rejection of the last part of theverdict before us, as being contrary to what is put in issue, and isadmitted by the pleadings.The decisions of this court completely show, that the verdicts ofjuries may be extended by the clerk from the general form in whichOF THE ACTION TO RECOVER SLAVES. 429they are found. This verdict, so extended, would be, that the defendantdoes detain the negro in question, and that she is of thevalue of $375. The subsequent finding of the fact, that she is dead,is clearly repugnant to such extended finding, and is to be rejected.By the first part of the verdict, the jury not only find the result infavor of the plaintiff, but find the fact also which justifies that result,and which is repugnant to, and overrules the latter finding. Thatcomplete finding by them, so compounded of law and fact, is notto be varied by any subsequent and irregular finding, on whichthey have erected no counter conclusion, nor authorized the courtto draw one. Such an authority can only be devolved on the courtby a special verdict. If this action were brought for this singlenegro, who had been for years withheld from the plaintiff, andwhose hires were considerable ; if on the ground in question, theright to the principal subject was defeated, that to the hires ordamages could not, I apprehend, be sustained ; and yet, this wouldbe a case of extreme hardship, as, at the time of the emanation ofthe writ, the right to both was perfect. The damages follow asincidental to the recovery, but cannot be obtained, in this action,without it. It has been argued, that you must receive this evidenceas at the time of the verdict, because that time is the criterion asto settling the alternative value. This has never been solemnly establishedby this court, nor would the inference clearly result fromit, if it had. In the case of Bigger s adm r v. Alderson, (1 Hen. &Munf. Rep. 54.,) Judge Warrington, indeed, gave this as his opinion,but the other judges were silent on the subject ; and the judgmentwhich was given in that case did not affirm this principle. For anythingappearing in that case, the value was settled at an anteriortime, and at the time of suing out the writ. As for the English decisions,they are so scanty on the action of detinue, that I can find inthem nothing decisive on this point. It is arguing in a circle to say,that unless this be the rule, the plaintiff would get too little for hisproperty. He would so, in relation to a subject of increasing value; but it may be retorted that he would get too much in relationto a subject of a contrary character ; and as to a subject of stablevalue, it is immaterial which rule is to prevail.If, however, this could be considered as the settled law, in relationto the alternative value, it does not follow that it would attractto it the principal inquiry relative to the possession of the subjectitself. It would not change the issue made up between the parties,430 SLAVERY.as to the right of the property, and which, in terms at least,also extends to the alternative value. In the case of judgmentfor the negro by default, or on demurrer, and a writ of injuryissued thereafter, to ascertain the value, if the time resorted to,as to the last, be that of the verdict, the time in relation to the firstis undoubtedly different ; it is, at least, that of suffering the judgment,if not that of the date of the writ. I apprehend, therefore,that the position in question is neither shown to be solemnly settled,nor would the inference contended for, clearly result from it, if itwere. As for the criterion now contended for, it would destroythe action of detinue altogether, in cases in which the suit is longprotracted, and the subject sued for is of a decaying and perishablenature. The ground taken, however, in this opinion, doesnot extend to cases in which the subsequent death of the negro isrelied on, by plea puis darrein continuance, or otherwise ; and inwhich the plaintiff had, consequently, an opportunity to contestthat point upon the evidence.If the criterion assumed by the last part of the verdict be sustainable,the plaintiff ought to have an opportunity to be heardupon it. I decide nothing, however, upon that point ; I only decideupon the actual case which is now before us, upon the pleadings.As long, therefore, as we are, in rendering our judgment,to respect the allegata and probata of the parties ; as long as weareto shut our eyes against facts which are not known to us uponthe pleadings, and are to reject impertinent matter which juriesmay put into their verdicts, we must decide this case for the appellant.We must so decide it, however the case might be, if,through the laches of the appellant, the slave had been permittedto die before his right had attached by bringing the action. Myopinion is, therefore, and such is the opinion of the court, that thejudgment of the superior court be reversed, and entered, also, forthe slave in question, if to be had, and if not, for her alternativevalue.EPPES v.

The only question was, whether the following circumstanceTHE ACTION TO RECOVER SLAVES. 431ces vested the title in the plaintiff, so as to prevent the defendant towards,from taking any thing under a subsequent sale to him by Johnson.The negro had been in possession of the plaintiff before the sale the Possessthe sheriff, and directly aft j r it returned to her house. A wit the pur-ness,introduced by the plaintiff, deposed, that before the sale Johnsonagreed to purchase the negro for the plaintiff; that after thattook place, the plaintiff offered to pay Johnson the price at which A, who deehad bought the slave, which he then declined receiving, request king it, buting her to keep it ; that at the time this offer was made, the plaintiffhad the money in her possession, but it was not produced in title: held,consequence of Johnson s wish that the plaintiff should retain it. r y wereUpon this point, the evidence was contradictory, and thereupon the J^^cledcounsel for the defendant moved the presiding judge to instruct the that the ys J might fromjury, that if Johnson purchased the slave at the request, and for these factsthe use of the plaintiff, as the slave was bid off and returned by thesheriff as purchased by him, the legal title vested in him, subject sale -only to a trust for the plaintiff, and that the matters deposed to bythe plaintiff s witness were not sufficient to vest that legal title inthe plaintiff; and further, that the legal title being in Johnson,could not be passed to the plaintiff without a written transfer, or asale accompanied with a delivery. But his honor refused to givethese instructions, and charged the jury, that if they believed thatJohnson purchased the slave at the request of, and as the agent ofthe plaintiff ; and delivered the negro to her as her property ; thatthe price bid by Johnson was tendered to him at the time of thedelivery, and was not paid because of his request ; or, if he wassatisfied with the plaintiff s promise to pay him the amount, theywere at liberty to find, that there was a valid sale by Johnson tothe plaintiff. A verdict was returned for the plaintiff, and the defendantappealed.Per Cur. Ruffin, J. I suppose the first instruction prayed onbehalf of the defendant to be correct, as far as respects the vestingof the legal title in Johnson, by the purchase in his own name,and his becoming responsible to the sheriff for the price, notwithstandingthe previous agency undertaken by him. If he chose toviolate his engagement, and to take the title to himself, he mightdo so. But if he did, that did not prevent a subsequent sale to theplaintiff, and that brings the question to the last part of that instruction,and to the next, as asked for : which is, that the evidence did432 SLAVERY.not establish a sale from Johnson, or that the legal title passed fromhim in any way. The court is of opinion that the jury might findthat it did. The possession of the slave was transferred to theplaintiff, who offered to pay an ascertained price, which Johnsonagreed to accept. It is true, the witness says, this was in referenceto the previous agreement of Johnson to buy the negro forthe plaintiff; and, therefore, there was then no proposition aboutthe price. But although the plaintiff claimed upon the score ofthe agency, because she did not know that the purchase had beenmade in Johnson s own name ; yet, when Johnson acquiesced in it,and made the plaintiff believe that she had thus the title in oneway, when, in fact, she was getting it in another, the plaintiffs mistake,as to the mode in which it passed, shall not prevent her fromacquiring it in any mode, if the acts then done, in their legal operation,passed the title of themselves.Did the plaintiff and Johnson then consider that the right to theslave was in the former, by virtue of what was before and thendone? Was every thing done, that was expected or intended tobe done, to vest the title in the plaintiff? and was this followed oraccompanied by actual delivery 1 If so it is a sale. It is an agreementthat the property is, or shall be another s, and that agreementconsummated by delivery. Suppose Mrs. Eppes had thenpaid the price, would any body doubt the character of the transaction1 Her agreement to pay is the same thing, if taken by theseller in place of the money ; and such the witness said was thefact. Upon the conflicting testimony, it was for the jury to determine.Taking that offered by the plaintiff to be true, there was acontract of sale, which accompanied by possession, is an executedcontract, and valid.

If there never had been any other law upon the subject,I should have said, that to entice a slave to leave his masterwas a taking and carrying away within the meaning of the act.With inanimate objects of larceny, force may be necessary, andmust be used ; but is there any thing in reason or common sense,which requires it as to those subjects of larceny which possess volitionand locomotion ?

At the same term he wasalso indicted for stealing one negro man slave, named EmanuelOF STEALING AND KIDNAPPING SLAVES. 437c., of the goods and chattels of one William B. Heath, &c. On trial andthis arraignment, he pleaded a former acquittal for the same offence,to which the state replied nul tiel record of a former acquittal ; andthe court doubting the law, referred the cause to this court, on a negrothe issue of nul tiel record. It appears by*" the record, that the {JJ^to"district attorney appeared to enter a nul pros, on the first indict s ^^ entment, and informed the prisoner and his counsel, that he consider tion fored that indictment invalid, and had preferred another ; and sub ne g ro manmitted to them, whether they would risk a trial on the first indict slavement ; whereupon the prisoner and his counsel would not move toquash the first indictment, but claimed a trial by jury ; a trial washad, and verdict for the defendant. I am of opinion that the firstindictment was insufficient to warrant a conviction, anil on whichno sentence could have been passed against the prisoner. Itcharges the prisoner with having stolen a negro man, no wherecalled a slave in the whole indictment ; and it is obvious that theattorney of the state aimed at an indictment, under the statute, forstealing a slave. The authorities summed up in in the first volumeof Chitty s Criminal Law, p. 453, &c., show clearly, that a convictionor acquittal on an invalid indictment cannot be pleaded inbar of a second, or subsequent prosecution. Wherefore, let judgmentbe entered for the state, on the issue joined on the plea ofauthor fois acquit ; and it is ordered, that the cause be remanded forfurther proceedings in the circuit court of said county of Pike.6.COMMONWEALTH v. PEAS. July T. 1834. 4 Leigh s Rep. 692.Indictment under the statute, 1 Rev.

PENALTIES FOR TRADING WITH, &c.1.Celery v. Hornet. Feb. T. 1822. 11 Martin s LouisianaRep. 4.It is no de Porter, J. This action was instituted in virtue of the 24th sensuiron iri the tion of the Black Code > ( l Marlin s Di S- 62 2.,) which enacts, thatpart of the " intoxicating liquors shall not be sold to slaves without a writtenCode, permission from their master ; and declares, that any person voidsC the f r Latin that P provision shall in cur a penalty; and, moreover, besale of spi answerable to the owner for all damages which the master mayquos to suffer in consequence thereof." The petition alleges, that the fendant di d, in violation of this law, sell to the slave, Jasmin, defendantvirtuous liquors ; that by the cause of them he became intoxicated :did notknow the and that in consequence of said intoxication, he was drowned. Thebe?*dave. defendant denied that he was liable, by reasons of the allegationsin the petition, arid concluded his answer by putting the plaintiff onthe strict proof of every thing necessary to support his action.There was judgment against him, and he appealed. The defencehas been presented to us in argument, under the following divisions1. That it is not proved that the illegal act complained of wasdone, knowingly, by the defendant.2. That the evidence does not prove that the slave became intoxicatedat the house of the defendant, and in consequence of thespirituous liquors he drank there.That the damages suffered by the master must be the direct andimmediate consequence of the intoxication of the slave, and that,in the present instance, the evidence does not establish that fact.1. The evidence proves clearly, that the defendant sold liquorto the slave of the plaintiff, and this is sufficient to throw theburthen of proof on the defendant, that the act was done innocently.Were we to require that the master, in an action of thisPENALTIES FOR TRADING WITH, &c, 439kind, should prove that the seller of liquor knew the individual towhom he sold it to was a slave, we would require evidence that,from the nature of the transaction it is impossible, in many cases,he could give, and defeat entirely the object of the statute. Thegeneral rule is, that the burthen of proof lies on the person whohas to support his case by proof of a fact, of which he is supposedto be cognisant. Phillip s Ev. (edit. 1820,) 150.2. The principal witness swears, that he embarked atthe markethouse in a pirogue, with the slave Jasmin and some other negroes;that they (the negroes) were sober when they set oft*; that whenthey came opposite the defendant s residence they put to shore,went into his house, purchased liquor, drank it, remained there aquarter of an hour, and that they began to quarrel and fight assoon as they re-embarked ; that Jasmin was drunk, and that ashort time after, he was drowned. This proof is satisfactory tomy mind, as it appears to have been to that of the judge who triedthe cause, that the intoxication of the slave proceeded from theliquors procured and drank at the defendant s shop. The thirdand last point is the only one which has presented any difficulty.The defendant insists, that the death of the slave was not the directconsequence of the intoxication ; but resulted from the act ofa third party threatening to flog him. On this head the evidenceis as follows : J. Soule, the witness who embarked in the piroguewith the slave Jasmin, swears, that after they left the shop of thedefendant, and embarked on board the pirogue, the negroes beganto quarrel, and finally to fight ; that one of them fell twice intothe river ; that he (the defendant) finding his situation a dangerousone, called for help from a boat he saw at some distance, andthat a Mr. Lartigue came to his assistance, and brought the pirogueto land. When they got on shore, Mr. Lartigue observed,that he would give them a flogging, and then they would behavethemselves. On hearing this, Jasmin jumped into the river, thewitness jumped after him, but was unable to save his life. Anotherof the negroes, who was also drunk, immediately endeavored todrown himself, but was prevented. Lartigue confirms this testimony,except that his declaration to the negroes was, that if theydid not behave themselves he would correct them.This evidence shows, in a most striking point of view, the consequencesthat result from violating a, wise and salutary law, whichis founded alike on a regard for the interests of the master andslave. And the judgment of this court can only enable the defendant440 SLAVERY.to discharge one of the responsibilities which he has incurred by thistransgression. The defence which he sets up cannot, in my opinion,be sustained. The bad conduct of the negroes in the boatwas the result of his act; the necessity of approaching Lartiguewas caused by it ; and the justifiable threat of correction arosefrom the intoxication of the slaves, which we have already seen,proceeded from a fault of the defendant. The case cited fromTaunton s Reports is not law here ; and the reasons given by thejudges who decided it are not satisfactory. It appears very strangethat a man should be excused from the consequences of illegallyfrightening the horse of a traveller, because the driver was not skilful,when it is clear there would not have existed a necessity for exercisingskill had it not been for the act of the defendant, and butfor that act, no damage would have been sustained. In the well-knowncase of the throwing of a squib, which was picked up andthrown by two other persons before it committed the injury on theplaintiff, it was held that the first thrower was responsible ; that thenew direction and force flowed out of the first force, and was not anew trespass. So, here the act of Lartigue directly flowed fromthe original fault of the defendant ; was occasioned by it, and mustbe considered as making a part of it. I think the plaintiff hasmade out his case, under the law cited at the commencement ofthis opinion, and that the judgment of the parish court should beaffirmed, with costs.Martin, J. Nothing can be clearer than the position, that a personwho, in this state, deals with a black man, exposes himself, incaseof his being a slave, to all the consequences which follow thedealing with a slave ; the presumption being, that a black man isa slave ; as by far the greatest proportion of persons of that colorare, in this state, held in slavery. There would be no possibility ofpunishing illegal acts relating to that species of property, if theknowledge of the actual slavery of the negro was essentially to beproven in the trespass.The liquor which intoxicated the slave, having been furnishedhim in the defendant s shop, he must be amenable for the consequences.It is clear, that the spirituous liquor which the plaintiff sslave obtained there was the cause of his intoxication ; as it appearsin evidence that he proceeded from the shop to the boat, andthat a short time after he fell in the water, and was drowned. Itappears to me, that the drowning was the immediate consequenceof the supply of spirits procured in the defendant s shop ; he must,PENALTIES FOR TRADING WITH, &c. 441of course, abide the consequence* I concur in Judge Porter sopinion.Mathews, J. I concur with my colleagues. Judgment affirmed.2.STATE v. Alone. May T. 1819. 2 Nottt & M Cord s Rep. 27.Indictment for trading with a slave without a ticket. It ap Butt-apfeared the defendant left one of his slaves in his store to buy and jy^tra&ugsell for him in his absence.

It was objected, vthe defendant could not be convicted, in as much as the corn wasgiven by the overseer to the negro for the purpose of detecting thedefendant.The court, Richardson, J., held, that where the goods were givenby the master or owner on purpose to entrap the person whomight trade with the slave, and where the master or owner stoodand saw the act of trading for the purpose of detection, it does legalizesuch ; nor is it a defence which will avail the defendant. Thesame principle was laid down in the State v. Stroud, in a note tothe end of the case in the text,3.THE STATE v. PEMBERTON and SMITH.

SMITH. Aug. T. 1816. 13 Johns. Rep. 322.An action Smith, the defendant in error, brought an action of trespass incaselies the court below, against the plaintiff in error, to recover damagesfor seduce and harboring his man servant. It was objected thatthe action should have been debt, under the 1 5th section of the"act concerning slaves and servants." (2 N. R. L. 206.,) but theexception was overruled, and judgment was given for the defendantin error.Per Cur. The statute penalty for harboring slaves or servantsis cumulative, and does not destroy the common law remedy.Judgment affirmed.*By Aiken s Ala.

ByHARBORING SLAVES. 4482.DARK v. MARSH, July T. 1815. 2 North Carolina Law Repository249.This was an action of debt to recover the penalty under the 4th dissectionof the act of 1791, against harboring slaves. The declare training arunawaytion contained three counts : 1. For enticing and persuading the slave with-slaveto leave the plaintiff s service. 2. For harboring and main leaning oftraining the slave, knowing her to be a runaway. The jury found ^^ ofa verdict for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the court, on the act ofthe following case. The plaintiff proved a title to the two slaves,mother and child, under a bill of sale, and possession of them fromFebruary 1807, until the September following, when she absented fraudulentherself with her child, in the night time, taking with her all her and mainapparel, and was the next morning in possession of the defendant, fcwho at that time, gave notice to the plaintiff of the fact, and saidhe should retain them until recovered by law; as he claimed themas his father s property. The defendant has had them in possessiontill 1813, harboring and maintaining them, but in an open andavowed manner, the woman being the wife of one of his negromen. The plaintiff sued out a writ of detinue for the slaves in1807, and in September 1813, recovered them, and damages forthe detention. The writ in the present action was sued outin 1809.Per Cur. Swell, J. The jury have found for the defendantthe act of 1836, any person or persons, harboring, &c. any runaway slave, knowinghim to be such, shall, on conviction, be punished by imprisonment in the penitentiary,at hard labor, for a period not exceeding 10, nor less than 3 years. In Kentucky, bythe act of 1830, p. 173, any person concealing or harboring a runaway slave, knowinghim to be such, in addition to compensation to the owner, shall, on conviction, pay afine not exceeding $500, nor less than $50, and also give security for good behaviourduring his stay in the state. By Lisle s Louisiana Dig. vol. 1, p. 121. any personharboring, concealing, or hiring any runaway slave, shall be fined in a sum not exceeding$300, nor less than $100 ; Ib. p. 398, any person harboring, &c. knowingthem to be such, &c. shall, on conviction, be fined in a sum not exceeding $1000, norless than $200, and be imprisoned not exceeding 2 years, nor less than 6 months.By 2 Brevard s Dig Laws of South Carolina, p. 237., any free negro, mulatto, mestizo,or slave, guilty of harboring, &c. a runaway slave or slaves, charged or accused ofany criminal matter, if a slave, shall receive such corporal punishment, not extendingto life and limb, as the court shall think fit ; and if a free negro, &c. shall forfeit to theuse of the owner, 10 for the first day, so harbored or concealed, and 1 for everydayafter ; and if unable to pay said forfeiture, shall be publicly sold to pay the same.Ib. p. 257. harboring any negro illegally brought into the state, shall forfeit and pay$100, for every such offence.444 SLAVERY.on all the counts in the declaration, except the one for harboringand maintaining the slave as a runaway. Upon that count we thinkthere can be no doubt as to what verdict they should have found,under the facts which form the case. The act of assembly givesa penalty, where any person shall " harbor or maintain under anypretence whatever, any runaway servant or slave."Now, it has been contended by the plaintiff s counsel, that if theslave was a runaway, and was in the possession of defendant, andretained by him, that it was then such a case as was provided forbythe act, which from the words, " under any pretence," wouldreach every possible case. That the legislature was competentto give a penalty in such a case, we do not deny, but feel warrantedin saying they have not said so, or intended it, in this case.The act has in express words given a penalty for harboring ;-^harboring is a term well understood in our law, and means & fraudulentconcealment ; and the legislature not having said in what a.maintaining under any pretence consists, we are left to find it out byconstruction. To us it seems clear, that it is a safe rule in construction,where acts of a known and definite meaning are describedas constituting an offence, and then other words of a generalnature are used as synonymous with the former, andapparently with a view of giving the act a liberal construction insuppression of the mischief, that these general expressions shouldnot render penal by construction, any act which does not partakeof the qualities of the act specially set forth. Such a constructionwould lead us to say, that the maintaining, intended by the legislature,was secret and fraudulent ; this being negatived by the statementof the case, we think the jury should have found for the defendanton this count, and are all of opinion there should be judgementfor defendant.3.GORDON, by his next friend v. FARQUHAR. June T. 1823. Peck sTennessee Rep. 155.Harboring Per Cur. Haywood, J. This was a warrant in debt, before adont under justice of the peace, for fifty dollars, founded on the act of 1799,property cb 28j sec 2 > for enticing g and persuading a certain slave namedand not Violet, from the service of the plaintiff, her master. The causeto subtract went into the circuit court by appeal, where there was a trial andfro nfthe verdict for the defendant. The clause in the act on which theHARBORING SLAVES. 445warrant was founded, declares " that if any person shall hereafter owner,entice or persuade any servant or slave to absent him or herself i n the actfrom his or her owner s service, or shall harbor or maintain underany pretence whatever."On the trial it appeared, that the defendant met with the slave,who was absent under a pass or permit from the plaintiff, whoclaimed to be the owner under a purchase at sheriff s sale, andclaiming an interest in the slave under a deed of trust, which deedwas held by Tubb as trustee ; he directed the slave to go to Tubb,who he said had a claim to her, under which direction the slave went,The deed of trust was shown in defence, but it was insisted itwas fraudulent, and should be viewed as a nullity. No part of thecharge of the court is called in question, so far as it goes, but it isinsisted that the judge should have charged the jury, that ifjhe de->fendant claimed the girl by a deed fraudulent and void in law, hecould not, by virtue thereof, justify persuading and enticing herfrom her owner s service. But the court, though requested, refusedso to charge, having charged " that though the defendantmight have persuaded her to put herself under the protection ofTubb ; yet, if he did it under a belief that he had a good equitableor a legal title in Tubb, then he is not embraced in the act ofassembly."The words, " under any pretence whatever," in the act of assembly,are referable to the harboring, not to the words " enticefrom the service of the owners ;" this latter sentence means an acknowledgedowner, not one whose claim is opposed by that of thedefendant, by virtue of another claim of his own. If the priorpossession is to be regarded, and he who is the owner with openpossession is not to be disturbed, then a new possession taken byforce and avowedly as a recaption, is not the object of the penaltyawarded by this law, for that is but a restitution to the state,from which it ought not to have been taken, and one which is effectedwithout force, and not without a justificatory motive. Thepenalty is to be recovered before a justice of the peace, and certainlyit cannot be pretended that the justice must decide on themerits of the respective claims, of course he cannot determinewhether one of the claims be fraudulent or not. He can only enquireinto the motive of the person charged, and whether it besuch as the act condemns, that is, a desire to meddle with the propertyof another, to which the defendant had himself no colemanSLAVERY,ble claim, and to subtract from the owner, profits which the offenderhas no reason or pretence for claiming.4.Coquet v. RICHARDSON. March T. 1832. 3 Louisiana Rep. 452.A person Damages were claimed from the defendant, on the ground ofTorsion navy g concealed and employed a runaway slave belonging to theoffa slave plaintiff. The general issue was pleaded, and it appeared from theright or ti testimony, that a female slave aged about twelve years, was broughthis motives * the defendant s house by a carman, to whom she had stated shebe not was f ree . gie remained with the defendant for nearly a year, dur-criminal,isliable for ing which time every publicity was given to the fact of her livingthere, and attempts made to discover whether she was a slave, andto w * hom she belonged. There was no paper published in thecover the parish where the defendant resided ; nor did it contain a jail ; itwas further shown that the defendant was a justice of the peace.The plaintiff proved property in the slave ; that he had advertisedher in the papers of New Orleans as a runaway, and expendedone hundred dollars in endeavoring to recover her. There wasjudgment for the defendant in the court below, and the plaintiffappealed.Per Cur. Mathews, J. In this case, damages are claimed fromthe defendant, on account of the concealment and detention of afemale slave, the property of the plaintiff. The court below renderedjudgment in favor of the former, from which the latter appealed.The amount claimed is in conformity with the acts of thelegislature, (part of the Black Code,) passed in 1807 and 1809,and which relate to the penalty and punishment for harboring andconcealing runaway slaves. These acts seem intended to fix thepenalties to which offenders against their provisions may be legallysubjected on conviction ; they are pecuniary, but may be changedinto imprisonment, if the persons convicted has not the means necessaryto pay to owners of slaves the compensation accorded.See, Moreau s Dig. p. 119-20. In addition to the compensationallowed to owners, by the first article, a fine is imposed for thebenefit of the parish, wherein the offender may be convicted, bythe second. Same book, p. 121. These laws are evidently penal,and have relation to public offences. Whether the owner of aslave, which may have been concealed or hired without leave, canpursue the person offending, in a civil action, and on proof of theHARBORING SLAVES. 447offence recover the penalty prescribed by law ? is a question whichthe present case (according to the testimony,) does not require tobe settled, as we are of opinion with the court below that the proofdoes not establish any criminal concealment or illegal hiringagainst the defendant. The petition contains a claim for damagesto the amount of one hundred dollars, exclusive of the penaltyfixed by law. The testimony is somewhat contradictory as to thevalue of the services of the slave. She is a girl about twelve yearsof age, and if healthy, her work and labor must be presumed to beworth something. Be this, however, as it may, it is in evidencethat one hundred dollars were paid by the husband of the plaintiff,in recovering possession of this slave. Although the conduct ofthe defendant, as shown by the proof of the cause, cannot be heldas criminal, yet viewed either as an individual or a justice of thepeace, there is such remissness and negligence on his part, as oughtto subject him to all loss and damages actually suffered by theplaintiff in relation to her property, of which he had possession,without right or title. Judgment reversed.5.STRAWBRIDGE v. TURNER, et al. March T. 1836. 9 LouisianaRep. 213.This was an action brought by the plaintiff to recover from the Where thedefendants, owners of the steamboat Chesapeake, the value of a aTteam-slave alleged to have been illegally employed by the captain of theboat as a hand, without the authority or consent of the plaintiff; tobVem-and while in this service was drowned.Per Cur. Martin, J. The plaintiff claims the value of a slave,employed as a hand on board the steamboat Chesapeake, by thedefendants, without his authority or consent, and who was drown thirty andedby jumping or falling overboard. This case was before this master"court last year, and remanded for a new trial. See 8 Louisiana and he wasaccidentalReports 537. drowned,After the cause was remanded, and before the second trial, the Jhefowneraplaintiff amended his petition, by the addition of an averment, that of the boatthe defendants, by due diligence, might have prevented the slave sponsibiebeing employed as a hand. The parties went to trial on this additionalallegation to the former cause of action. There was asecond verdict and judgment for the plaintiff, and the defendantsappealed.The fact of the slave being employed as a hand on board the448 SLAVERY.steamboat, was fully proved. It further appears, that the plaintiffon hearing his slave was on board, went there with the intentionof arresting him, and in the attempt,^the boy, in endeavoring to effecthis escape, fell overboard, and was drowned.The defendant s counsel, urged with some earnestness in theargument of the case, that the hiring and employment of the slavewas not the immediate cause of the drowning ; but that it was occasionedimmediately by the pursuit of the master.The plaintiff on the other hand, produced evidence which showsclearly the want of due diligence in the owners of the steamboat,in suffering the slave in question to be engaged for several days inunloading and loading her in the city of New Orleans, where theyresided. This they could have prevented and did not. The plaintiffhas had two verdicts in his favor. His slave absconded, andwent on board the steamboat in an illegal and improper manner.He was illegally and without authority hired by the master, ofwhich fact the jury seem to have believed the owners had notice.It does not appear that they made any inquiry whether he wasemployed on board with or without the knowledge and consent ofthe plaintiff, his master. The verdict must therefore stand, andremain undisturbed.INDEX.ABATEMENT, [See Hiring.]ABSENCE,Leave of, [See Fugitive.]ABSOLUTE, Deed, [See Deed,]Property, [See Frauds.]Vice, [See Warranty.]ABUSE,of slaves, [See Liabilities to master.ACCESSORY,before the fact, [See Crimes.]ACCOUNT, [See Mortgage, Remainder.]Acknowledgment,by possessor, [See Frauds.]ACQUITTAL,Judgment of, [See Crimes.]Verdict of, [See Liabilities of masterand others.]ACTIONS,against Co-tenant, [See Recovery.]joint, for freedom, [See Freedom.]on the Case, [See Harboring.

seize a gun while endeavoringto make his escape. 200To excuse a trespass for accidentallykilling a slave, it must appearto have been done without the faultof the person killing. 201The proper rule of damages, is thevalue of the slave at the the time ofhis death to master. 202A slave cannot be killed while flyingfrom his pursuers, by the statuteof 1740, or at common law ; and theowner will be compensated for hisloss if killed. 202The penalty of killing a slave, actsupon the person, not on the offence.203An indictment under the act for killinga negro, should specify the criminalnature and degree of offence,and the facts and circumstancesrendering defendant guilty. 203LIABILITIES of Master.A physician cannot sustain an actionagainst for curing the slave of adisease, without his knowledge, unlessin case of necessity. 225Or during his absence. 225And owner is not liable for medicalattendance upon a hired slave,given at request of hirer. 226Where a slave was accustomed todeliver to a tanner raw hides, andreceive tanned leather in return, bydirections of his master, he is responsibleto tanner for the differencein their value. 227A master may constitute his slavehis agent. 228The owner is entitled to the landwarrant issued by the state to slavefor military services rendered bythe slave in the war of the revolution.229The master is not liable for damagesfrom the negligence of his slave. 230Nor for injuries caused by theslave s negligent conduct, when notacting in his employment and underhis authority. 236Contra in Louisiana. 231But generally, he is not liable forthe acts of his servants, unless doneINDEX.by his authority, and the principalnever, for the criminal acts of hismere civil agent. 232The manumission of a slave is anact of benevolence, and obligatoryupon the master, if in writing, anddoes not rest upon the principles ofa contract upon consideration. 232A court of Equity cannot enforcea contract between master and slaveif the slave has even complied withthe conditions upon which hismaster agreed to emancipatehim. 233. 237In North Carolina, an owner of aslave under the act of 1797, is liableto pay on his conviction of a capitalcharge, the costs of prosecution,prison, and execution fees. 234And is liable for the jail fees andother costs, having due notice of thecriminal charge. 235The owner may be civily prosecutedfor damages for theft of slave,without a previous criminal prosecution.234A master is liable for trespass committedby slave, and it is not materialwhether he acted by his directionand sanction or not. 235LIABILITIES to Master, by others.Trespass will not lie by master foran assault and battery on his slave,unless attended by a loss of service,but is an indictable offence. 239Trespass may be justified wherethe slave was at an unlawful assembly,combining to rebel, refused tosurrender, and resisted by force. 239 jAnd an assault and battery commit jted upon a slave without cause orprovocation is an indictable offence.239Trespass may be maintained bythe master for the battery of hisslave. 243An assault with an attempt to murdera slave is indictable. 244The master is not liable to an indictmentfor a battery upon a slavehired by him. 244The statute penalty for harboringslaves is cumulative and does not de !stroy the common law remedy. 248 jTestimony cannot be offered in mitigationof damages in justificationof an action of trespass, that plaintiffhad given defendant permissionto visit his slaves and chastise anyof them found acting improperly.248Where a mariner slave is illegallydischarged from on board a shipabroad, his wages can be recoveredby his master up to the time whenhe might have returned to the U.States. 233And that the owner of a slave maymaintain a suit for his wages, as amariner on board a coasting vessel.262A master may claim the benefit ofa lawful and voluntary engagementmade in favor of his slave on anequitable consideration by a personcapable of contracting. 263A civil action may be brought bythe master for enticing away hisslave, notwithstanding it may be afelony under the act. 264LIABILITIES TO MASTER,For maiming, killing, or murderingslaves.A plaintiff recovering the full valueof his slave on an injury done bydefendant, upon his paying thejudgment, slave should be placed inhis possession. 249A variance in the indictment forthe murder of a slave from thewords of the statute, was held bythe court to be immaterial. 249In a suit for killing a slave, presumptiveevidence supports theverdict. 249The murder of a slave under theact of 1821, is of the same gradeand character as the murder of awhite man at common law, andmust be made out by the samekind of proof. 251In an action for damages for killing 1a slave, plaintiff may be permittedto discontinue that part of the suitwhich charged defendant as overseer,with gross negligence andand mismanagement of his plantationand slaves. 251INDEX.In the state of Mississippi, murder | MAGISTRATE,may be committed on a slave, ason a freeman. 252The court declared that under theact of 9th Feb. 1819, a slavewas a pel-son on whom the offenceof stabbing and shooting might becommitted, and that the act was intendedto protect them as well asfree persons from such outrages. 254Slaying a slave feloniously withoutmalice, is manslaughter, and subjectsthe offender to punishment.555LiBER-Statu,[See Emancipation, Freedom,
