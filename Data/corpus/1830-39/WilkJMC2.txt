II. B2 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. IV.rank so far above all the other subdivisions of thesecond caste, I may be excused for treating almostas if distinct from it. We now proceed to noticethe other members of this caste ; the principalsubdivisions of which consisted of the military justmentioned, the farmers, husbandmen, gardeners,huntsmen, and boatmen.The statement of Diodorus, who says, the husbandmenwere hired to till the estates of the kings,priests, and soldiers, is so strongly confirmed by thescriptural account of the cession of all the landedproperty to the government on the occasion ofJoseph's famine, that we are reduced to the necessityof concluding, the husbandman had no rightsin the soil, the richer peasants farming the landfrom the proprietor, while the poor were hired aslabourers for the cultivation of the ground. Thewages paid them were trifling *, and it may beinferred that the farmer received the land on verymoderate terms. The cattle, flocks, or herds, whichwere tethered in the clover, appear also to havebelonged to the land-owner ; but those employedin the plough, and for other agricultural purposes,were usually the property of the farmer. In extensivedomains, the peasants frequently acted assuperintendents of the herdsmen, and were obligedto give an account to the steward of the numberand condition of the cattle on the estate, thedirect care of them being the office of an inferiorclass of people : the clover was also let, as at thepresent day, to any person who had cattle, whichDiodor. i. 7+.CHAP. IV. FARMERS AND GARDENERS. 3were tethered in the meadows about the close ofautumn, and, at other seasons of the year, particularlyduring the period of the inundation, werefed in the villages and farm-yards on hay, whichhad been dried and preserved for the purpose.*If the farmer had no right in the soil, it is stillreasonable to suppose, that the choice of the cropdepended chiefly on his decision, care being taken,as is still the custom in Egypt, as well as in othercountries, that the land should not be injured byan imprudent repetition of similar crops t : and,indeed, from what Diodorus says, it is evident thefarmers were not only permitted to choose thegrain they intended to cultivate, but were justlydeemed the only persons of sufficient experience toform a judicious opinion on the subject ; and soskilful were they, says the historian, about thesematters, in the study of which they were broughtup from their youth, that they far excelled theagriculturists of every other nation. They carefullyconsidered the nature of the soil, the propersuccession of crops, and the mode of tilling andirrigating the fields ; and by a constant habit ofobservation, and by the lessons received fromtheir parents, they were acquainted with the exactseason for sowing and reaping, and with all thepeculiarities of each species of produce.The gardeners were employed by the rich incultivating trees and flowers in the parterres .i, 36. Like the trees, dried clover of modern Egypt.+ M. Macaire has shown the reason of this, and proved by experimentsthat the noxious matter thrown out by roots of vegetables unfitsthe soil for the growth of the same plant, though it may be beneficial toanother kind.B 2THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS.

They conductedthe dogs to the field, they had the managementof them in loosing them for the chase, and theysecured and brought home the game, having generallycontributed with their own skill to increasethe sport of the chasseur. They also followed thisoccupation on their own account, and secured forthemselves considerable profit, by catching thoseanimals that were prized for the table, by the rewardsgiven for destroying the hyaena and othernoxious animals, and by the lucrative chase of theostrich, which was highly valued for its plumesand eggs *, and was sold to the wealthier Egyptians.No. 77.Ostrich, with the feathers and eggs.T/itbts.The boatmen, like others who composed thesubdivisions of each caste, were of different grades :some belonged to the private sailing or pleasureThat ostrich eggs were also highly prized, is evident from theirforming part of the tributes brought to the kings.CHAP.

The office of steersman seems to have beenthe most important, and to have ranked above allthe other grades ; but it is reasonable to supposethat when the Egyptians undertook naval expeditions,the more warlike occupation of the sailorraised that class of people in the estimation of theircountrymen, and the pilots of ships of war bore thehighest station in the class of boatmen. The officersof their fleet were probably selected from the army *,and the marines, or fighting men, who served onboard,were all of the military order, tTHE THIRD CASTE.The third caste consisted of artificers, tradesmenor shopkeepers, musicians, builders, masons, carpenters,cabinet-makers, potters, public weighers,and an inferior class of notaries.Among the artificers may be reckoned braziersand smiths of all kinds, in short, all whopursued any handicraft occupation not includedamong those which I have distinctly mentioned ;and the leather cutters, many of whom are saidto have lived at Thebes in the quarter of theMemnoniat, were doubtless a branch of the sameclass. Their skill in stamping leather was very remarkable; and many specimens of unusual thinnessThe Austrian admirals at the present day are military men.f Sculptures at Medeenet Haboo.% In the papyrus of Mr. Grey.

They foresaw that without such a lawAs the Seroogeeh, or saddlers ; the Harrateen, turners ; the Wara-keen, paper-sellers, and others, which are the names of the streets ofCairo where they have their shops.f Diodor. i.

TRADES. 9constant interruptions would take place, in consequenceof the necessity, or the desire, of becoming-conspicuousin a public station ; that their properoccupations would be neglected, and that manywould be led by vanity and self-sufficiency tointerfere in matters which were out of their sphere.Moreover, they considered that to follow morethan one occupation would be detrimental to theirown interests, and to those of the community atlarge ; and that when men, from a motive of avarice,are induced to engage in numerous branches ofart, the result generally is, that they are unable toexcel in any. Such, adds Diodorus, is the case insome countries, where artists occupy themselves inagricultural pursuits, or in commercial speculation,and frequently in two or three different arts atonce. Many, again, in those communities which aregoverned according to democratical principles, arein the habit of frequenting popular assemblies, and,dreaming only of their own interests, receive bribesfrom the leaders of parties, and do incredible mischiefto the state. But with the Egyptians, if anyartisan meddled with political affairs, or engagedin any other employment than the one to whichhe had been brought up, a severe punishment wasinstantly inflicted upon him ; and it was with thisview that the regulations, respecting their publicand private occupations, were instituted by theearly legislators of Egypt.It is unnecessary to enter into any detail of thepeculiar employments of the various members of theclass of artificers and tradesmen, as mention will beTHE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS.CHAP. IV.made of them in noticing the manufactures of thecountry ; I therefore confine myself to a few remarkson the office of the public weighers orqabbdneh, and notaries. The business of the formerwas to ascertain the exact weight of every objectpresented to them in the public street, or market *,where they temporarily erected their scales, and toadjust the sale of each commodity with the strictestNo. 7SQabboineh, or public weighers, and notariesregard to justice, without favouring either thebuyer or seller. All things sold by weight weresubmitted to this test; and even the value of the" The superintendence of weights and measures " belonged to thepriests, until the Romans took away that privilege.

IV.MONEY.money paid for them was settled by the same unquestionablecriterion. It was owing to this customthat the money paid by the sons of Jacob forthe corn they purchased, and which had beenreturned into their sacks, was said to be found of*' full weight *;" and it is highly probable that thepurity of gold and silver was subjected to the trialoffire.tTheir money, as I shall have occasion to observe,was in rings of gold and silver ; and it is remarkablethat the same currency is to this dayemployed in Senna, and the neighbouring countries.But whether those rings had any governmentstamp to denote their purity, or to serve as atest of their value, I have not been able to cetero.7aRings of gold and silver.Exod. xliii. 21.

Theyhad certain standard weights, as the shekel of the sanctuary. Romanmoney was also weighed in ancient times. Liv. iv. 60.

CHAP.

IV. EGYPTIAN WRITING. 13from their parents or friends that art to whichthey were brought up ; and the common people,as might be supposed, were entirely ignorant ofthe art of writing.EGYPTIAN WRITING.The characters used by the Egyptians consistedof three different kinds, — the hieroglyphic*, thehieratic, and enchorial ; the first and last known toall who received a good education ; the hieraticconfined more particularly to the priests. Thereis reason to believe the enchorial did not exist ata very remote period ; the earliest inscriptionswritten in that character, hitherto discovered, notdating prior to the accession of the Polemics ;and some of the hieratic in the time of Dariusseems to be undergoing a transition to this newform. Indeed, the appearance of the letters provesthem to have been derived from the hieratic, whichis itself directly taken from the hieroglyphic ; andit is probable that this last was the sole mode ofwriting known to the Egyptians in the earliestperiods of their history, though the hieratic, a muchearlier invention than the enchorial, dates from avery remote era.Clement of Alexandria! says, those who areeducated among the Egyptians learn three differentmodes of writing, one of which is the epistolaryThe hieroglyphic has been called the monumental, but it is alsoused in papyri, and for all the purposes for which the other two areemployed.f Stroma. lib. v.14 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. IV.(enchorial), the other, the sacerdotal (hieratic), andthe third, the hieroglyphic ; and though Porphyry,in his life of Pythagoras, gives to the hieratic thename of symbolic, it is evident he alludes to thesame modes of writings, when he says that thephilosopher, during his stay in Egypt, learnt thethree different kinds of letters, — the apostolic, thehieroglyphic, and the symbolic. Herodotus* mentionstwo, — the sacred and demotic; but as hespeaks of their writing from right to left, it ispossible that he only here alludes to the two cursorycharacters, the hieratic and enchorial, withoutcomprehending the hieroglyphics under the head ofwriting.FALSE WEIGHTS.The great confidence reposed in the publicweighers rendered it necessary to enact suitablelaws in order to bind them to their duty ; andconsidering how much public property was at theirmercy, and how easily bribes might be taken froma dishonest tradesman, the Egyptians inflicted asevere punishment as well on the weighers as onthe shopkeepers, who were found to have falseweights and measures, or to have defrauded thepurchaser in any other way. Scribes who keptfalse accounts, made erasures from public documents,forged a signature, or altered any agreementswithout the consent of the parties, werepunished, like the preceding offenders, with theloss of both their hands ; on the principle, saysHeriot. ii. 30.CHAP. JV. SHEPHERDS AN ABOMINATION. 15Diodorus, that the offending member should suffer*,and, while the culprit expiated the crime witha most signal punishment, that the severity of theexample might deter others from the commissionof a similar offence.FOURTH CASTE.The fourth caste was composed of pastors, poulterer,fowlers, fishermen, labourers, servants t, andcommon people.PASTORS.The pastors, who were divided into differentclasses, consisted of others, shepherds, goatherds,swineherd, and others, whose occupation was totend the herds of the rich in the pastures, duringthe grazing season, and to prepare the provender,required for them, when the waters of the Nilecovered the irrigated lands. They were lookedupon by the rest of the Egyptians as a degradedclass, who followed a disgraceful employ ment ; andit is not surprising that Pharaoh should havetreated the Jews with that contempt which it wascustomary for every Egyptian to feel towards shepherds.Nor can we wonder at Joseph's warninghis brethren, on their arrival, of this aversion ofthe Egyptians, who, he assured them, considered*' every shepherd an abomination t;" and fromDiodor. i. 78. This !cx- (a/ioiu.sis a very primitive mode of punishingcrime. Vide Deut. xix. 21.f Gen. xii. 16. Exod. ii. 5.j Gen. xlvi. .34. According to Herodotus (ii. 46.) goatherds weremuch honoured in the Mendesian none.16 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. IV.his recommending them to request they mightdwell in the land of Goshen, we may conclude itwas with a view to avoid as much as possiblethose who were not shepherds like themselves, orto obtain a settlement in the land peculiarly adaptedfor pasture*; and it is probable that much ofPharaoh's cattle was also kept there, since themonarch gave orders that if any of the Jews wereremarkable for skill in the management of herds,they should be selected to overlook his owncattle t, after they were settled in the land ofGoshen.The hatred borne against shepherds by theEgyptians, was not owing solely to their contemptfor that occupation ; this feeling originated in anotherand a far more powerful cause, — the previousoccupation of their country by a pastor race, whohad committed great cruelties during their possessionof the country ; and the already existing prejudiceagainst shepherds, when the Hebrews arrived,plainly shows their invasion to have happenedprevious to that event, t As if to prove how muchthey despised every order of pastors, the artists,both of Upper and Lower Egypt, delighted on alloccasions in representing them as dirty and unshaven; and at Beni Hassan and the tombs nearthe Pyramids of Geese, we find them caricaturedas a deformed and unseemly race.The swineherd were the most ignoble, and ofThe Delta and those lands lying to the east of the Damietta branchof the Nile are still preferred for grazing cattle,-f- Gen. xlvii. 6.X Vide p. 20. and 38.CHAP. IV.

Likethe other classes, their office descended fromfather to son, and the same occupation was followedby successive generations.The skill of these people, in rearing animals ofdifferent kinds, was the result, says Diodorust, ofthe experience they had inherited from theirparents, and subsequently increased by their ownobservation; and the spirit of emulation, which isnatural to all men, constantly adding to their stockof knowledge, they introduced many improvementsunknown to other people. Their sheep were twiceshorn, and twice brought forth lambs in the courseof one years ; and though the climate was the chiefcause of these phenomena, the skill and attentionof the shepherd were also necessary ; nor, if theanimals w-ere neglected, would unaided naturealone suffice for their continuance.But of all the discoveries to which any class ofEgyptians attained, the one, says the historian,which is most worthy of admiration, is their modeIlerodot. ii. 47.

Theyfed them for the table ; and, independent of thenumber required for private consumption, a greatmany were exclusively fattened for the service ofthe temple, as well as for the sacred animals t, andfor the daily rations! of the priests and soldiers, orothers who lived at the government expense, andfor the king himself. §Their geese were the vulpanser of the Nile, andothers of the same genus still common on its banks,many of which were tamed and fed like ordinarypoultry. Those in a wild state were caught inlarge,clap nets, and being brought to the poulterer,were salted and potted in earthenwarevases. II Others were put up in the shop for im-themodern Egyptians (particularly the Copts) have borrowedthis custom from their predecessors, and eggs are annually hatched inthe towns of Upper and Lower Egypt. Vide my Egypt and Thebes,p. 24-6., where the process is described.-|- Diodorus (i. 84.) says, " Some were fed with the meat of geese,both boiled and roast, and others, which lived on raw food, were providedwith birds caught by the fowlers."X Herodot. ii. 37.

The same care was taken to preserve theyoung of gazelles, and other wild animals of thec '^CHAP. IV.

And in order togive an idea of the pains they took in rearing thesetimid animals, and to show the great value of thepossessions of the deceased, they are introducedwith the cattle, in the sculptures of the tombs.The fishermen mostly used the net : it was of along form, like the common drag-net, with woodenfloats on the upper, and leads on the lower, side* ;but though it was sometimes let down from a boat,those who pulled it generally stood on the shore,and landed the fish on a shelving bank. Theleads were occasionally of an elongated shape,hanging from the outer cord or border of the net,but they were more usually flat, and, being foldedround the cord, the opposite sides were beatentogether ; a satisfactory instance of which is seenin the ancient net preserved in the Berlin Museum,No. 82. Leads, with part of a net. Berlin Museum,Vide wood-cut, No. 81., opposite page.c S22 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS, CHAP. IV.and this method still continues to be adopted by themodern Egyptians.In a country where fish will not admit of beingkept, the same persons who caught them were thesole venders, and the fishermen may be consideredan undivided body. The class of labourers, onthe contrary, consisted of several different subdivisions,according to their occupation ; among whomwe may, perhaps, include the workers in mud andstraw, and bricklayers*, as well as those who performedvarious drudgeries in the field and in thetown : but as I shall have occasion to speak ofthem hereafter, I now content myself with thesegeneral remarks, and pass on to the considerationof the government and laws of the country.THE LEGISLATIVE RIGHTS OF THE KING.The king had the right of enacting last, andof managing all the affairs of religion and of thestate ; and so intimate was the connection of thesetwo, that the maintenance of the one was consideredessential for the very existence of the other. Thisnotion has, indeed, always been cherished in theEast ; and we find Khandemir and other Moslemwriters give it as a received opinion, that the statecannot exist without religion, and that " it is ofminor consequence if the former perishes, providedMany of those who made bricks, and worked in the field, wereforeign slaves, as I have already observed ; and on them, no doubt, fellthe most arduous portion of these laborious tasks. But it was notonly the Jews who were so treated : other captives were similarly employed,as we see in the sculptures at Thebes, where the Jews neverlived, and where people of other conquered nations are mentioned.

Indeed the wisdom of that people was proverbial,and was held in such consideration by othernations, that we find it taken by the Jews as thestandard to which superior learning* in their owncountry was willingly compared ; and Moses had preparedhimself for the duties of a legislator by becomingversed '* in all the wisdom of the Egyptians"!Besides their right of enacting laws, the kingsadministered justice to their subjects on thosequestions which came under their immediate cognisancet, and they were assisted in the managementof state affairs by the advice of the most able anddistinguished members of the priestly order. § Withthem the monarch consulted upon all questions ofimportance, relating to the internal administrationof the country ; and previous to the admission ofJoseph to the confidence of Pharaoh, the opinionof his ministers was asked, as to the expediencyand propriety of the measure.

His salary was muchgreater than that of the other judges, as his officewas more important; and the city to which he belongedenjoyed the privilege of returning anotherjudge, to complete the number of the thirty fromwhom he had been chosen. They all received ampleallowances from the king ; in order that, possessinga sufficiency for their maintenance and othernecessary expenses, they might be above the reachof temptation, and be inaccessible to bribes: for itwas considered of primary importance, that all judicialproceedings should be regulated with the mostscrupulous exactitude, sentences pronounced byauthorised tribunals* always having a decidedinfluence, either salutary or prejudicial, on theaffairs of common life. They felt that precedentswere thereby established, and that numerous abusesfrequently resulted from an early error, which hadbeen sanctioned by the decision of some influentialperson, and for this reason they weighed the talentsas well as the character of the judge.The first principle was that offenders should bediscovered and punished, and that those who hadbeen wronged should be benefited by the interpositionof the laws ; since the least compensationDiodor. i. lb.26 THE Ancient EGYPTIANS. CHAP. IV.which can be made to the oppressed, and themost effectual preventative of crime, are the speedydiscovery and exposure of the offender. On theother hand, if the terror which hangs over theguilty in the hour of trial could be averted bybribery or favour, nothing short of distrust andconfusion would pervade all ranks of society ; andthe spirit of the Egyptian laws was not merely tohold out the distant prospect of rewards andpunishments, or merely threaten the future vengeanceof the gods *, but to apply the more persuasivestimulus of present retribution.Besides the care taken by them that justiceshould be administered according to the real meritsof the case, and that before their tribunals nofavour or respect of persons should be permitted,another very important regulation was adopted,that justice should be gratuitously administered :and it was consequently accessible to the poor,as well as to the rich. The very" spirit of theirlaws was to give protection and assistance to theoppressed!, and every thing that tended to promotean unblessed judgment was peculiarly commendedby the Egyptian sages. ±When a case was brought for trial, it was customaryfor the arch-judge to put a golden chain roundhis neck, to which was suspended a small figure ofDiodor. i. 93.

And that this wasreally the case, appears from the account of Diodorustt,who mentions the thirty judges and theirpresident, represented at Thebes in the sculpturesof the tomb of Osymandyas.The president, or arch-judge having put on theemblem of Truth, the trial commenced, and theeight volumes which contained the laws of theEgyptians were placed close to hint, in order toguide his decision, or to enable him to solve adifficult question, by reference to that code, toformer precedents, or to the opinion, of somelearned predecessor. The complainant stated hiscase. This was done in writing ; and everyparticular that bore upon the subject, the mode inwhich the alleged offence was committed, and anestimate of the damage, or the extent of the injurysustained, were inserted.The defendant then, taking up the deposition ofthe opposite party, wrote his answer to each of theplaintiff's statements, either denying the charge,or endeavouring to prove that the offence was notof a serious nature, or, if obliged to admit his guilt,I should rather think that those who had committed any verygrave offence were sent to the capital, than that the Egyptian judgesperformed any circuits for the administration of justice.t Diodor. i. 48. % Diodor. i. 48. 75.30 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. IV.suggesting that the damages were too high, and incompatiblewith the nature of the crime. Thecomplainant replied in writing ; and the accusedhaving brought forward all he had to say in hisdefence, the papers were given to the judges;and if no witnesses* could be produced on eitherside, they decided upon the question according tothe deposition of the parties. Their opinion onlyrequired to be ratified by the president, who thenproceeded, in virtue of his office, to pronouncejudgment on the case ; and this was done by touchingthe party who had gained the cause with thefigure of Truth. They considered that this modeof proceeding was more likely to forward the endsof justice than when the judges listened to the statementsof pleaders ; eloquence having frequentlythe effect of fascinating the mind, and tending tothrow a veil over guilt and to pervert truth. Thepersuasive arguments of oratory, or those artificeswhich move the passions and excite the sympathyof the judges, were avoided, and thus neither didan appeal to their feelings, nor the tears and dissimulationof an offender, soften the just rigourof the laws.t And while ample time was affordedto each party to proffer or to disprove an accusation,no opportunity was given to the offender totake advantage of his opponent, but poor and rich,ignorant and learned, honest and dishonest, wereThis is omitted by Diodorus ; but from the great pains they tookto discover false accusers, and from every kind of probability, we mayconclude they were examined whenever they could be produced.Diodor. i. 77."92.f Diodor. i. 76.CHAP. IV. LAWS. 31placed on an equal footing ; and it was the case,rather than the persons, upon which the judgmentwas passed.LAWS.The laws of the Egyptians were handed downfrom the earliest times, and looked upon with thegreatest reverence. They had the credit of havingbeen dictated by the gods themselves, and Thoth *(Hermes or Mercury) was said to have framedthem for the benefit of mankind.The names of many of the early monarchs andsages who had contributed to the completion oftheir code were recorded and venerated by them ;and whoever at successive periods made additionsto it was mentioned with gratitude as the benefactorof his country, tTruth or justice was thought to be the maincardinal virtue among the Egyptians, inasmuch asit relates more particularly to others ; prudence,temperance, and fortitude being relative qualities,and tending only to the immediate benefit of theindividual who possesses them. It was, therefore,with great earnestness that they inculcated thenecessity of fully appreciating it ; and falsehood wasnot only considered disgraceful, but when it entailedan injury on any other person was punishableby law. A calumniator of the dead was condemnedto a severe punishment t ; and a false accuser wasThe priests, of course, understood the allegorical meaning of thisfable, referring to an intellectual agency : the people received it literally,f Diodor. i. 94.X Diodor. i. 92. " fjnyaXoiQ irepimnrti Trpoort/^otf."32 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. IV.doomed to the same sentence which would havebeen awarded to the accused, if the offence hadbeen proved against him * ; but to maintain a falsehoodby an oath was deemed the blackest crime,and one which, from its complicated nature, couldbe punished by nothing short of death. For theyconsidered that it involved two distinct crimes, — acontempt for the gods, and a violation of faith towardsman ; the former the direct promoter ofevery sin, the latter destructive of all those tieswhich are most essential for the welfare of society.In order more effectually to protect the virtuous,and detect the wicked, it was enacted t that everyoneshould at certain times present himself beforethe magistrates or provincial governors, and givehis name, his place of abode, his profession oremployment, and, in short, the mode in which hegained his livelihood ; the particulars being dulyregistered by the official scribes. The time ofattendance was fixed, and they proceeded in bodiesto the appointed office, accompanied with theirrespective banners!; each member of the bodybeing introduced singly to the registering clerks.In approaching these functionaries, it was requiredConf.

Even if themode of registering the names, which is noticed byDiodorus, and the sculptures of Thebes, does notin reality refer to passports, it is at least very similarin spirit and intent, and may be considered theearliest indication of a custom so notoriously unpleasantto modern travellers.During their examination, if any excesses werefound to have been committed by them, in consequenceof an irregular mode of life, they weresentenced to the bastinado ; but a false statement*,or the proof of being engaged in unlawfulpursuits, entailed upon them the punishment of acapital crime.MURDER.The wilful murder of a freeman, or even of aslave, was punished with death, from the convictionDiodor. i. 77. " tov tv rourotf \\/iv(!ajxivop,^^D ^36 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. IV.that men ought to be restrained from the commissionof sin, not on account of any distinction ofstation in Hfe, but from the light in which theyviewed the crime itself; while at the same time ithad the effect of showing, that if the murder of aslave was deemed an offence deserving of so severea punishment, they ought still more to shudder atthe murder of one who was a compatriot and afree-born citizen.In this law we observe a scrupulous regard tojustice and humanity, and have an unquestionableproof of the great advancement made by the Egyptiansin the most essential points of civilisation,affording a pleasing comment on their character jand it is a striking fact, that neither Greece * norRome, proud as they both were of their superiority,and of their skill in jurisprudence, had thegood sense to adopt or imitate this wise regulation,t Indeed, the Egyptians considered it soheinous a crime to deprive a man of life, that to betheaccidental witness of an attempt to murder,without endeavouring to prevent it, was a capitaloffence, which could only be palliated by bringingproofs of inability to act. With the same spiritthey decided, that to be present when any oneI must do the Greeks the justice to say they acknowledged thesuperior wisdom and equity of the Egyptians, and were in the habit ofconsulting them, and of visiting Egypt to study their institutions.j- Masters had an absolute power of life and death over their slaves,and they generally crucified them, when convicted of a capital offence.Juv.

Sabaco, indeed, duringthe fifty years of his reign, ** made it a rule* not topunish his subjects with death," whether guilty ofmurder or any other capital offence, but, "accordingto the magnitude of their crimes, he condemnedthe culprits to raise the ground about the town towhich they belonged. By these means the situationof the different cities became greatly elevatedabove the reach of the inundation, even more thanin the time of Sesostris ;" and either on accountof a greater proportion of criminals, or from someother cause, the mounds of Bubastist were raisedconsiderably higher than those of any other city.Herodot. ii. 137.f The mounds of Bubastis (Tel Bastii) are of very great height, andare seen from a considerable distance.D 338 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. IV.RIGHT OF FATHERS.Among the Romans, a father had the right ofHfe and death over his son, and could sell him asaslave to a free-born citizen ; no child was thereforefree until his parent had emancipated* him,in the presence of the praetor. The Greeks permittedthe same right to fathers ; and the Spartanseven prevented a parent from nourishing his children: and having submitted them to a certaincourt, it was there decided whether they were tobe preserved, or to be left to die in a cavern ofTargets. But far from adopting so barbarous acustom as the exposure of infants, or allowing afather any right over the life of his offspring, theEgyptians deemed the murder of a child an odiouscrime, that called upon the direct interposition ofthe laws. They did not, however, punish it as acapital offence, since it appeared inconsistent totake away life from one who had given it to thechild t, but preferred inflicting such a punishmentas would induce grief and repentance. With thisview they ordained that the corpse of the deceasedshould be fastened to the neck of its parent, andthat he should be obliged to pass three whole daysand nights in its embrace, under the surveillanceof a public guard.But parricide was visited with the most cruelof chastisements ; and conceiving, as they did, thatthe murder of a parent was the most unnatural ofUnless he was in any public office,f Diodor. i. 77.CHAP. IV. PUNISHMENTS OF WOMEN. ,'^9crimes, they endeavoured to prevent its occurrenceby the marked severity with which it was avenged.The criminal was therefore sentenced to be laceratedwith sharpened reeds, and after being thrownon thorns he was burnt to death.WOMEN.When a woman was guilty of a capital offence,and judgment had been passed upon her, theywere particularly careful to ascertain if the condemnedwas in a state of pregnancy; in which caseher punishment was deferred till after the birth ofthe child, in order that the innocent might notsuffer with the guilty*, and thus the father be deprivedof that child to which he had at least anequal right.But some of their laws regarding the female sexwere cruel and unjustifiable ; and even if, which ishighly improbable, they succeeded by their severityto enforce chastity, and to put an effectual stopto crime, yet the punishment rather reminds us ofthe laws of a barbarous people than of a wise andcivilised state. A woman who had committed adulterywas sentenced to lose her nose, upon the principlethat being the most conspicuous feature, andthe chief, or, at least, an indispensable, ornament ofthe face, its loss would be most severely felt, and bethegreatest detriment to her personal charms ; andthe man was condemned to receive a bastinado ofone thousand blows. But if it was proved thatA law atloptcd also by the Athenians.VOL. II. *D 440 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. IV.force had been used against a free woman, he wasdoomed to a cruel and inhuman punishment.*The object of the Egyptian laws was to preservelife, and to reclaim an offender. Death took awayevery chance of repentance, it deprived the countryof his services, and he was hurried out of the worldwhen least prepared to meet the ordeal of a futurestiite. They, therefore, preferred severe punishments,and, except in the case of minder, andsome crimes which appeared highly injurious to thecommunity, it was deemed unnecessary to sacrificethe life of an offender.THE BASTINADO.Some of the laws and punishments of the Egyptianarmy I have already noticed: and in military aswell as civil cases, minor offences were generallypunished with the stick ; a mode of chastisementstill greatly in vogue among the modern inhabitantsof the valley of the Nile, and held in such esteem bythem, that convinced of (or perhaps by) its efficacy,they relate " its descent from heaven as a blessingto mankind," tIf an Egyptian of the present day has a governmentdebt or tax to pay, he stoutly persists in hisinability to obtain the money, till he has withstooda certain number of blows, and considers himselfcompelled to produce it; and the ancient inhabitants,if not under the rule of their native princes, at least inthe time of the Roman emperors, gloried equally inthe obstinacy they evinced, and the difficulty the aiTOKOTrrtGdcn tu aiCoin.

THE BASTINADO. 43was adopted ; nor is it probable that any class ofthe community enjoyed a peculiar privilege onthese occasions, as among the modern Moslems :who, extending their respect for the Prophet to hisdistant descendants of the thirty-sixth and ensuinggenerations, scruple to administer the stick to aShereef until he has been politely furnished with amat, on which to prostrate his guilty person. Amongother amusing privileges in modern Egypt, is thatconceded to the grandees, or officers of high rank.Ordinary culprits are punished by the hand ofpersons usually employed on such occasions ; butaBey, or the governor of a district, can onlyreceive his chastisement from the hand of a Pasha,and the genteel daho.ss (mace) is substituted forthe vulgar stick. This is no trifling privilege : itbecomes fully impressed upon the sufferer, andrenders him, long after, sensible of the peculiarhonour he has enjoyed ; nor can any one doubtthat an iron mace, in form not very unlike a chocolatemill, is a distinguish mode of punishing menwho are proud of their rank.Having noticed the pertinacity of the modernEgyptians in resisting the payment of their taxes,I shall introduce the following story as remarkablyillustrative of this fact. In the year 1822, a CoptChristian, residing at Cairo, was arrested by theTurkish authorities for the non-payment of histaxes, and taken before the Kehia, or deputy ofthe Pasha. " Why," inquired the angry Turk,*' have you not paid your taxes ? " — " Because," repliedthe Copt, with a pitiable expression, pertTHE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN'S. CHAP, IV.fectly according with his tattered appearance, '* Ihave not the means." He was instantly orderedto be thrown upon the floor, and bastinado.He prayed to be released, but in vain : the stickcontinued without intermission, and he was scarcelyable to bear the increasing pain. Again and againhe pleaded his inability to pay, and prayed formercy : the Turk was inexorable ; and the tormentshe felt at length overcame his resolution :they were no longer to be borne. " Release me,"he cried, " and I will pay directly." — " Ah, youGrower ! go." He was released, and taken home,accompanied by a soldier, and the money beingpaid, he imparted to his wife the sad tidings.You coward, you fool," she exclaimed ; " what,give them the money on the very first demand ! Isuppose after five or six blows, you cried, * I willpay, only release me ; ' next year our taxes willbe doubled through your weakness; shame!" —No, my dear," interrupted the suffering man, " Iassure you I resisted as long as it was possible :look at the state I am in, before you upbraid me.I paid the money, but they had trouble enoughfor it ; for I obliged them to give me at least ahundred blows before they could get it." She waspacified ; and the pity and commendation of hiswife, added to his own satisfaction in having shownso much obstinacy and courage, consoled him forthe pain, and, perhaps, in some measure, for themoney thus forced from him.CHAP.

HANGING. 45HANGING.Hanging * was the customary mode of punishmentfor many capital crimes ; and the criminalswere kept *' bound "in prison t till their fate wasdecided ; whether it depended on the will of thesovereign, or the decision of the judges ; and theseplaces of confinement were under the immediatesuperintendence, and within the house, of thechief of the police, tThe character of some of the Egyptian laws wasquite consonant with the notions of a primitiveage. In those cases punishment was directedmore particularly against the offending member ;and adulterers of money, falsities of weightsand measures, forgers of seals or signatures, andscribes who altered any signed document byerasures or additions, without the authority ofthe parties, were condemned to lose both theirhands.But their laws do not seem to have sanctionedthe gibbet, or the exposure of the body of an offender;since the conduct of Rhampsinitus, in thecase of the robbery of his treasure, is mentioned byHerodotus § as a singular mode of discovering anaccomplice, and not as an ordinary punishment.Gen. xl. 22.■j- Gen. xxxix. 20.

Those who followed the professionof thief gave in their names to the chiefof the robbers t ; and agreed that he should be unformedof every thing they might thenceforwardsteal, the moment it was in their possession. Inconsequenceof this the owner of the lost goodsalways applied by letter to the chief for theirrecovery ; and having stated their quality andquantity, the day and hour when they were stolen,and other requisite particulars, the goods wereidentified, and, on payment of one quarter of theirvalue, they were restored to the applicant, in thesame state as when taken from his house.For being fully persuaded of the impracticabilityof putting an entire check to robbery, either bythe dread of punishment, or by any method thatFrom what he afterwards says, we may conclude that the kingpunished great and petty cases in the same manner; his object beingto prevent the contamination of bad example.■j- The same as the Shekh el Harameeh, or Shekh of the robbersin modern Egypt, and at Constantinople.

This was done, that great regard mightalways be had for the name and nature of anoath II, at the same time that, by substituting theunquestionable proof of a written document, theyavoided the necessity of having frequent recourseAs the Shekh of the robbers in Cairo at the present day.t The difficulty of legislating on the subject of debt and usury wasnot only felt by the Egyptians, Romans, and other ancient people, but isacknowledged at the present day.t Diodor. i. 79.§ The number of witnesses in Egyptian contracts is very remarkable.Vide Dr. Young on Hieroglyph.

For the person of every citizenwas looked upon as the property of the state, andmight be required for some public service, connectedeither with war or peace ; and, independentof the injustice of subjecting any one to the momentarycaprice of his creditor, the safety of thecountry mio;ht be endangered throuiz:h the avariceof a few interested individuals.This law, which was borrowed by Solon from theEgyptian code, existed also at Athens; and was, asDiodorus observes, much more consistent withjustice and common sense than that which allowedthe creditor to seize the person, while it forbadehim to take the ploughs and other implements ofhusbandry. For if, continues the historian, it isunjust thus to deprive men of the means of obtainingsubsistence, and of providing for their families,As with the Mosehi)s and the Jews, Psahn xv. 5. ; Ezek. xviii.8. 17. ; and Levity. xxv. 36, 37.f This was also a law at Rome.CHAP. IV. DEBTS AND USURY. 51how much more unreasonable must it be to imprisonthose by whom the implements were used ?To prevent the accumulation of debt, and toprotect the interests of the creditor, another remarkablelaw was enacted *, which, while it showshow greatly they endeavoured to check the increasingevil, proves the high respect paid by theEgyptians to the memory of their parents, and tothe sanctity of their religious ceremonies. By thisit was pronounced illegal for any one to borrowmoney without giving in pledge the body of hisfather, or of his nearest relative t ; and, if he failedto redeem so sacred a deposit t, he was consideredinfamous ; and, at his death, the celebration of theaccustomed funeral obsequies was denied him, andhe could not enjoy the right of burial either in thetomb of his ancestors, or in any other place ofsepulture § ; nor could he inter his children, orany of his family, as long as the debt was unpaid,the creditor being put in actual possession of hisfamily tomb.Herodot. ii. 136.

It is not to be supposed that thisalludes to mummies kept in the houses, which only remained there foracertain time ; since it was honourable to be buried, and a disgraceto be refused that right, as in the case of malefactors. We may concludethe body itself was seldom given up, since possession of thetomb was sufficient, and much less inconvenient to the creditor thanto have a stranger's mummy in his sitting-room.§ Herodot. ii. 136. Diod. i. 92, 93.E 252 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. IV.In the large cities of Egypt, a fondness for display,and the usual allurements of luxury, wererapidly introduced ; and considerable sums wereexpended in furnishing houses, and in many artificialcaprices. Rich jewels and costly works of artwere in great request, as well among the inhabitantsof the provincial capitals as at Thebes andMemphis : they delighted in splendid equipages,elegant and commodious boats, numerous attendants,horses, dogs, and other requisites for thechase ; and, besides, their houses, their villas, andtheir gardens, where laid out with no ordinary expense.But while the funds arising from extensivefarms, and the abundant produce of a fertile soil,enabled the rich to indulge extravagant habits,many of the less wealthy envied the enjoyment ofthose luxuries which fortune had denied to them ;and, prompted by vanity, and a desire of imitation,so common in civilized communities, and so generallyfollowed by fatal results, they pursued a careerwhich speedily led to an accumulation of debt *,and demanded the interference of the legislature ;and it is probable that a law so severe as this musthave appeared to the Egyptians, was only adoptedas a measure of absolute necessity, in order to puta check to the increasing evil.The necessary expenses of the Egyptians wereremarkably small, less indeed than of any people,and the food of the poorer classes was of theIn the time of Sesostns, a very great number of persons were inprison for debt, for \s hose release he thought it necessary to interfere.Diod i. 54.CHAP.

Owing to thewarmth of the climate, they required few clothes,and young children were in the habit of goingwithout shoes, and with little or no covering totheir bodies ; and so trifling was the expense ofbringing up a child, that, as Diodorus affirms *, itnever need cost a parent more than 20 drachms(13 shillings English), until arrived at man's estate.It was, therefore, luxury, and the increasing wantsof an artificial kind, which corrupted the mannersof the Egyptians, and rendered such a law necessaryfor their restraint ; and we may conclude, thatit was mainly directed against those who contracteddebts for the gratification of pleasure, or with thepremeditated intent of defrauding an unsuspectingcreditor.DEEDS.In the mode of executing deeds, conveyances,and other civil contracts, the Egyptians were peculiarlycircumstantial and minute ; and the greatnumber of witnesses is a singular feature in thosedocuments. In the time of the Polemics, sales ofproperty commenced with a preamble, containingthe date of the king, in whose reign they wereexecuted ; the name of the president of the court,and of the clerk by whom they were written,being also specified. The body of the contractthen followed. It stated the name of the individualwho sold the land, the description of hisDiod, i 80.E 354 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. IV.person, an account of his parentage, profession,and place of abode, the extent and nature of theland, its situation and boundaries, and concludedwith the name of the purchaser, whose parentageand description were also added, and the sum forwhich it was bought. The seller then vouched forhis undisturbed possession of it ; and, becomingsecurity against any attempt to dispute his title,the name of the other party was inserted as havingaccepted it, and acknowledged the purchase. Thenames of witnesses were then affixed ; and thepresident of the court, having added his signature,the deed was valid. Sometimes the seller formallyrecognised the sale in the following manner. —*' All these things have I sold thee : they arethine, I have received their price from thee, andmake no demand upon thee for them from this day;and if any person disturb thee in the possessionof them, I will withstand the attempt; and, if Ido not otherwise repel it, I will use compulsorymeans," or, " I will indemnify thee." * But, inorder to give a more accurate notion of the form ofthese contracts, I shall introduce a copy of thewhole of one of them, as given by Dr. Young t,and refer the reader to others occurring in the samework.

We may, however, conclude that theyMere regulated by the customs usual among civilisednations ; and, if the authority of Diodoruscan be credited, women were indulged with greaterprivileges in Egypt than in any other country. Heeven affirms that part of the agreement enteredinto at the time of marriage was, that the wifeshould have control over her husband, and that noobjection should be made to her commands whateverthey might be X ; but, though we have sufficientto convince us of the superior treatment ofwomen among the Egyptians, as well from ancientauthors as from the sculptures that remain, it mayfairly be doubted if those indulgences were carriedto the extent mentioned bv the historian, or thatDiodorus (i. 95.) says, " Many laws which were thought to workwell were changed by the Macedonian dynasty."

Needle-work and embroidery were afavourite amusement of the Grecian women; inwhich it is highly probable the Egyptian ladies alsooccupied much of their time ; and we have positiveevidence, from the sculptures, of numerousVide sitprd, vol. i p. 26.■f- Gen.

Newly married womenwere almost as strictly kept as virgins ; and, by thelaws of Solon, no lady could go out at night withouta lighted torch before her chariot, or leavehome with more than three garments. They wereguarded in the house and abroad by nurses, andsometimes by old men and eunuchs ; and thesecluded life they led was very similar to thatimposed upon females among the modern Moslems.But the Egyptians treated their women very differently,and in a manner much more worthy of acivilised people ; and, if the accounts of ancientauthors are sometimes unsatisfactory, and evencontradictory, on this head, the sculptures assist usto form our conclusions, and to decide in theirfavour. At some of the public festivals womenwere expected to attend, — not alone, like theMoslem women at a mosque, but in company withtheir husbands or relations ; and Joseph us t states,that on an occasion of this kind, " when it was thecustom for women to go to the public solemnity,the wife of Potiphar, having pleaded ill health, inorder to be allowed to stay at home, was excusedfrom attending," and availed herself of the absenceof her husband to talk with Joseph.Their faces were covered, but the veil was thin enough to be seenthrough. It was not, therefore, like the boorko of modern Egypt,which has two holes exposing the eyes, but rather like that of theWahabees, which covers the whole head and face. The Jewish womenalso wore a veil ; and in Solomon's Song one complains that herveil had been taken from her. C. v. 7. Conf. Genes, xxiv. 65.f Joseph. Ant. ii. 4. .3.62 THE Ancient EGYPTIANS. CHAP. IV.Dioclonis informs us the Egyptians were not restrictedto any number of wives, but that everyonemarried as many as he chose, with the exceptionof the priesthood, who were by law confinedto one consort.* It does not, however, appear thatthey generally took advantage of this privilege ;and Herodotus t affirms that throughout Egypt itwas customary to marry only one wife. It is easyto reconcile these statements, by supposing thatDiodorus speaks of a law which permitted ,and Herodotus of the usual custom of thepeople ; and if the Egyptians were allowed to takemore than one wife, we may conclude, from thenumerous scenes illustrative of their domestic life,that it was an event of rare occurrence.Polygamy is permitted to the Moslem, but it isneither reputable to have more than one wife, norto divorce her without very cogent reasons ; andthough no objection can be made when there is nofamily, it is required, even in this case, that herwishes, and those of her parents, should be consulted;and many marriage contracts stipulate thatthe wife shall have no partner in the harem.With much more reason, then, may we concludethat among the higher classes of Egyptians asimilar custom prevailed, which will account forno instance of two consorts being given in thesculptures.The Jewish chief priest was allowed but one wife, and he couldonly marry a virgin.

MARRIAGES WITH SISTERS. 03But a very objectionable law, which is not onlynoticed by Diodorus *, but is fully authenticatedby the sculptures both of Upper and Lower Egypt,was in force among them from the earliest times,the origin and policy of which it is not easy toexplain. Diodorus supposes that the custom — themarriage of brother and sister — was owing to, andsanctioned by, that of Isis and Osiris ; but as thiswas purely an allegorical fable t, and these idealpersonages never lived on earth, his conjecture isof little weight; nor, indeed, would such a circumstancebe sufficient to account for so strange a law.In the time of the patriarchs, as in the case ofAbraham and Sarah t, and among the Athenians,an Egyptian colony, it was lawfid to marry a sisterby the father's side, not, however, if born of thesame mother ; but that this restriction was notobserved in Egypt, we have sufficient evidencefrom the marriages of several of the Polemics.Though the Egyptians generally confined themselvesto one wife §, they, like the Jews and otherEastern nations, both of ancient and modern times,scrupled not to admit other inmates to their hareerriyDiodor. i. 27.f The same occurs in the Greek mythology.

" She is my sister: she is the daughter of myfather, but not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife."§ The Jews were generally contented with one wife, though aplurality was permitted also by their laws. 1 Kings, xi. 3.

They became members of the family,like those in a similar situation at the present day,and not only ranked next to the wives and childrenof their lord, but probably enjoyed a share of theproperty at his demise.* These women were whiteor black slaves t, according to the countries fromwhich they were brought ; but, generally speaking,the latter were employed merely as domestics, whowhere required to wait upon their mistress and herfemale friends. The former, likewise, officiated asservants, though they of course held a rank abovethe black slaves ; and it is very probable that thewomen represented at Medeenet Haboo, attendingupon Remeses, were of this class of persons, and,at all events, not the wives of the monarch.CHILDREN.The same custom prevailed among the Egyptiansregarding children, as with the Moslems and otherEastern people : no distinction being made betweentheir offspring by a wife or any other woman,and all equally enjoying the rights of inheritance ;for since they considered a child indebted to thefather for its existence!, and the mother to beThis Eastern custom I suppose also to have been adopted by theancient as well as the modern Egyptians. According to Moslem law,the birth of a child gives the mother a claim, and, indeed, properly aright, to enfranchisement.-|- Vide supra, p. 403, 404.^ " 'Vov TtaTtpii f.iovov aiTioi' eii'at Tin; yti'tdfio^."

And, indeed,if Diodorus is correct t, they carried thisprinciple so far, that, in dioecious plants, thosewhich bore fruit were denominated males, as beingthe cause of production and of the continuation ofthe species.PARENTS.Of their laws respecting the duties of children,one only is recorded by Herodotus, which appearssingular and unjust ; that if a son was unwillingto maintain his parents, he was at liberty to refuse;but that a daughter, on the contrary, was compelledto assist them, and, on refusal, was amenable tolaw. We may, however, question the truth ofthis statement of the historian ; and, drawing aninference from the marked severity t of filial dutiesamong the Egyptians, some of which we finddistinctly alluded to in the sculptures of Thebes,we may conclude, that in Egypt much more wasexpected from a son than in any civilised nation ofthe present day; and that this was not confined tothe lower orders, but extended to those of thehighest ranks of society. And if the office of fan-bearerwas an honourable post, and the sons of theThis does not agree with Diodorus's account of the superiority ofthe wife.

TheEuropean nations were not long in altering theirearly habits, and this custom soon became disregarded; but a respect for ancient institutions, andthose ideas, so prevalent in the East, which rejectall love of change, prevented the Egyptians fromdiscarding the usages of their ancestors ; and wefind this and many other primitive customs retained,even at the period when they were mosthighly civilised.In the education of youth they were particularlystrict; and "they knew," says Plato f, "thatchildren ought to be early accustomed to suchgestures, looks, and motions as are decent andproper ; and not to be suffered either to hearor learn any verses and songs than those whichVide supra, plate 1., and p.72.f Plato, second book of laws.CHAP.

They particularlyinculcated respect for old age ; and the factof this being required towards strangers, necessarilyargues a great regard for the person of a parent ;for we are informed * that, like the Lacedaemonian,they required every young man to give place to hissuperiors in years, and even, if seated, to rise ontheir approach t : and surely, if they were expectedto reverence age alone, how much more must havebeen considered due to their parents, to whomthey were so deeply indebted ?Nor were these honours limited to their lifetime:the memory of parents and ancestors was reveredthrough succeeding generations : their tombs weremaintained with the greatest respect, liturgies wereperformed by their children t, or by priests at theirexpense, and we have previously seen what advantagewas taken of this feeling, in the laws concerningdebt.RESPECT TO THEIR MONARCHS.Guided by the same principle, the Egyptianspaid the most marked respect to their monarch,as the father of his people. He was obeyed withcourteous submission, his will was tantamount to aHerodot. ii. 80.-f- As the Jews, " thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, andhonour the face of the old man."

" For of allpeople," says Diodorust, " the Egyptians retainthe highest sense of a favour conferred upon them,and deem it the greatest charm of life to make asuitable return for benefits they have received."Through this impulse, they were induced to solemnisethe funeral obsequies of their kings withunparalleled magnificence ; and to this the historianalso attributes the unexampled duration ofthe Egyptian monarchy. § Considering the highestimation in which the feeling of gratitude washeld among them, we cannot deny that the Egyptianswere fully capable of appreciating the advantagesof civilised habits, and that they cherishedone of the noblest ornaments of social life : " andhonour," adds the historian, " done to one whoAs in other countries where the ministers are responsible. Butthe conduct of the king was also subject to animadversion ; and, at thetime of his death, that of the monarch, and of every Egyptian, underwenta severe scrutiny, and the usual funeral honours were sometimesdenied them.

Nor did it consist inmere outward show : the mourning continued forseventy two days, during which time every oneabstained from the comforts as well as the luxuriesof life. Meat, wheat bread, wine, and all delicacieswere voluntarily renounced ; and they neitheranointed themselves, nor indulged in the bath, norin any kind of pleasure.UNIFORMITY OF THEIR LAWS.Another remarkable feature of the Egyptianlaws was the sanctity with which old edicts wereupheld. They were closely interwoven with thereligion of the country *, and said to be derivedfrom the Gods themselves ; whence it was consideredboth useless and impious to alter such sacredinstitutions. Few innovations were introduced bytheir monarchs, unless loudly called for by circumstancesJ and we neither read of any attempts onthe part of the people to alter or resist the laws,nor on that of their rulers to introduce a morearbitrary mode of government. fAs the Jewish and Moslem laws.t Herodotus' account of the tyranny of Cheops in building the pyramidcannot be received with any degree of credit.F 370 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. IV.DIFFERENT LAWGIVERS.As society advances, it must, however, necessarilyhappen that some alterations are requisite, eitherin the reformation of an existing code, or in theintroduction of additional laws ; and among thedifferent legislators of the Egyptians, are particularlynoticed the names of Nevis, Sashes, Se-nostrils,Bocchoris, Psychic, Amasis, and even thePersian Darius. The great merit of the first ofthese seems to have consisted in inducing thepeople to conform to those institutions, which hepretended to have received from Hermes, theEgyptian Mercury * ; *' an idea," says Diodorus,which has been adopted with success by manyother ancient lawgivers, who have inculcated a respectfor their institutions, through the awe that isnaturally felt for the majesty of the Gods." Theadditions made by Sashes chiefly related to mattersof religious worship ; and Sesostris, in additionto numerous regulations of a military nature, is saidto have introduced some changes into the agriculturalsystem ; and having divided all the land ofEgypt, with the exception of that which belongedto the priests and soldiers, into squares of equalareas t, he assigned to each peasant his peculiarDiod. i. di.■[ Herodot. ii. 109.

Of the laws of Bocchoris and Psychicrespecting debt, I have already spoken %-, and theformer is said to have introduced many others relatingto the kings, as well as to civil contracts andcommerce §, and to have established several importantprecedents in Egyptian jurisprudence.Amasis was particularly eminent for his wisdom,and for the many salutary additions he made to thelaws of his country. He remodelled the systemof provincial government, and defined the dutiesof the monarchs with peculiar precision ; and,though not of royal extraction II, his conduct inthe management of affairs was so highly approvedby the people, that their respect for him wasscarcely inferior to that shown to his most gloriouspredecessors.

The Oasis of Ammon was not, of course, in Egypt.Bv the " two Oases" he probably means those of El Charge ande'bakhleh, the great and the western Oasis, rather than the former andthe little Oasis.J Thebes and the land around it composed two nomes, one on theeast and the other on the west bank : the former called " Theatrummomus," the latter " Pathyrites," which probably derived its namefrom Athyr, who is so frequently said in the sculptures to be the presidentof that side of the river.§ This, as usual, involves the question concerning Remeses theGreat ; and it is difficult to decide, whether we ought to attribute theactions recorded of Sesostristo this monarch of the 18th, or to anotherof a previous dynasty. Vide supra, vol. i. p. 74.CHAP. IV. GOVERNORS OF PROVINCES. 75the organisation of the provinces had already beenmade, and that this was one of the first plans suggestedfor the government of the country.The office of monarch was at all times of thehighest importance, and to his charge were committedthe management of the lands, and all mattersrelating to the internal administration of thedistrict. * He regulated the assessment and levyingof the taxes, the surveying of the lands, the openingof the canals, and all other agricultural interestsof the country, which were under the immediatesuperintendence of certain members of the priestlyorder ; and, as his residence was in the chief townof the nome t, all causes respecting landed property,and other accidental disputes, were referredto him, and adjusted before his tribunal. Thedivision of the country into thirty-six parts, ornomes, continued to be maintained till a lateperiod, since in Strabo's time the number was stillthe same ; ten, says the geographer, being assignedto the Thebaid, ten to the Delta, and sixteen § tothe intermediate province : though some changeswere afterwards introduced both in the nomes andprovinces of Egypt. The nomes, he adds, wereThe Turkish system of ruling Egypt was by twenty-four beys(bees) or governors of districts, under whom were the ashes andqymaqams. The number of beys is now no longer twenty-four, as inthe time of the Memlooks.-|- This agrees with the definition of a nome given by St. Cyril ofAlexandria : " A nome, according to the Egyptians, includes a city, itssuburbs, and the villages within the district." Cellar, ii. lib. iv. 6, 7.We are not, however, to understand that the word nome is Egyptian.t Strabo, lib. xvii.§ These were the sixteen prefecture which, according to Pliny,assembled in the Labyrinth. Lib. 36.76 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. IV.subdivided into toparchise, or local governments,and these again into minor jurisdictions ; and wemay conclude, that the three offices of monarchs,monarchs, and the third or lowest grade, answeredto those of bey, ashes, and qymaqam of the presentday. The distinctive appellation of eachnome, in later times at least, was derived from thechief town, where the governor resided, and therank of each monarch depended on the extent ofhis jurisdiction. But of the state of Egypt in theearly period of its history we have little or no information; owing to the uncivilised condition ofneighbouring states, to the indifference of thoseGreeks who visited it, or to the loss of their writings,and above all to the jealousy of the Egyptians *towards foreigners, to whom little or no informationwas imparted respecting the institutions andstate of the country.Like the Chinese, they prevented all strangersfrom penetrating into the interior ; and if anyGreek was desirous of becoming acquainted withthe philosophy of their schools, he was tolerated,rather than welcomed, in Egypt ; and those whotraded with them were confined to the town ofNaucratis t, in the same manner that EuropeansStrabo, lib. xvii.f The Egyptians pretending to grant a privilege to this town,obliged all Greek traders to repair to it. (Herodot. ii. 179.) The Turksconfined European ambassadors in the Seven Towers for their protection.The Ionian and Marian troops of Psamaticus had a place assignedto them a little below Bubastis, called " the camp," and were afterwardsremoved by Amasis to Memphis. Herodotus says they were thefirst foreigners who were allowed to settle in the country. Herodot.ii. 154.CHAP. IV. GOVERNORS OF PROVINCES. 77are now obliged to live in the Frank quarter ofa Turkish, or a Chinese, city. And when, afterthe time of Amasis and the Persian conquest,foreigners became better acquainted with thecountry, its ancient institutions had begun to losetheir interest, and the Egyptians mourned undera victorious and cruel despot. Herodotus, it istrue, had ample opportunity of examining the stateof Egypt during his visit to the country ; but hehas failed to give us much insight into its lawsand institutions ; and little can be gleaned fromany author, except Diodorus, who, at least, deservesthe credit of having collected, under far less favourablecircumstances, much curious information uponthis interesting subject.Strabo mentions some of the offices which existedin Egypt in his time ; but, though he assertsthat many of them were the same as under thePolemics, we are by no means certain that theyanswer to those of an earlier period. " Under theparch," says the geographer, " who holds therank of a king, is the dicaeodotes, that is, thelawgiver or chancellor, and another officer, whois called the privy-purse, or private accountant,whose business it is to take charge of every thingthat is left without an owner *, and which falls ofright to the emperor. These two are also attendedby freedmen and stewards of Caesar, whoare entrusted with affairs of greater or less magnitude.. . . But of the natives who are employed inthe government of the different cities, the principalThe Bay el mal, or " the property office," of the present day.78 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP.

New regulations were adopted tosuppress the turbulent spirit of the times : theStrabo, lib. xvii. This officer answers to the Bash-agha of modernEgypt, who goes the rounds of the town at night, and is the chief ofthe police.CHAP. IV. POLITICAL CHANGES. 79government, no longer content with the mild officeof protector, assumed the character of chastiser ofthe people : and Egypt was ruled by a militaryforce, rendered doubly odious, from being, in agreat measure, composed of foreign mercenaries.The cast of soldiers had lost its consequence, itsprivileges were abolished, and the harmony onceexisting between that order and the people wasentirely destroyed. Respect for the wisdom ofthe sacerdotal order, and the ancient institutions ofEgypt, began to decline : and the influence oncepossessed by the priests over the public mind couldonly be traced in the superstitious reverence shownby fanatics to the rites of a religion, now muchcorrupted and degraded by fanciful doctrines ; andif they retained a portion of their former privileges,by having the education of youth intrusted to them,as well as the care of the national records, thesuperintendence of weights and measures, the surveyingof the lands, and the equal distribution ofthe annual payments, they lost their most importantoffices — the tutelage and direction of the councilsof government, and the right of presiding at thecourts of justice.The provincial divisions of Egypt varied at differenttimes, particularly after the Roman conquest.The country, as already stated, consistedoriginally of two parts. Upper and Lower Egypt ;afterwards of three, the Thebaid : Heptanomis, orMiddle Egypt : and the Delta, or Lower Egypt :but Heptanomis, in the time of Arcades, the sonof Theodosius the Great, received the name ofJ80 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. IV.Arcadia ; and the eastern portion of the Delta,about the end of the fourth century, was formedinto a separate province called Augustamnica *,itself divided into two parts. The Thebaid wasalso made to consist of Upper and Lower, the lineof separation passing between Panopolis andPtolemaic Herraii.tUnder the Romans t, Egypt was governed bya prasfectj or Parch, aided by three officers, whosuperintended the departments of justice, revenue,and police, throughout the country, the inferiorcharges being chiefly filled by natives. Over eachof the provinces a military governor was appointed,who was " subordinate to the prefect in all civilaffairs §, though frequently intruding on his jurisdiction,when it was necessary to use militarycoercion in the collection of the taxes. Thischarge, together with the superintendence of thetribunals, and the duty of denouncing unjustjudges, (but more particularly the collection, andtransmission to Constantinople, of that part of thetaxes which was paid in grain,) where still vested inthe prefect.Thus far it does not appear that there vereany very serious defects in the organisation of thegovernment of Egypt : but the same authoritywhence these facts are chiefly drawn (the Theodosiancode,) furnishes us with still more ample deitseems also to have encroached upon Heptanomis.-f- Vide Danville's Memoires sur I'Egypte, p. 32.j Vide supra, vol. ii. p. 72.^ For the foUowhig observations I am indebted to Mr. Hamilton'svaluable work ^gvptiaca, p. 231., to which I refer the reader.CHAP. IV. EGYPT UNDER THE ROMANS. 81tails on the nature of the subordinate institutions,both at Alexandria and in the rest of the country.And here the whole system seems to have beenfounded in error, and persevered in with a blindobstinacy, which preferred the accumulation ofmany bad and unjust laws to the repeal of a fewwhich were imperfect.The decurions of Alexandria soon found thatthe honour bestowed upon them was to be paid forat the highest rate. In return for their nominaland titular privileges, and in addition to the chargeof supplying the inhabitants with provisions, ofkeeping the records, and preserving the police ofthe city, they were subjected to continual expensesfor the public games and shows ; presents for honoraryseats were arbitrarily demanded of them, andthe office was converted from a benefit to a burden.Some were reduced to poverty by thesemeans : the expenses they were no longer able tobear were attached to the succeeding proprietor oftheir estates : others assumed dishonourable employments,or became the slaves of persons in power ;and laws were no sooner enacted to obviate theseelusive steps, than all contrivances were inventedon the part of the sufferers to facilitate them.In the public distress, private gifts and loanshad been solicited by government ; these were soonconverted into forced contributions ; and the chargeof levying them added to the burdens of the decurions.Immunities against such contributions werepurchased at one time, and repealed by public orderswhen the money had been paid.VOL. 11. G82 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. IV.'* That the municipal administrations of the differenttowns were not better protected against theabuses of a corrupt government, is evident fromtwo laws preserved in the same code, one of whichwas enacted to recall the decurions who had quittedthe duties of their office, and, among these, allwho had taken refute amongst the anchorites ofthe desert. By the other law, the right of reclaimingtheir property was denied to all who had abandonedit for the purpose of avoiding the duties towhich it was liable.*' Throughout the villages, and the farms surroundingthem, the triple division of the produceamong the priests, the military, and the cultivators,had ceased with the Greek conquest. Tothis had succeeded a regular establishment of officers,who had severally the charge of collectingthe tribute due from each proprietor, that of preservingthe peace of the village, and that of superintendingthe maintenance of the dykes and canal,so important a part of the rural economy of Egypt.A fixed sum of money had been, from the first, setapart for this object ; and a regular system hadbeen long established, and strictly adhered to, forthe mode in which repairs were to be made, thetime or state of the inundation at which the principalembankments were to be opened, and forcarrying into execution other precautionary measuresof irrigating and of draining, which the physicalorganisation of the country had renderednecessary.In the edicts of Justinian are to be traced someCHAP. IV. EGYPT UI-JDER THE ROMANS. 83important alterations, introduced by that emperorinto the civil government of the country. Theprovince of Augustamnica appears to have beenunited to that of Egypt and Alexandria; and fromthis last, the two districts of Maraeotis andMenelaswere detached and added to Libya, for the avowedand singular reason, that, without them, this latterprovince would be unable to defray the expensesof its government.The civil and military powers were again unitedin the same person, both in Egypt and the thebaid,as they had been before the reign of Constantine; and the magistrates of the provinces ornomes, now called patriarchs, and those of the villages,or the pagarchs, were placed under theirauthority. The functions of these magistrates,when they were once named to the office, mightbe suspended by the prefects, but they could notbe definitively removed without orders from Constantinople.*' The main, and almost the sole, object that appearsto have dictated these edicts of Justinian,was the more punctual transmission of grain to thecapital of the empire. Whether it was owing tothe increasing poverty of the country, the connivanceof the different agents employed in theservice, or the corruptions of those in the higheroffices of state, perpetual difficulties seem to haveoccurred. But what argues on the part of theRoman government a conviction of the necessityof cultivating, by a mild treatment, the nativeEgyptians, all the menaces held out against theG 284 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. IV.disobedience of the imperial orders are directedagainst the prefects, who alone are held responsible,in their persons and their effects, for the strict executionof them. In some instances a denunciationis published against the higher orders of theclergy, who, by unauthorised acts of protection,shall have pretended to release any individualsfrom the payments to which they were subject.*' The state of property in Egypt continued,under the Romans, very similar to what it had beenin the earliest times. The proprietor of a district,or of a certain part of it, had a kind of feudal claimover his vassals, from whose gratuitous labour heexacted all that was not absolutely necessary fortheir existence. While Egypt retained its independenceit was fully sufficient to supply its ownwants ; but, as a province, it suffered all the evilsof a corrupt and vicious administration ; and it neverreceived any returns, in money or kind, for itsannual supply of grain to the capital. As this supplydid not diminish, but rather increased in aninverse proportion to the means which were tofurnish it, the proprietors, when obliged to add totheir demands upon the peasants, found them inasituation to afford less. Industry was at a stand;and the distressed serfs had no other method ofevading such claims, than either by abandoningtheir farms for others more favourably situated, orby seeking the protection of some powerful individual,whose patronage they purchased. Thisabuse had been the natural consequence of thesystem of honours established by Constantine ; andCHAP. IV. EGYPT UNDER THE ROMANS. 85in Egypt it was productive of the most prejudicialeffects. The evil grew rapidly : what was firstdictated by necessity was soon resorted to bychoice ; and, when necessity could not be pleadedin excuse, temptations were not wanting on thepart of the protectors, who soon found the meansof converting their powers of granting privilegesinto a pecuniary speculation ; and the next stepwas that the proprietors, being abandoned by theirvassals, and, consequently, reduced to poverty, wereobliged to yield up their estates to those who hadsucceeded in seducing them. This iniquitous trafficparticularly prevailed among the military ; andfor some years the new possessors were able to disguisefrom the government the truth of their situation,by paying no taxes from the estates they hadthus procured, and by returning as defaulters thenames of those whom they had ejected.** Various laws, from tire time of Constantine toTheodosius the Second and Justinian, were enactedagainst these grievances ; they successively increasedin severity; and nothing but the extremestrigour, and the attachment of responsibility on theperson of the prefects themselves, could succeedin putting an end to them. At first, the peasantswho remained behind were to make up for whatthe fugitives ought to have paid. Afterwards, anignominious punishment was denounced againstsuch fugitives, and the protectors sentenced to afine : — this fine was gradually augmented to a sumequal to the whole fortune of the delinquent.Theodosius the Second, finally established all suchG 386 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. IV.usurpations of property as had taken place in thismanner, prior to the consulate of Cacsarius andAttics, and ordered the immediate restitution ofall that had taken place since that period, subjecting,at the same time, the new proprietors to allthe ancient charges and contributions attached totheir estates, including those that would have fallenon the fugitive as well as the other vassals.The peculiar nature of the soil and locality ofEgypt had fixed, at a very early period, the systemof agriculture, the most congenial to them. Noinnovations appear to have been introduced on thishead ; and, as laws have only been made wherechanges were thought necessary, we are left withoutany other materials, whence we might form ourjudgment relative to the employment of the soil inancient times, beyond those customs which havebeen handed down to the present age.** Agriculture was always the principal object towhich the government of Egypt was directed; andwhen the king, the priests, and the military, hadeach an equal share in the produce of the soil, thecommon interest would effectually prevent anyabuses in the management of it. But, under aforeign yoke, these interests were too divided; andthe defects of administration were to be supplied bythe rigour of the laws. The destroyer of a dykewas, at one time, to be condemned to the publicworks and to the mines ; at another, to be branded,and transported to the Oasis, — punishments moresevere than are ever thought of even under thepresent Mahometan government.CHAP. IV. EGYPT UNDER THE ROMANS. 87Some laws were made for the encouragementof the growth of timber trees in Egypt, but thesame misguided policy, which had failed in so manyother laws, preferred the menaces of a punishmentfor the sale or the use of the sycamore and napka *,rather than the offer of a reward for extendingplantations of them. Here may be traced the samehand which, instead of ameliorating the situationof the oppressed peasantry, was contented withaccumulating upon the fugitives useless punishments,or bringing them to their homes by anarmed force.With respect to the amount of the public revenuesof Egypt, Diodorus Stimulus states them tohave been, in his time, equal to six thousandtalents, or about one million two hundred thousandpounds: and, notwithstanding the much higheramount stated by Strabo, we may conclude that inno future period they exceeded this sum. Thedisorders to which the people were subjectedunder its last kings would have tended rather todiminish its means of contribution ; and, underthe Roman government, its wealth and resourcesmust have proceeded in an inverse ratio to thedemands from the capital. Augustus, indeed,relieved Egypt from one cause of oppression,whereby Sicily and Sardinia had successively beenruined, — the presence and controlling authorityof powerful Romans.The levying of the taxes, both in money and inRhamnus Nabeca : in Arabic, neb or sir.

IV.kind, appears to have been left to the immediatecare of the natives, whereof one or more presidedover each district and village ; these, however,were successively placed under the superintendenceof the prefects of Egypt, the governors of theThebaid, and the military force ; and the responsibility,which at first rested with the superiorofficers, was afterwards extended to the soldiersthemselves.The tributes, in whatever form they were paid,were received at Alexandria bv Roman agents commissionedfor the purpose. After the time ofConstantine, it appears that the transport of thegrain was at the expense of a collective body ofthe principal inhabitants of that city. This burdenwas, at a later period, commuted for an annualpayment ; but the object was still subject to manydelays, till the edict of Justinian directed thecharge to be borne by the chief custom-houseofficer at Alexandria.Other expenses were also payable by individuals,in addition to the regular taxes of the country.The freight of the corn vessels down the Nile, thebaking; of the bread for the military, where theyhappened to be quartered, and the clothing of thetroops, became so many occasions of extortion.It is difficult to fix the precise portion of theentire taxes of Egypt which was paid, whether ingrainor in money, anterior to the reign of Justinian.Ashen this emperor framed an edict expresslyfor the purpose of regulating the transmission ofthe grain to the capital, and of facilitating the levyingof the rest of the taxes, the quantity of cornCHAP. IV. EGYPT UNDER THE ROMANS. 89then furnished by Egypt to Constantinople waseight hundred thousand arrange, which, if calculatedas equal to the ardea of the present day*, amountto four hundred and fifty thousand quarters ; andas, by the same law, a fine of three solidi for everythree artaban was to attach to all who, by neglectof their duty, should occasion any delay in thecollection, the value of each artaban may be takenat one third of this sum, or about seven shillings ;consequently, that of the corn annually sent toConstantinople would have been nearly three thousandpounds sterling ; and, perhaps, a quantitynot much inferior to this was detained in thecountry for the supply of the prefect's palace, themaintenance of the troops, and the gratuitous distributionsof corn granted to Alexandria by Diocletian,and confirmed and augmented by otheremperors.There would still, however, remain a large portionof the public revenues to be paid in money.*' One chief source of misunderstanding amongthe governors and the governed throughout Egypt,and of the occasional oppression of the latter, was,that the system of regulating the taxes of each provinceof the empire, once for each successive termof fifteen years, was unwisely extended to Egypt.This indiction, which was introduced by Constantinein lieu of the lustrum, or term of five years,however convenient it might be for other countries,was ill adapted to one wherein the produce ofeach year must so essentially depend on the extentof the inundation. One consequence of this was,In the year 1800.90 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. IV.that frequently the prefects were obliged to returndifferent estates as totally deficient, which opened adoor to endless acts of corruption and connivance.*' The obligations imposed on the prefect for thepunctual supply of grain, were much more rigorousthan those which related to the payments to bemade in specie to the imperial treasury ; so thathe was enabled, from time to time, to desist fromhis pecuniary demands upon the people, the betterto enable them to bring in the stated quantity ofcorn ; but this pretext likewise led the way to infiniteabuses. Although the payments in moneyought to have equalled two thirds of that in kind,Justinian complains, in his edict, that they werefrequently reduced to nothing, wholly absorbed inpretended expenses, and pillaged by the secret understandingof the Egyptian tax-gatherers and thepublic agents. It is scarcely possible to conceivethe moral weakness of a government which knewnot how to put a stop to evils of this nature, withallthe military means of the empire at their disposal,and no ostensible resistance to their operationsbut the bare principle of corruption. Thesedeductions from the tax demanded by the government,which nearly equalled their amount, appearthe more extraordinary, as we find in the same edictof Justinian, that, throughout every village anddistrict, the inhabitants were liable to other callsfor the maintenance of the canals and dykes, publicbuildings, and the salaries of subaltern agents.** The author* of the essay from which the greaterReynicr, L'Egypte sous les Romains, 1807.CHAP. IV. EGYPT UNDER THE ROMANS. 91part of these observations are taken, is induced tosuggest, whether the public accountants of thosetimes may not have acted on the system now pursuedunder the Turkish establishment ; who makean annual charge of near thirty thousand livres forthe transport of the dirt and rubbish of Cairo tothe seacoast, while it is notorious that not a singleboat is employed upon this service.The duties of export and import in Egypt,which must have formed a considerable part of therevenue, particularly as long as it continued the emporiumof goods between Europe and India, appearto have been farmed to Greeks and Romans, contraryto the system adopted with regard to the taxon land. These duties were payable on the coastof the Red Sea, at Canopus, and at Alexandria. Atthis latter place, the persons by whom they werefarmed had so many opportunities of granting atemporary relief to the necessitous, in advancingmoney for them, that the vexations they could afterwardspractise upon their debtors form the subjectof one of the heads of Justinian's edict ; and it wasin consideration of the profits enjoyed by the samepersons, that they were liable to the expenses of thetransport of grain from their port to the capital.The corporation of Alexandria were releasedby the same emperor from the repairs of the canalwhich brought them water from the Nile ; and theywere allowed four hundred solidi out of a fundcalled Dominium Vertical which, by the explanationwhich follows, appears to refer to the dutieslevied upon the ships frequenting the harbour ; andit was natural that those should pay a full portionTHE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. IV.of the expenses which procured them this necessarysupply. Besides taxes upon the industry, thetrades, and houses of its inhabitants, Alexandriawas, from time to time, subjected to a contributionunder the name of coronation money. This abusehad arisen out of the custom, once so laudable anduseful, of presenting, in the name of the provinces,crowns of gold to proconsuls, or other commanders,who had acted honourably and liberally during theirgovernments. This gradually became so general,that those who were not thus honoured consideredthemselves as insulted ; and, under the emperors, itwas soon converted from an honour into a means ofraising money. And in addition to the amount demandedfrom each, grievous in itself to a sufferingpeople, it became much more so by the irregularityand sudden manner in which it was imposed." *For many other interesting remarks on the state of Egypt aboutthis period, vide ^gyptiaca, p. 243.No. 92.A Captive secured by a liandcufj:CHAP.

The priests may have taughtthem that their stay in this world was of short duration; that their present abodes were only inns atwhich they reposed during their earthly pilgrimaget ; and that their tombs alone could be .i. 51.f As Jacob said to Pharaoh, " The days of my pilgrimage are 1.30years." Gen. xlvii. 9.94 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. V.ordered as everlasting habitations*, which it was areligious duty to adorn. It was their interest toinculcate similar notions : the persons employedin making and decorating the tombs were of thesacerdotal order ; and the splendour of funeral obsequiestended to their emolument. They inducedthem to expend considerable sums on the celebrationof those rites ; and many, \vho had barelysufficient to obtain the necessaries of life, wereanxious to save something for the expenses of theirdeath. For besides the embalming process, whichsometimes cost a talent of silver t, or about twohundred and listy pounds English money, the tombitself was purchased at an immense sum ; andnumerous demands were afterwards made uponthe estate of the deceased, for the celebration ofprayers, and other services for the soul. We cannot,however, suppose, that temporary gratificationwas denied to the rich of any class, or was deemedunworthy the wisdom of the priesthood ; and theyevidently enjoyed all the comforts and luxurieswhich their means could so well provide. Thoughthe priests may have kept up an external appearanceof self-denial, and avoided all unnecessary displayof wealth, it is natural that they should welcomethe blessings of this life, provided they did notinterfere with the practice of virtue. And if theytaught others to avoid ostentation, if they themselvessubmitted, on some occasions, to severeDiodor. loc. cit.f Diodor. i. 91.

As is usuallythe case in hot climates, many of the streets werenarrow, and few, except the principal ones, wherelarge enough to allow the passage of a chariot. InThebes, however, it is probable they were on asomewhat larger scale, and proportionate with theincreased size of the houses, some of which, evenin the early age of its founder, are said to havebeen four or five stories in height.*In towns built at the mouths of mountain ravines,the main street was, at the same time, the bed ofthe torrent : several instances of which may be seenin Spain and Italy ; and, as storms of rain seldomlast long in the arid climate of Egypt, the communicationby it was rarely impeded, or its surfaceDioJor. i. 45. The greater number I believe to have been confinedto one or two stories. At Rome they had three. Augustusconfined the height of houses to 70 feet.96 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. V.materially impaired. Indeed, if much rain hadfallen in that country, it would have been necessaryto construct houses of materials more capable ofresisting its effects than mere crude brick ; and,from the narrowness of some of the ravines, theirfoundations would have been in danger, as well asthe lives of the inhabitants. But heavy rain wasa rare phenomenon in Upper Egypt; and thoughmuch fell about the sea-coast of the Delta, and,during winter, in the interior of the eastern desertaviolent storm at Thebes was looked upon to presagean approaching calamity.*The use of crude brick, baked in the sun, wasuniversal in Upper and Lower Egypt, both forpublic and private buildings ; and the brick-fieldgave abundant occupation to numerous labourersthroughout the country. These simple materialswere found to be peculiarly suited to the climate ;and the ease, rapidity, and cheapness with whichthey were made, offered additional recommendations.Inclosures of gardens or granaries, sacredcircuits encompassing the courts of temples, wallsof fortifications and towns, dwelling-houses andtombs, in short, all but the temples t themselves,were of crude brick ; and so great was the demand,that the Egyptian government, observing the pro-herodotussays, " rain never falls at Thebes ; but before the Persianinvasion it rained violently." (lib. iii. 10.) The historian is not, however,borne out by fact, as we see from the appearance of the watercoursesthere, which were formed long before his time, and from thepains taken by the ancient Egyptians to protect their tombs and othermonuments from rain. A continued storm of heavy rain during a wholeday and night would be a rare occurrence ; but showers fall about five orsix times in the course of a wear at Thebes. Vide my Egypt and Thebes,p. 75.f Some small temples in the villages were of crude brick.CHAP. V. BRICKS A GOVERNMENT MONOPOLY. 9?fit which would accrue to the revenue from a monopolyof them, undertook to supply the public at amoderate price, thus preventing all unauthorisedpersons from engaging in their manufacture. And,in order more effectually to obtain their end, theseal of the king, or of some privileged person, wasstamped upon the bricks at the time they were made.This fact, though not positively mentioned by anyancient author, is inferred from finding bricks somarked, both in public and private buildings ; somehaving the ovals of a king, and some the nameand titles of a priest, or other influential person ; andit is probable that those which bear no characters,belonged to individuals who had obtained a permissionor license from government, to fabricatethem for their own consumption.The employment of numerous captives, whoworked as slaves, enabled the government to sell thebricks at a lower price than those who had recoursesolely to free labour ; so that, without the necessityof a prohibition, they speedily became an exclusivemanufacture ; and we find that, independentof native labourers, a great many foreigners wereconstantly engaged in the brick-fields at Thebes,and other parts of Egypt. The Jews, of course,were not excluded from this drudgery ; and, likethe captives detained in the Thebaid, they werecondemned to the same labour in Lower Egypt.They erected granaries, treasure cities, and otherpublic buildings for the Egyptian monarch : thematerials used in their construction were the workof their hands ; and the constant employment ofVOL. II. H98 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. V.brick-makers may be accounted for by the extensivesupply required, and kept by the governmentfor public sale.To meet with Hebrews in the sculptures cannotreasonably be expected, since the remains in thatpart of Egypt where they lived have not been preserved; but it is curious to discover other foreigncaptives occupied in the same manner, overlookedby similar " taskmasters *," and performing thevery same labours as the Israelites described in theBible ; and no one can look at the paintings ofThebes, representing brick-makers, without a feelingof the highest interest. Tliat the scene in the accompanyingwood-cut t is at the capital of UpperEgypt is shown by the hieroglyphics t, which expresslystate, that the ** bricks " (tohi^ are made fora"building at Thebes;" and this occurrence ofthe word implying bricks, similar both in modernArabic § and ancient Coptic, gives an additionalvalue to the picture.It is scarcely fair to argue, in defiance of logic,that because the Jews made bricks, and the personshere introduced are so engaged, these must necessarilybe Jews : since the Egyptians and their captiveswere constantly required to perform the sametask ; and the great quantity made at all times maybeinferred from the number of buildings, whichstill remain, constructed of those materials : but itis worthy of remark, that more bricks bearing theFigs. 3 and 6 in the wood-cut, No. 93.;Vide wood-cut, next page.At e in the wood-cut, over^^. 9.Tob or too," in Arabic, " a brick :" in Coptic " toi."CHAP.

V.have been discovered, than of any other period :owing to the many prisoners of Asiatic nationsemployed by him, independent of his Hebrewcaptives.With regard to the features of foreigners frequentlyresembling the Jews, it is only necessary toobserve, that the Egyptians adopted the same characterfor all the inhabitants of Syria*, as may beseen in the sculptures of Karnak and other places,where those people occur, or in one of the sets offigures in Belong's tomb ; and the brick-makers, farfrom having the very Jewish expression found inmany of those figures, have not even the beard, somarked in the people of Syria and the prisoners ofSheshonk ; and from the names of the captivesthroughout the tomb where they are found, it isevident they belong to a nation living far to thenorth of Judaea.Houses of a small size were usually connectedtogether, and formed the continuous sides ofstreets ; they rarely exceeded two stories, and manyof them consisted only of a ground floor, and anupper set of rooms. Nor, indeed, judging fromthe sculptures, do the Egyptians appear to havepreferred lofty houses; and, as in modern Egyptiantowns, the largest seldom had more, oban threestories. Those of the rich citizens frequentlycovered a considerable space t, and presented toHerodotus also calls the Jews Syrians, ii. 159.f At Thebes, the largest houses seem to have been on the Libyanside and in that part of Diospolis between Karnak and Luqsor; butthose in the immediate vicinity of the great temple stood in a moredense mass.

Their plans wereregular, the rooms being usually arranged round anopen area *, or on either side of a long passage towhich an entrance court led from the street. t Thecourt was an empty space, considerably larger thanthe Roman impluvium, probably paved with stone,or containing a few trees, a small tank t, or afountain, in its centre § ; and sometimes, thoughrarely, a flight of steps led to the main entrancefrom without. II A court was frequently common- =^tz-i°t-No. 94.Plans of houses.to several houses ; and again, some of the largemansions stood detached, and had the advantageof several doors of entrance, on two or threedifferent sides.

Nor were the Egyptians singularin the custom of planting trees about their townhouses, as we find the same mentioned by Latinauthors at Rome itself. *The height of the portico was about twelve orfifteen feet, just exceeding that of the cornice ofthe door, which was only raised by its thresholdabove the level of the grounds On either sideof the main entrance was a smaller door, whichstood at an equal distance between it and the side-wall,and was probably intended for the servants,and those who came on business. On entering tby the porch, you passed into an open court paula,or hall), containing a mandate §, or receivingroom, for visitors. This building, supported bycolumns, decorated with banners, was closed onlyat the lower part by inter-columnar panels, overwhich a stream of cool air was admitted, andprotection from the rays of the sun was securedby an awning that covered it. II On the oppositeside of the court was another door, the approachto the mandate from the interior ; and the masterof the house, on the announcement of a stranger,came in that way to receive him. ^ Three doorsled from this court to another of larger dimen-Hor.

The sidechambers were frequently arranged on either sideof a corridor, others faced towards the court, andothers were only separated from the outer wallby a long passage.In the distribution of the apartments, numerousand different modes were adopted, according to circumstances; in general, however, the large mansionsseem to have consisted of a court and corridors, witha set of rooms on either side, not unlike many ofthose now built in oriental and tropical countries ;but, in order to give a better notion of the generalarrangement of the houses and streets in an Egyptiantown, I shall introduce the plan of an ancientcity near Tel el Amarna, which I believe to havebeen Alabastron t : a place erroneously transferredby geographers from the valley of the Nile to theeastern desert. The houses are in many placesquite destroyed, leaving few traces of their plans,or even of their sites; and the position of the townitself differs much from that of most Egyptiancities, being of very inconsiderable breadth, and ofdisproportionate length, extending upwards of twomiles and a quarter, though less than two thirds ofa mile broad.Judges, iii. 20-j- Vide plate 0.CHAP.

According to the scholiast of Aratus,the keys of Egyptian temples bore the figure ofa lion, from which chains were suspended having aheart attached to them ;" alluding, as he supposes,to the beneficial effects of the inundation, and theperiod of its commencement, when the sun wasin the sign leo ; but not only were keys so ornamented,— the extremity of the stone spoutswhich conveyed the water from the roofs of thetemples, projecting bosses upon the sides or handlesof vases *, the prows of boats, funeral stands orbiers, chairs, and numerous other objects of furniturewere decorated with the same favourite emblem.Every deity, figure, and symbol, were formerlypronounced by the speculations of antiquariesto be connected with the sun ; and allcapricorn, bulls, and scorpions were, with innocentsimplicity, referred to their first parents in thezodiac ; but we may venture to believe the choiceof the Egyptians was directed to an ornamentcommon and popular in every country, and at allages, without being under any obligation to theaccidental form of a constellation.At a later period, when iron came into generaluse, keys were made of that metal, and consistedof a long straight shank, about five inches in length.No. 103.

Rare woodswere also part of the tribute imposed on foreignnations conquered by the Egyptians ; and the sculpturesinform us that they supplied them withebony, and various other kinds, which were requiredfor useful or ornamental purposes.On the ground-floor of some houses, besides thestore-rooms, were receiving and sitting apartments;and the upper part of the building contained thosefor entertaining guests t, for sleeping, and, generallyspeaking, the family chambers. Though in theplans of their houses there is no indication of themill, it is reasonable to conclude it was either inone of the rooms on the ground-floor, or in a courtconnected with the house, as is usual at the presentday in Cairo and other towns of Egypt ; and weIn a tomb I found at Thebes, bearing the name of Amunoph I.Vide my Egypt and Thebes, p. 8L and 126.

It was not inEgypt alone that women were so employed : thecustom was prevalent also in Greece, in the daysof Homer t, and even among the Romans, as it stillis in the valley of the Nile, and in other easterncountries; and the Bible history distinctly states itto have been the duty of a maid-servant to grindcorn, in the houses of the Eg}^tians.§Their mills were of simple and rude construction.They consisted of two circular stones, nearly flat,the lower one fixed, while the other turned on apivot, or shaft, rising from the centre of that beneathit ; and the grain, descending through an aperture inthe upper stone, immediately above the pivot, graduallyunderwent the process of grinding as itpassed. It was turned by a woman, seated, and holdinga handle, fixed perpendicularly near the edge ;and the hand-mill adopted by the modern Egyptianpeasants is probably borrowed from, and similar ||Pliny saps, " There were no bakers at Rome till after the year380 from the building of the city.

The stone of which the hand-millswere made was usually a hard grit ; and thereis evidence, from an inspection of the site of Heliopolis,that the beds from which it is still taken,lying behind the mountains of the Mokuttum, nearCairo, were quarried by the inhabitants of that cityfor the same purpose ; and many of the larger millstones,which were usually of granite, have beenfound amidst the crumbled ruins of ancient towns.On the top of the house was a terrace, whichserved as well for a place of repose as for exerciseduring the heat ; since, being covered with a roofsupported by columns, the sun was excluded, and aNo. 108.Terrace of a house.1 4THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS.CHAP.

The ceilings were laid out in compartments,each having a pattern with an appropriateborder ; in many instances reminding us sostrongly of Greek taste, that we should feel surprisedto find them on monuments of the earlyperiods of the 18th and preceding dynasties, if therewas not authority for believing that the Greeksborrowed numerous devices from Egypt; andwe may ascribe to the same origin the scarab,the harpy, and several of the ornamental emblemson Greek and Etruscan vases.

They had alsotanks of water in different parts of the garden,which served for ornament, as well as for irrigation,when the Nile was low ; and on these, the masterof the house occasionally amused himself and128 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. V.friends, by an excursion in a pleasure-boat kept forthe purpose. But, like the Orientals of the presentday, or like people of the continent of Europe,who are incapable of understanding how the Englishcan row for their amusement, the Egyptianswere contented to sit or stand in the boat, whiletheir servants towed it round the lake ; and, protectedfrom the sun by a canopy, they felt additionalpleasure in the contrast of their own ease with thelabour of their menials.They also amused themselves by angling, andspearing fish in the ponds within their grounds ;and on these occasions they were generally accompaniedby a friend, or one or more membersof their family.The mode of laying out the house and groundsvaried according to circumstances. Some villaswere of considerable extent, and, besides the arableland belonging to them, the gardens occupied avery large space, as did the offices and otherbuildings attached to the house.Some large mansions appear to have been ornamentedwith propel and obelisks, like the templesthemselves ; it is even possible that part of the buildingmay have been consecrated to religious purposes,as the chapels of other countries, since wefind a priest engaged in presenting offerings at thedoor of the inner chambers; and, indeed, but fromthe presence of women, the form of the garden, andthe style of the porch, we should feel disposed toconsider it a temple rather than a place of abode.*Vide wood-cut, No. 1 16.CHAP.

V.accustomed to pass either in their hunting or militaryexpeditions, were small and simple, being onlyintended for their reception during the short stayof a few days ; but those erected in an enemy'scountry may rather be looked upon as forts, thanas simple mansions. JNIany, however, in provincesat a distance from Egypt, were of very large dimensions,and had probably all the conveniences ofspacious villas ; like those erected in later times bythe Polemics, on the confines of Abyssinia.In order to give an idea of the extent of some oftheir villas, it will be necessary to describe the planand arrangement of the different parts. * Aboutthe centre of the wall of circuit was the main entrance,and two side gates, leading to an open walkshaded by rows of trees. Here were spacious tanksof water, which faced the door of the right and leftwing of the house, and between them an avenue ledfrom the main entrance to the stables, and to whatmay be called the centre of the mansion. Afterpassing the outer door of the right wing, you enteredan open court with trees, extending quite round anucleus of inner apartments, and having a backentrance communicating with the garden. On theright and left of this court were six or more store-rooms,a small receiving or waiting room at twoof the corners, and at the other end the staircaseswhich led to the upper story. Both of the innerfacade were furnished with a corridor, supportedon columns, with similar towers and gateways.The interior of this wing consisted of twelve rooms,two outer and one centre court, communicating byride Plates 8. and 9.CHAP. V. FARM-YARD. 133folding gates ; and on either side of this last was themain entrance to the rooms on the ground-floor,and to the staircases leading to the upper story.At the back were three long rooms, and a gatewayopening to the garden, which contained avariety of fruit trees, a small summer-house, anda tank of water.The arrangement of the left wing was different.The front gate led to an open court, extending thewhole breadth of the facade of the building, andbacked by the wall of the inner part. Central andlateral doors thence communicated with anothercourt, surrounded on three sides by a set of rooms,and behind it was a corridor, upon which severalother chambers opened.This wing had no back entrance, and, standingisolated, the outer court extended entirely roundit ; and a succession of doorways communicatedfrom the court with different sections of the centreof the house, where the rooms, disposed, like thosealready described, around passages and corridors,served partly as sitting apartments, and partly asstore-rooms.FARM-YARD.The stables for the horses, and the coach-housesfor the travelling chariots* and plaustra^ were inthe centre, or inner part of the building ; but the" Joseph made ready his chariot." Gen. xlvi. 29. The differencebetween the plaustraand these chariots, or curricles, was that the latterwere drawn by horses, the former by oxen.-f- Vitruvius says, *' The stable, especially in the villa, should be inthe warmest place, and not with an aspect towards the fire, for if horsesare stalled near a fire their coats soon become rough ; hence those stallsare excellent which are away from the kitchen, in the open space towardsthe east."

Though enclosed separately, it waswithin the general wall of circuit, which surroundedthe land attached to the villa ; and a canal, bringingwater from the river, skirted it, and extendedalong the back of the grounds. It consisted oftwo parts : the sheds for housing the cattle, whichstood at the upper end, and the yard, where rowsof rings were fixed, in order to tie them whilefeeding in the day-time : and men always attended,and frequently fed them with the hand.XTj-LjruKa 120.Fig. 1.

TheseRooms for housing the grain, apparently vaultedwere filled through an aperture near the top, towhich the men ascended by steps, and the grainwhen wanted was taken out from a door at thebase, tSTEWARDS.The superintendence of the houses and groundswas intrusted to stewards t, who regulated thetillage of the land, received whatever was derivedfrom the sale of the produce, overlooked the returnsVitruvius,in like manner, recommends " the barn, hay room, mealroom, and mill, to be without the boundaries of the villa, being therebyrendered more secure from fire."

Indeed, in no country is artificial irrigationmore required than in the valley of theNile ; and, from the circumstance of the water ofthe inundation not being admitted into the gardens,they depend throughout the year on the supplyobtained from wells and tanks, or the vicinity of acanal.The mode of irrigation adopted by the ancientEgyptians was exceedingly simple, being merelythe shadoof y or pole and bucket of the presentday; and, in many instances, men were employedto water the best with pails, suspendedby a wooden yoke they bore upon their shoulders.No. 124.Men watering the ground with pots of water.Beni Hassan.The same yoke was employed for carrying otherthings, as boxes, baskets containing game andpoultry, or whatever was taken to market; andConf.

Indeed, if the foot machine mentionedby Philo was really a wheel turned by thefoot, it cannot have been a very great relief to thelabourer, and we must attach considerable blameto the priests for their indifference to the comfortsof the people, when we contemplate the grandeurof their public buildings, and consider the greatmechanical skill necessary for their erection.The Egyptians were not singular in this neglectof useful improvements, or in their disregard for thewaste of time and labour resulting from the use ofsuch imperfect means : the same may be observedamong the Greeks and Romans ; and those enlightenedpeople, who bestowed the greatest attentionupon ornamental objects, and who had arrivedat a high degree of excellence in the manufactureof jewellery, and several articles of household furniture,were contented to remain on the level ofbarbarous communities in the imperfect style ofmany ordinary implements. To workmen who devisedsome novelty for adding to the splendour of ahouse, or the decoration of the person, great inducementswere held out, by the certainty of immediatepatronage; and their ingenuity, confident of reward,was naturally directed to such inventions. TheseDiod. i. 34., and lib. v,, in treating of Spain. Strabo, xvii.140 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP.

All that was intended forexternal show, or was exposed to view*, was exquisitelyfinished ; but the keys and locks of thatdoor, whose panels, handles, and other externalparts, evinced no ordinary skill, were rude and imperfect: the latter, if they simply answered the purpose,satisfied ; the former failed to please, unlessthey promised to flatter the pride of their possessor,by commanding admiration. The same remarkapplies to the coarse and primitive construction ofthe Roman mills; and these may justly be comparedto the rude hydraulic mechanism of the ancientEgyptians. Nor are these cases without aparallel at the present day ; and every one, whovisits the continent of Europe, must be struck witha similar disregard to many improvements, which,though long since known, and evidently tending tocomfort, and a decrease of labour, still continue tobe looked upon with indifference, while inventionscontributing to display and luxury are adopted ontheir first appearance.Water-skins were also used for irrigation by theEgyptians, as well as for sprinkling the ground beforethe rooms or seats of the grandees t, and theyThis does not apply to Greek temples, where the parts concealedfrom the spectator were wrought with the same care as the most exposedfeatures.f A common custom in the East.CHAP.

The former might be looked upon asthe orchard, but similar enclosures being alsoallotted to other trees, they equally lay claim to thisname; we cannot therefore apply a fixed appellationto any part but the vineyard itself.Gardens are frequently represented in the tombsof Thebes and other parts of Egypt, many of whichare remarkable for their extent. The one, here introduced,is shown to have been surrounded by anNo. ir>0. — A large garden, with the vineyard and other separate enclosures, tanks of water and a.m,llhomp ■ Fro>r? she H work of Prof. liose/hn,.14-4 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. V.embattled wall, with a canal of water passing in frontof it, connected with the river. Between the canaland the wall, and parallel to them both, was a shadyavenue of various trees ; and about the centre wasthe entrance, through a lofty door, whose lintel andimposts were decorated with hieroglyphic inscriptions,containing the name of the owner of thegrounds, who in this instance was the king himself.In the gateway were rooms for the porter, andother persons employed about the garden, and, probably,the receiving room for visitors, whose abruptadmission might be unwelcome ; and at the back,a gate opened into the vineyard. The vines weretrained on a trellis work, supported by transverserafters resting on pillars ; and a wall, extendinground it, separated this part from the rest of thegarden. At the upper end were suites of rooms,on three different stories, and the windows lookingupon green trees, and inviting a draught of air,made it a pleasant retirement in the heat of summer.On the outside of the vineyard wall wereplanted rows of palm trees, which occurred againwith the dons along the whole length of the exteriorwall ; four tanks of water, bordered by a grassplot,where geese were kept, and the delicate flower ofthe lotus was encouraged to grow, served for theirrigation of the grounds ; and small kiosks or summerhouses, shaded with trees, stood near the water,and overlooked beds of flowers. The spaces containingthe tanks, and the adjoining portions of thegarden, were each enclosed by their respectiveseparate walls, and a small subdivision on eitherCHAP.

Rows of columns,supporting wooden rafters, divided the vineyardinto numerous avenues, which afforded great facilityfor communication from one end to the other, andretained a certain degree of moisture at the roots,by intercepting the rays of the sun.The columns were frequently coloured, and wereornamental as well as useful ; but many weresimple wooden pillars, supporting, with their forkedsummits, the poles that lay over them.

The mostsimple consisted merely of a bag, in which thegrapes were put, and squeezed, by means of twopoles turning in contrary directions : a vase beingplaced below to receive the falling juice. Themode of representing it in Egyptian sculpture isnot very intelligible, or in accordance with ournotions of perspective ; though we may easily understandthat the man at the top of the pictureis in the act of pushing the poles apart, in orderto stretch the bag, as a finale to the process,the poles being at that time in a horizontal position,and opposite to each other. Another press,nearly on the same principle, consisted of a bagAthenaeus, on the authority of Hellenic, sap's, " The vine wasfirst cultivated about PHnthine, a town of Egypt; to which circumstanceDion attributes the love of wine among the Egyptians," lib. i. 25. accordingto Strabo, it was grown in great abundance in the Mareotis andthe Arsinoite norse. lib. 17.-)- Numb.

In this thebag was retained in a horizontal position, one endfixed, the other passing through a hole in the oppositeside, and was twisted by means of a rod turnedwith the hand; the juice, as in the former, beingreceived into a vase beneath ; and within the framestood the superintendent, who regulated the quantityof pressure, and gave the signal to stop.\ViiK'i>Beni Hassan.Sometimes a liquid was heated on the fire, and,having been well stirred, was poured into the sackcontaining the grapes, during the process of pressure; but whether this was solely with a view ofobtaining a greater quantity of juice, by moisteningthe husks, or was applied for any other purpose,it is difficult to determine : the fact, however,of its being stirred while on the fire suffices toshow it was not simple water ; and the triturationof the fruit, while it was poured upon it, may suggestits use in extracting the colouring matter forred wine.The name molecular, by which the Romans designatedtheir press, would not be inapplicable to154 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. V.such a mode of twisting or squeezing out the juice ;but it appears that in this machine the grapes werecrushed beneath a wooden beam (presume), so thatthe process and principle were somewhat different ;and we learn from Vitruvius that the Roman torcularwas of two kinds, one turned by a screw, andthe other by levers.The two Egyptian addresses were used in allparts of the country, but principally in LowerEgypt, the grapes in the Thebaid being generallypressed by the feet. The footpress was also usedin the lower country ; and we even find the twomethods of pressing the grapes represented in thesame sculptures; it is not, therefore impossible tthat, after having been subjected to the foot, theymay have undergone a second pressure in thetwisted bag. This does not appear to have beenthe case in the Thebaid, where the footpress t isalways represented alone ; and the juice was allowedto run off by a pipe directly to an open tank.Some of the large presses were highly ornamented§, and consisted of at least two distinctparts : the lower portion or vat (lacus) : and theVirgg.

In Egypt, a resinous, or a bituminoussubstance is always found at the bottom of amphoraewhich have served for holding wine ; the Romans,according to Pliny*, employed the Brutal pitch,or resin of the pica pine, in preference to all others,for this purpose : and if, " in Spain, they used thatof the pinaster, it was little esteemed, on accountof its bitterness, and oppressive smell." In theEast, the terebinthus was considered to afford thebest resin, superior even to the mastic of the len-viscus; and the resins of Judaea and Syria onlyyielded in quality to that of Cyprus. This resinouscoating for the interior of amphorae was very generallyused by the Romans, and was one of thenumerous means t they had for preserving and improvingthe flavour! of wine ; and, besides smokingit, they sometimes boiled down a certain portion,which gave it a greater body, and insured itskeeping.The mode of arranging amphorae in an Egyptiancellar was similar to that adopted by the Greeks andRomans.

According to Athenseus, " the Mareoticgrape was remarkable for its sweetness," and thewine is thus described by him : " Its colour iswhite t, its quality excellent, and it is sweet and lightwith a fragrant bouquet ; it is by no means astringent,nor does it affect the head." But it was notfor its flavour alone that this wine was esteemed,and Strabo ascribes to it the additional merit ofkeeping to a great agent ** Still, however," saysAthenaeus, ** it is inferior to the Teniotic, a winewhich receives its name from a place called Tenia,"where it is produced. Its colour is pale and white,and there is such a degree of richness in it, thatwhen mixed with water it seems gradually to bediluted, much in the same way as Attic honeywhen a liquid is poured into it : and besides theagreeable flavour of the wine, its fragrance is sodelightful as to render it perfectly aromatic, andit has the property of being slightly astringent.There are many other vineyards in the valley ofthe Nile, whose wines are in great repute, and theseNear the Qasr Wharton.

The Sebennytict was likewise one of thechoice Egyptian wines ; but, from the position ofthat town and nome, we may infer that it differedgreatly in quality from those just mentioned, andthat it was inferior in body as well as flavour.Pliny, however, cites it among the best of foreignwines, and says it was made of three differentgrapes, a sort of Hassan, the cethalos, and peace.The Hassan grape he afterwards describes t as excellingall others in Egypt in sweetness, and asbeing remarkable for its medicinal effects.Another singular wine, called by Pliny ecbolada §(sx^oXa^), was also the produce of Egypt ; but,from its peculiar powers, we may suppose that menalone drank it, or at least that it was forbidden tonewly married brides.

In the earliest times, Egyptwas renowned for drugs *, and foreigners had recourseto that country for wines as well as herbs ;yet Apollodorus, the physician, in a treatise onwines, addressed to Ptolemy, king of Egypt, recommendedthose of Pontus as more beneficial thanany of his own country, and particularly praisedthe Peparethian t, produced in an island of the^gean Sea ; but he was disposed to consider it lessvaluable as a medicine, when its good qualities couldnot be discovered in six years.The wines of Alexandria and Coptos are alsoMark, XV. 23.

It was in the temple of Heliopolisalone that wine was totally forbidden in libations t,and when used by the priests in other places forthis purpose, says Plutarch, " they poured it on thealtars of the gods, as the blood of those enemieswho had formerly fought against them."

The same writer alsoaffirms, on the authority of Eudoxus, that it waswholly forbidden to the kings of Egypt, previousto the reign of Psamaticus ; and, though we mayfeel disposed to question the truth of this assertion *,there is every probability that they were on thesame footing in this respect as the priests, and thata certain quantity was allowed them, in accordance,as Hecatseus states, with the regulations of thesacred books The number of wines, mentioned inthe lists of offerings presented to the deities in thetombs or temples, varies in different places-eachappears with its peculiar name attached to it ; butthey seldom exceed three or four kinds, and amongthem I have observed, at Thebes, that of thenorthern country t,** which was, perhaps, fromMareotis, Anthylla, or the nome of Sebennytus.Private individuals were under no particular restrictionswith regard to its use, and women werenot forbidden it, whether married or single.

Such was the custom at the earliest periodsof Roman history ; and even at a later time prejudicepronounced it disgraceful for a woman to drinkwine ; and they sometimes saluted a female relationt, whom they suspected, in order to discover ifshe had secretly indulged in its use. It was afterwardsallowed them on the plea of health, and nobetter method could have been devised for removingthe restriction.The Egyptian women, as I have already observed,appear to have enjoyed greater privileges,and to have been treated with more courtesy on alloccasions, than in other ancient communities : andif they sometimes sat apart from the men, on anotherside of the same room, equal attentions were shownto them as to the other guests. That they werenot restricted in the use of wine §, and in the enjoymentof other luxuries, is evident from thefrescoes which represent their feasts ; and thepainters, in illustrating this fact, have sometimessacrificed their gallantry to a love of caricature.Some call the servants to support them as theyPlin. xiv. 13. f Ibid. loc. cit.

And that it wassuperior to the beer made in other countries maybereadily inferred, from the eulogium passed uponit by the historian, contrasted with the contemptin which this beverage was held by the Greeks.!Strabo and other ancient authors have likewisementioned it under the name of zythus; and thoughHerodotus pretends that it was merely used as asubstitute for wine in the lowlands, where corn wasprincipally cultivated §, its more reasonable to concludeit was drunk by the peasants II in all parts ofEgypt, though less in those districts where vineswere abundant.

The historian would, probably,have made a similar observation, if he had travelledin these days in England ; but it is generally allowedthat, though the English excel in the qualityof their beer, the annual consumption of wine isnot inconsiderable, and that there is no difficultyin procuring it from a far greater distance. InEgypt, native wines of a choice kind, whethermade in the vicinity or brought from another province,were confined to the rich ; and we learnfrom Strabo t that this was the case even at Alexandria,where wine could be obtained in greaterquantity than in any other part of Egypt, owingto the proximity of the Mareotic district t, and thecommon people were there content with beer andthe poor wine of the coast of Libya.BEER.The Egyptian beer was made from barley § ; but,as hops were unknown, they were obliged to haverecourse to other plants, in order to give it a grate-herodotus.ii. 77. f Strabo, lib. xvii.J " Mareotic wine, which they also call Alexandrian, from the lakenear that city."

The accountgiven by Athenaeum of Egyptian beer is thatit was very strong, and had so exhilarating aneffect that they danced, and sang, and committedthe same excesses, as those who were intoxicatedwith the strongest wines : an observation confirmedby the authority of Aristotle, whose opinion onthe subject has at least the merit of being amusing.For we must smile at the philosopher's method ofdistinguishing persons suffering under the influenceof wine and beer, however disposed he wouldhave been to accuse us of ignorance, in not havingyet discovered how invariably the former in thatstate " lie upon their face, and the latter on theirbacks." tThough beer was common to many countries,that of Egypt was of a peculiar kind, and, as Strabo §observes, different methods of preparing it wereadopted by different people.

BEER. 173beer is a very different beverage from that ofFrance, or from the hooza of modern Egypt. Inthis last, indeed, it is impossible to recognise anyresemblance, and no attempt is made to give it theflavour common to beer, or to obtain for it anyother recommendation than its intoxicating properties.The secret of preparing it from barley hasremained from old times, but indolence havingbanished the trouble of adding other ingredients,they are contented with the results of simple fermentation; and bread, and all similar substances,which are found to undergo that process, are nowemployed by the Egyptians, almost indifferently,for making booza.Besides beer, the Egyptians had what Pliny callsfactitious, or artificial, wine*, extracted from variousfruits, each sort, no doubt, known by some peculiarname, which pointed out its nature and quality.The Greeks and Latins comprehended every kindof beverage made by the process of fermentationunder the same general name, and beer was designatedas h2i.v\e.y-wine ; but, by the use of thename zythos, they show that the Egyptians distinguishedit by a totally different appellation. It isequally probable that those made from other fruitswere, in like manner, known by their respectivePlin. xiv. 16. " de vines factitious." If no wine was made fromgrapes (as Herodotus states) in the " corn country," these might havebeen there styled " home-made wines," a name applied to similarmixtures in other wingless districts. But it is not likely that theywere included by the Egyptians under the head of wines. Conf.Theophr. de causes Plant, vi. 10.

Palm wine,says Pliny, was common throughout the east, andone sort is noticed by Herodotus as having beenused by the Egyptians in the process of embalming* ; but it is uncertain whether this last wasmade in the manner described by Pliny t, whichrequired a modis or peck and a half, of the ripefruit to be macerated and squeezed into threecofigii, or about twenty-two pints, of water.The palm wine made at the present day is simplyfrom an incision in the heart of the tree, immediatelybelow the base of the upper branches, anda jar is attached to the part to catch the juice whichexudes from it. But a palm thus tapped is renderedperfectly useless as a fruit-bearing tree, andgenerally dies in consequence § ; and it is reasonableto suppose that so great a sacrifice is seldommade except when date trees are to be felled, orwhen they grow in great abundance, as in the OasesHerodot. ii. 86. f Plin.xiv. 16.% Called by Pliny the " medulla," or " cerebrum," and in Arabicbulb, " the heart," or jumna.

The modern name of thisbeverage in Egypt is lowbgeh : in flavour it resemblesa very new light wine, and may be drunkin great quantity when taken from the tree ; but,as soon as the fermentation has commenced, its intoxicatingqualities have a powerful and speedyeffect. It is not confined to Egypt and the Oases :the inhabitants of other parts of Africa* and manypalm-bearing countries are in the habit of makingit in the same manner ; nor do scruples of religionprevent the Moslems from indulging in its use. InNubia a wine is extracted from the dates themselves ;but this is now less common than the more potentbrandy which they distil from the same fruit, andwhich is a great favourite in the valley of the Nile.In former times, figs, pomegranates, myxas t, andother fruits were also used in Egypt for makingartificial wines, and herbs of different kinds wereapplied to the same purpose ; many of which, itmay be presumed, were selected for their medicinalproperties. $FRUIT TREES*Among the various fruit-trees cultivated by theancient Egyptians, palms, of course, held the firstThe blacks are particularly fond of intoxicating drinks.

The fruit constituted a principalpart of their food, both in the month of August,when it was gathered fresh from the trees, and atother seasons of the year, when it was used in apreserved state. They had two different modes ofkeeping the dates ; one was by the simple processof drying them, the other was by making theminto a conserve, like the agweh * of the presentday ; and of this, which was eaten either cooked oras a simple sweetmeat, I have found some cakes t,as well as the dried dates, in the sepulchres ofThebes. For though Pliny affirms that the datesof Egypt, Ethiopia, and Arabia were, from theheat and dryness of the soil t, incapable of beingpreserved, modern experience, and the knowledgewe have of the ancient customs of Egypt, provethe reverse of what is stated by that author. Yethe § speaks of dates of the Thebaid kept in vases,which he supposes to be necessary for their preservation; and it would appear that he alluded tothe agweh, did he not also suggest the necessity ofdrying them in an oven.The same author makes a just remark respectingthe localities where the palm prospers, and theAgA^'eh, or adjweh, is a mass of dates pressed and preservedin baskets, which is commonly sold in all the markets of modemEgypt.+ One of these is in the British Museum.J Plin.

Wherever it is found, it is asure indication of water : there are therefore nopalms in the desert, except at the Oases, and thosespots where springs lie near the surface ; and if itmay be said to flourish in a sandy soil, this is onlyin situations where its roots can obtain a certainquantity of moisture. The cultivated tree is rearedfrom offsets, those grown from the stone producingan inferior fruit ; and the offsets, which are taken atabout seven years' growth, bear dates in other fiveor six years, the tree living sixty or seventy, andeven upwards t, according to circumstances connectedwith the soil or the mode of its culture.Dates were also given to camels and otheranimals t, as is still the custom in the East ; andthis alone would suffice to prove their greatabundance §, and the utility of the palm as a valuableand productive fruit-tree. || But the numerous" Igitur levi, sabulosaque terra, majore in parte et nitrous.Gaudet et riguis, totoque anno libere cum met, anno sitienti."f Conf.

V.purposes to which its branches, and other parts,might be applied, tended still more to render itscultivation a matter of primary importance : for noportion of this tree is without its peculiar use. Thetrunk serves for beams, either entire or split inhalf; of the greet, or branches, are made wickerbaskets, bedsteads, coops, and ceilings of rooms,answering every purpose for which laths or anythin wood-work are required ; the leaves are convertedinto mats, brooms, and baskets ; of thefibrous tegument, at the base of the branches,strong ropes are made ; and even the bases of thegreet are beaten flat and formed into brooms. Norare the stalks of the bunches without their use ; andtheir fibres, separated by the mallet, serve for makingropes, and for the lees which is so serviceable inthe bath. Besides the brandy, the lowhgehy andthe date wine, a vinegar is also extracted from thefruit : and the large proportion of saccharine mattercontained in dates might, if required, be applied touseful purposes.In Upper Egypt, another tree, which has beencalled the Theban palm *, was also much cultivated;and its wood, more solid and compact than thedate tree, is found to answer as well for raftsand other purposes connected with water, as foreastern desert, which was composed of 125 fruit-stalks, each containingfrom 30 to 60 dates, so that, on an average of 4-5, the bunch bore 6625dates; and every tree had from 5 to 15 bunches, and one of them asmany as 22. The above-mentioned bunch was of unusual size, whichmade me count the dates, but the fruit was small and bad, as of all thewild trees, and, probably, some of the dates did not come to maturityIn the valley of the Nile, a sedan (IJ acre) is sometimes planted with400 trees.• The Lucifer Thebaica.

The general character of itsgrowth differs essentially from that of the date tree,having always bifurcated limbs*, and this peculiarityenables us to recognise it when representedin the sculptures. The fruit is a large roundednut, with a fibrous exterior envelope, which has asweet flavour, very similar to our gingerbread.The nut itself, when gathered unripe, is also eaten,and then presents a substance resembling cartilageor horn; but so soon as it is ripe it becomes exceedinglyhard, and is not unlike, though muchsmaller than, the cocoa-nut. It was employed bythe Egyptians for the hollow socket of their drills ;and being found peculiarly adapted for this purpose,from its great durability, it still continuesto be used by carpenters and cabinet-makers inEgypt. That the mode of applying it among theancients was precisely similar to that adopted atthe present day, we have ample testimony fromthe sculptures of Thebes, where it occurs apartfrom, and affixed to t, the instrument itself in thehands of the workmen. 1 But it was not exclusivelyused, and we find they frequently substitutedsome hard wood ; a specimen of which §may be seen in the highly interesting collection oftools found at Thebes by Mr. Burton, and nowin the British Museum ; this, with the drills, andAbout five feet, sometimes more, sometimes less, from the ground,it divides into two branches, each of which again separates into twoothers, and these again into two other pairs, always by twos, the uppermostsets being crowned by the leaves and fruit.f Vide wood-cut, No. 150.

It then becamedivided into different parts, distinguished by a peculiarname, according to the purpose for whichthey were intended ; and the vineyard, orchard,kitchen and flower garden, had each its ownfixed limits, whose dimensions depended on themeans or the caprice of its owner. Some of thericher individuals extended still farther the rangeof their villas ; and a park (jra^a^eKrog * ) was added,which, independent of its fish-ponds t and preservesfor game, contained many different sections,as the gallinarium for keeping hens, the cheno-Conf.

ThisDiod. i. 43.2J8 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. VI.did not, however, prevent their using many otherkinds of flowers in the composition of bouquets,garlands, and chaplets ; and artificial representationsof them were employed by the Egyptiansfor the same purpose, as we may infer from anexpression of Pliny * already noticed, and fromthe imitation of flowers and leaves in painted linendiscovered in the tombs of Thebes. The Greeksand Romans had the same custom, and their guestswere, in like manner, decked with flowers or garlands; which were brought in, according to Theseus,at the beginning of their entertainments, or,according to some, before the second course ; andin all cases they were provided by the master ofthe house. They not only adorned their heads t,necks, and breasts, like the Egyptians, but oftenbestrewed the couches on which they lay, and allparts of the room, with flowers ; though the headwas chiefly regarded, as appears from Horace ||,Anacreon, Ovid*, and other ancient authors.And this ceremony, like that of anointing the headwith sweet-scented ointment tt, was probably derivedby the Greeks from Egypt, or, as somesuppose, through the loans, from Asia. They alsoPlin. xxi. 2. Vide supra, p. 183.t Hor. Od. lib. ii. 7. vii. : —Coronets patentesMalobathro Syria camillus."And, Athen. xv. cc. 4. and 9.J Athen. xv. 5. § Ibid.II Hor.

That those whocould not afford the more costly kind should besatisfied with a cheaper quality, is highly probable,and many were doubtless contented with cups ofcommon earthenware : and though it may be saidthat the modern Egyptians have the custom ofdrinking water from earthen bottles, yet manyof the richer classes have brass t or, occasionally,porcelain and silver cups ; and if these are used bya far less civilised and opulent people, for so simplea beverage as water, how much more likely werethey to have been adopted by the ancient Egyptians,a people who were possessed of great riches,fond of luxury and show, and known to have employedvases of glass, porcelain, and the preciousmetals, for numerous purposes, both in their housesand in the temples of the gods.The practice of introducing wine at the commencement§ of an entertainment, or before dinnerhad been served up, was not peculiar to this people ;and the Chinese, to the present day, offer it atvictuals, but is universally adopted by every one."

Norwas it deemed unbecoming the gravity and dignityof a priest to admit musicians into his house, or totake pleasure in witnessing the dance ; and, seatedwith their wives and family in the midst of theirfriends, the highest functionaries of the sacerdotalorder enjoyed the lively scene. In the same manner,at a Greek entertainment, diversions of allkinds were introduced ; and Xenophon and Platoinform us that Socrates, the wisest of men, amusedhis friends with music, jugglers, mimics, buffoons,and whatever could be desired for exciting cheerfulnessand mirth.Though impossible for us now to form anynotion of the character or style of Egyptian music,we maybe allowed to conjecture that it was studiedon scientific principles ; and, from the great attentionpaid to it by Pythagoras, many years of whoselife were spent in learning " the wisdom of theEgyptians," there is every reason to believe thatwhatever defects existed in the skill of ordinaryperformers, who gained their livelihood by playingin public, or for the entertainment of a privateparty, music was looked upon as an importantscience, and diligently studied by the priests themselves.According to Diodorus it was not customaryto make music part of their education, beingdeemed useless and even injurious, as tending torender the minds of men effeminate ; but this remarkcan only apply to the custom of studying it224- THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. Viasan amusement, which might lead to luxuriousand dissolute habits : and Plato, who was well acquaintedwith the usages of the Egyptians, distinctlysays that they considered music of thegreatest consequence, from its beneficial effectsupon the mind of youth. This is confirmed bythe following assertion of Strabo, that the childrenof the Egyptians were taught letters, the songsappointed by law, and a certain kind of music,established by government, to the exclusion ofevery other ; and Diodorus himself not only allowsthe invention of music to have been ascribed bythe Egyptians to divine origin, but shows thatthe poets and musicians of Greece visited Egyptfor the purpose of improvement.*The authority of Plato, who had spent thirteenyears in the country, and had paid particular attentionto the institutions of the Egyptians, is of thegi-latest weight on this question ; and the wholepassage connected with it is of so much interest,that I cannot refrain from introducing the dialoguein which it occurs, tAthen. Guest. The plan we have been layingdown for the education of youth was known long-agoto the Egyptians, that nothing but beautifulforms and fine music should be permitted to enterinto the assemblies of young people. Havingsettled what those forms and what that musicshould be, they exhibited them in their temples jDiod. i. 9G.f Plato, 2(J book of Laws,CHAP. VI. MUSIC. 225nor was it allowable for painters, or other imitativeartists, to innovate or invent any forms differentfrom what were established ; nor lawful, either inpainting, statuary, or any branches of music, tomake any alteration : upon examination, therefore,you will find that the pictures and statues madeten thousand years ago are in no one particularbetter or worse than what they now make.Clin, What you say is wonderful.Athen. Yes, it is in the true spirit of legislationand policy : other things, practised among thatpeople, may, perhaps, be of a trifling nature ; butwhat they ordained about music is right, and itdeserves consideration, that they were able to makelaws about things of this kind, firmly establishingsuch melody as was fitted to rectify the perversenessof nature. This must have been the work ofthe Deity, or of some divine man ; as in fact theysay in Egypt, that the music which has been solong preserved was composed by Isis, and thepoetry likewise ; so that, as I said, if any one isable to apprehend the rectitude of them, he ought tohave the courage to reduce them to law and order.For the search of pleasure and pain, which is alwaysdirected to the use of new music, perhaps possessesno great power of corrupting the consecratedchoir by an accusation of its antiquity. It appears,therefore, that the choir of the Egyptians was byno means capable of being corrupted, but that thecontrary was entirely the case."That the Egyptians were particularly fond ofVOL. ir. Q226 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. VI.music, is abundantly proved by the paintings intheir* tombs of the easiest times ; and we evenfind they introduced figures performing on thefavourite instruments of the country, among thedevices with which they adorned fancy boxes ortrinkets ; and the representation of a woman playingthe guitar, which forms part of an ornamental designon a wooden box, in the Berlin museum, willserve to illustrate this fact, and to show how muchgrace is sometimes evinced in Egyptian designs.Of this I shall have occasion to speak hereafter.*That they paid great attention to the study ofmusic, and had arrived at a very accurate knowledgeof the art, is evident, when we consider thenature of the instruments they used, and the perfectacquaintance they must have had with theprinciples of harmony ; and not only do the sculpturesprove the fondness, and, I may add, the skillof the Egyptians, in the use of musical instruments,but the fact is confirmed by a statement of Athenaeumt, who expressly tells us that both the Greeksand barbarians were taught by refugees from Egypt,and that the Alexandrian were the most scientificand skilful players on pipes and other instruments.In the infancy of music, as Dr. Burney has justlyobserved, " no other instruments were known thanthose of percussion, and it was, therefore, littleIn Vol. III., beginning of Chap. VII.f Athen. iv. 25. He quotes Menaces of Barca and Andros (in hisannals of Alexandria) ; and these migrations appear to have been mostnumerous at the period when the 7th Ptolemy, called Cacergetes, persecutedmen of art and science.CHAP. VI. THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF MUSIC. 227more than metrical." Pipes of various kinds, andthe flute, were afterwards invented ; at first veryrude, and made of reeds, which grew in the riversand lakes. The flute*, says Horace t, was originallysmall and simple, with a few holes, and if it wasintroduced at the chorus of a play, its sound hadonly sufficient power to suit a theatre of a verylimited size. But in process of time it was madelarger, with more notes and a louder tone, and,bound with brass, it rivalled the tone of the trumpet.To discover, we can scarcely say to invent,such simple instruments, required a very slighteffort, which observation afterwards improved ;and music must have undergone a regular progression,through the early stages of infancy and youth,till it attained the age of maturity. But, ere itreached this stage of perfection, the powers of thehuman mind had been called forth to exalt its character; improvement followed improvement, andmusic became a noble and valuable science. Tothe alterations made in the simple instruments ofearly times, succeeded the invention of othersof a far more complicated kind ; and the many-tibiawas the flute ; but it also signified a pipe, and the name tibiadextra et ministry was applied to the double pipe. Tibia obliqua,TrXayiavXog, was properly the flute.f "tibia non ut nunc orichalco vincta, tubjeque^mula, sed tenuis simplexque, foramina pauloAspirate et adesse chorus erat utilise, atqueNondum spissa nimis implore sedilia flatu :PostquamAccessit numerisque mosque licentia majorSic prince motumque et luxuries addict art."Hor. de Art.

VI.Stringed harp, lyre, and other instruments, addedto the power and variety of musical sounds.To contrive a method of obtaining perfect melodyfrom a smaller number of strings, by shorteningthem on a neck during the performance, likeour modern violin, was, unquestionably, a moredifficult task than could be accomplished in theinfancy of music, and great advances must havebeen already made in the science before this couldbe attained, or before the idea would suggest itselfto the mind. With this principle, however, theEgyptians were well acquainted, and the sculpturesunquestionably prove it, in the frequent use of thethree-stringed guitar.A harp or lyre, having a number of strings,imitating various sounds, and disposed in the orderof notes, might be invented even in an early stageof the art ; but a people who had not attentivelystudied the nature of musical sounds would necessarilyremain ignorant of the method of procuringthe same tones from a limited number of strings ;nor are our means simplified till they become perfectlyunderstood. It is, then, evident, not onlyfrom the great fondness for music evinced by theearly Egyptians, but from the nature of the veryinstruments they used, that the art was studiedwith great attention, and that they extended thesame minute and serious investigation to this asto other sciences. And though Diodorus * thinksDiod. i. 1.CHAP. VI. ANTIQUITY OF MUSIC 2^9that the Egyptians did not consider music a necessarypart of an accomplished education, yet heattributes * the invention of it to the same deitywho gave them laws and letters, who regulated theaffairs of religion, and who taught them astronomy,and all useful and ornamental arts.This fabulous account of its origin evidentlyshows music to have been sanctioned, and evencultivated, by the priests themselves, who invariablypretended to have derived from the gods theknowledge of the sciences they encouraged, ofwhich their body was the sole repository andsource. Hermes or Mercury was, therefore, reputedto be the first discoverer of the harmony andprinciple of voices or sounds, and the inventor ofthe lyresFrom his limiting the number of its chords tothree, the historian evidently confounds the lyrewith the Egyptian guitar ; yet this traditionalstory, which he learnt during his visit to the country,serves to attest the remote antiquity of stringedinstruments, and proves the great respect paid tomusic by the Egyptian priests, who thought it notunworthy of a deity to be its patron and inventor.In Greece, too, where music was particularly encouraged,its invention was attributed to the gods.Wind instruments were said to owe their origin toDid. i. 16.•)- The same fable passed into Greece ; but Apollo was said to havebeen the first who accompanied the lyre with his voice, and this wassupposed to have given him a decided superiority over the flute ofMarshal.Q 3230 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS.

Those who played at the houses of the rich,as well as the ambulant musicians of the streets,were of the lower classes, and made this employmentthe means of obtaining their livelihood ; andin many instances both the minstrels and the choristerswere blind.*From what has been said, it appears, first, thatmusic was studied by the Egyptian priests withother views than that of affording pleasure and entertainment,the same science being borrowedby Pythagoras from Egypt. Secondly, that it wasuniversally used at their private parties, where professionalpeople were hired to perform. Thirdly,that we are to understand from the remark of Diodorus,of its not being customary for the Egyptiansto learn music, that the higher orders did not studyit as an amusement ; anti though the twelfthPtolemy obtained the surname of Alleges from hisskill in playing the flute, we cannot infer a generalcustom from the caprice of a Greek.

And, some timebefore, Themistocles, upon refusing the harp at anentertainment, passed for an uninstructed and ill-bredperson. Hence Greece became celebratedfor skilful musicians ; and as all persons therelearned music, those who attained to no proficiencyin it were thought uneducated and unaccomplished."Cornelius Nepos, again, mentioningEpaminondas, observes that *' he played the harpand flute, and perfectly understood the art ofdancing, with other liberal sciences;" 'though,"he adds, *' in the opinion of the Romans, theseare trivial things, and not worthy of notice, yet inStrabo was born at Aspasia, in Pontius, on the borders of Cappadocia,and bad studied in Greece, but was educated as a Roman.■f Polybius, lib. iv. 20, 21., commends the Arcadian for their love ofmusic and the dance.

THEIR IDEAS Respecting MUSIC. 243Greece they were reckoned highly commendable''Nor was it regarded with any other feeling bythe Israelites ; and they not only considered itbecoming to delight in music and the dance, butpersons of rank deemed them a necessary partof their education. Like the Egyptians, withwhom they had so long resided, and many ofwhose customs they adopted, the Jews carefullydistinguished sacred from profane music. Theyintroduced it at public and private rejoicing,at funerals, and in religious services : but thecharacter of the airs, like the words of their songs,varied according to the occasion ; and they hadcanticles of mirth, of praise, of thanksgiving, andof lamentation. Some were epithalamia, or songscomposed to celebrate marriages ; others to commemoratea victory, or the accession of a prince ;to return thanks to the Deity, or to celebrate hispraises ; to lament a general calamity, or a privateaffliction ; and others, again, where peculiar totheir festive meetings. On these occasions theyintroduced the harp, lute, tabret*, and various instruments,together with songs and dancing, andthe guests were entertained nearly in the samemanner as at an Egyptian feast. In the temple,and in the religious ceremonies, the Jews hadfemale as well as male performers, who were gene-conf.Luke, xv. 25.

David was not only remarkablefor his taste and skill in music, but took a delightin introducing it on every occasion. " And seeingthat the Levitess were numerous, and no longeremployed as formerly in carrying the boards, veils,and vessels of the tabernacle, its abode being fixedat Jerusalem, he appointed a great part of them tosing and play on instruments, at the religious festivals."Solomon, again, at the dedication of thetemple, employed " 120 priests, to sound withtrumpets t ; " and Josephus pretends that no lessthan 200,000 musicians were present at that ceremony,besides the same number of singers, whowere Levitess. tIt has always been doubted whether the Jewsstudied music with the same systematic views asthe Egyptians and Greeks; and as all airs, previousto the invention of notation, must have been traditional,and in some degree dependent on the tasteand memory of the performers, many have questionedthe possibility of their being either numerousor faithfully preserved.Vide supra.

It is impossible for us todetermine whether the Egyptian priests, in latertimes, devised any method of preserving their melodies,or trusted entirely to oral tradition, as thissecret would have been concealed by them with thesame jealous care as the mysteries themselves ; judging,however, from that adopted in Greece *, whichwas by disposing the letters of the alphabet in differentways, we may conclude that if the Egyptiansreally had any, it was equally cumbrous and imperfectRespecting the origin of this invention amongthe Greeks there is a diversity of opinion ; it isgenerally attributed to Terpander, a celebratedpoet and musician t, who flourished about 67O yearsbefore our era ; but the complication of sixteenhundred and twenty different notes must at alltimes have presented a considerable difficulty inreading and recollecting them.To inquire into the notions of Pythagoras,Plato t, and other Greek sages, who spent muchIn one of the paintings from Herculaneum, a woman is seen playingon a lyre of eleven strings, and another sings from a paper whichshe holds in her hand, and which has either the notes, or the words ofthe song, written upon it.f Plutarch, de Musica.j Plato and Eudoxus were thirteen years in Egypt, according toStrabo (hb. xvii).

The latter consideredone of the noblest purposes to which itcould be applied was to soothe and calm the mind,and deemed it the duty of a philosopher to lookupon it as an intellectual study, rather than anamusement ; for the gravity of Pythagoras censuredthe custom of judging music by the senses,and required that it should be submitted to theacumen of the mind, and examined by the rulesof harmonic proportion.! It was the idea of thisphilosopher " that air was the vehicle of sound,and that the agitation of that element, occasionedby a similar action in the parts of the soundingbody, was its cause. The vibrations of a string, orother sonorous body, being communicated to theair, affected the auditory nerves with the sensationof sound ; and this sound," he argued, " was acuteor grave in proportion as the vibrations were quickor slow." Others were of a different opinion ;and "Aristoxenus held the ear to be the sole standardof musical proportions.

Did he arrive at theseconclusions from his own experience ? Or is itnot more probable that he was indebted to thoseunder whom he studied for this insight into asubject they had so long been examining? Butthe fact of Pythagoras being the sole teacher ofthis doctrine, goes far to prove that it did notoriginate in Greece, and that his opinions werefounded on Egyptian data. For what that philosopherasserted respecting sound, emitted bya long and short string of the same quality andthickness, " that the shorter made the quicker vibrationsand uttered the acuter sound," had beenalready shown by the Egyptians ; and we may fairlyconclude that he derived his knowledge of thisVide Encyclop.

The remarkof the father of history, that some of their songsbore a plaintive character, is probably just ; yetwe cannot imagine it applicable to the generalityof those introduced at the festive meetingsof a cheerful people.

" I have been struck," says the historian,with many things during my inquiries in Egypt,but with none more than this song, and I cannotconceive from whence it was borrowed ; indeed,they seem to have had it from time immemorial,and to have knowai it by the name Manerost : forthey assured me it was so called from the son oftheir first monarch, who, being carried off by a prematuredeath, was honoured by the Egyptians witha funeral diro;e. And this was the first and onlysong they used at that early period of their history."Though this account is highly improbable, yetwe learn from it that one of the many songs of theEgyptians was similar to the Linus of Greece,which was of a plaintive character, peculiarlyadapted to mournful occasions ; but whether it wasof Egyptian or of Phoenician origin, it is of littlemoment to inquire. Plutarch, on the other hand,asserts, that it was suited to festivities and the pleasuresof the table §, and that, "amidst the diversionsof a sociable party, the Egyptians made theroom resound with the song of Maneros." InHerodot. ii. 79.pausanias (Graeca. lib. ix.) says, " The Eg \-ptians call the song ofLinus in their language ]NIauer6s ; " and mentions two persons namedLinus. Vide also Hor.

SONG OF Manners. 251order, therefore, to reconcile these conflicting statements,we are naturally led to the conclusion, thatthe Egyptians had two songs, bearing a name resemblingManeros, which have been confoundedtogether by Greek writers ; and that one of thesebore a lugubrious, the other a lively, character.Many conjectures have been offered respectingthe nature and origin of the song of Maneros, andsome doubt its having derived this name from ason of the first Egyptian monarch *, contendingthat it was so called from the person to whommusic owed its invention t ; both which opinionsare noticed by Plutarch ; who in another workstates, on the authority of Heraclitus, that Linus §was a native of Euboea. And from his adding,that Linus was famed for making lugubrious poems,it is evident that the song mentioned under thisname by Herodotus, and considered to be theManeros of Egypt, had a similar origin with thefabulous Linus himself.If, however, conjecture is permitted, we maypresume the song of Maneros did not derive itsHerodotus, loc. cH.

Pollux calls him the inventor of agriculture,and says the song Maneros was sung by husbandmen.

Pausanias says Linus, the inventor of songs, wasa son of Apollo (de Grsec. hb. ii.)j but refers to another part of hiswork (lib. ix), where he mentions one Linus, the son of Aniphimarus(the son of Neptune) and Urania, killed by Apollo ; the other a son ofIsnienius, killed by Hercules. Some suppose there were three of thisname ; but authors are not agiced upon the subject. Pausanias assertspositively, that neither of the two just mentioned composed anypoems ; or, at least, any that came down to posterity." lib. ix.252 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. VI.name from any individual; * and if this and theGreek Linus resembled each other, it was probablymerely in their general character. The formeridea is partly confirmed by another observation ofPlutarch t, " that others say Maneros is not a name,but a complimentary manner of greeting madeuse of by the Egyptians to one another, at theirsolemn feasts and banquets, implying a wish ' thatwhat they were then engaged in might prove fortunateand successful j' for such is the true importof the word." It is, indeed, reasonable to suppose,that their songs were made to suit the occasions,either of rejoicing and festivity, of solemnity, or oflamentation ; and all their agricultural and otheroccupations had, undoubtedly, as at the presentday, their appropriate songs.At the religious ceremonies and processions,where music was introduced, there is reason tobelieve the attendance of ordinary performerswas not permitted, but that musicians attached tothe priestly order, and organised for this specialpurpose, were alone employed ; who were consideredto belong exclusively to the service of thetemple, as each military band of their army to itsrespective corps.When an individual died, it was usual for thewomen to issue forth from the house, and throwingdust and mud upon their heads t, to utter cries oflamentation as they wandered through the streetsI think that this] expression occurs in a hieroglyphic legend :Mere, the maker of hymns :" perhaps applied to Re, the SuntPlut. de Is. 17.J Herodot. ii. 85.

The cymbals were of mixed metal, apparentlybrass, or a compound of brass and silver, and ofa form exactly resembling those of modern times,though smaller, being only seven, or five inches anda half, in diameter.

Drums and someother noisy instruments, which are used at marriagesand on other occasions, accompany the cymbals,but these last are more peculiarly appropriatedto the service of the sheikhs, and the external ceremoniesof religion : and this is the more remarkable,as we find no instances in the paintings ofThebes of their having been used at the festivemeetings of the ancient Egyptians ; and a female,whose coffin contained a pair of cymbals, wasdescribed in the hieroglyphics of the exterior asthe minstrel of a deity. We may, therefore,conclude, that this instrument belonged, as withthe modern Egyptians, to the service of religion,though probably not so exclusively* as the sacredsistrum.• 1 am not certain that the two figures represented in the wood-cutNo. 201. are not playing cymbals, though from the injury done tothose sculptures we are unable to discover what they hold in theirhands.

It is not improbable, that theirhollow head contained a loose metallic ball, whichgave a jingling noise when shaken : and we findthat the clang of such instruments was thought asVOL. ir. s258 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS.

Amoebseus,again, an Athenian harper of great repute, receivedan Attic talent, or 193/. 15s. a day for his performance: and the actors of the Roman stage werenot only paid immense sums, Roscius making 500sententia, or 4036/. 9>^. Qd. per annum ; but in latertimes they became such favourites, that they establishedparties in the city, and had sufficient influenceto induce the people to espouse theirquarrels.Similar instruments of wood are used in the same manner by theJapanese.CHAP. vr. :\nLiTARY MUSIC. 259Though the Egyptians were fond of buffooneryand gesticulation, they do not seem to have hadany public show which can be said to resemble atheatre ; nor were their pantomimic exhibitions,which consisted chiefly in dancing and gesture *,accompanied with any scenic representation. Thestage is, indeed, allowed to have been purely aGreek invention ; and to dramatic entertainments,which were originally of two kinds, comedy andtragedy, were added the Roman pantomime. Musicformed a principal part of the old comedy ; anda chorus was present, as in tragedy, to sing betweenthe acts.t And indeed when we consider the licenseof ancient comedy, and the frequent decrees whichit was found necessary to make, in order to suppressit, and sometimes even to prohibit dramaticperformances, or the erection of a theatre, we maybeassured that similar representations would nothave been tolerated by the severity of an Egyptianpriesthood, whether the idea had originated in thecountry, or had been accidentally introduced at alater period from the Greeks. 1^MILITARY MUSIC.Some instruments of the military band differedfrom those of ordinary musicians ; but it may beAt Rome, after the time of Augustus, the mimi, or pantomime,were confined to these, and did not speak.-f- Our orchestra performs this office of the chorus. — The duties ofthe Greek chorus varied at different times.f There was a theatre at Antique, a city of central Egypt, foundedby Adrian, and at Alexandria ; but these were Greek or Roman towns,and no building of the kind is met with in any of ancient Egyptiandates2THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS.CHAP.

The musicians were not disco.199-A military bandextinguished by any particular dress from the rest ofthe soldiers : whole regiments are represented the battle scenes at Medeenet Haboo, in Thebes.CHAP.

VI.of the troops, at least, with a sword and shield, orother requisite means of defence.The trumpet was particularly, though not exclusively,appropriated to martial purposes. It wasstraight, like the Roman tuba, or our common trumpet; but it is uncertain whether that used in theEgyptian cavalry was of another form, as in theRoman army ; where the litmus, or clarion, bent alittle at the end like an augur's staff, supplied theplace of the tuba of the infantry.In Greece, various instruments were adopted forsummoning troops to battle. The Lacedaemonianand Cretan advanced to the sound of flutes(^auT^Qi — pipes*, others to that of lutes; and manypreferred the lyre, which, according to Plutarch t,was long employed by the Cretan for this purpose.The trumpet, indeed, does not appear to have beenin very early use among the Greeks, and it is rarelymentioned by Homer at the siege of Troy, wherethe chief instruments were the flute, lyre, and pipe,or (Tupiy^. The trumpet or trakTriy^ was, however,known in Greece before that event : it wasreputed to have been the invention of Minerva, orof Tyrrhenust, a son of Hercules; and in latertimes it was generally adopted §, both as a martialinstrument, and by the ambulant musicians of thestreets.

USE OF THE TRUMPET. ^63against the trumpet, and the people of Osiris andLycopoHs abstained entirely from its use, conceiving,says Plutarch *, from the sound of this instrumentresembling the braying of an ass, that it wasTyphonian ; or, at least, that it reminded them tooforcibly of an animal emblematic of the evil genius.The Israelites had trumpets for warlike t as wellas sacred purposes t, for festivals and rejoicing § ;and the office of sounding them was not only honourable,but was committed solely to the priests. Il Theywere of different kinds. Some of silver ^, whichwere suited to all occasions, as I have alreadystated ; others appear to have been of horns, likethe original cornish of the Romans ; and these aredistinctly stated to have been employed at thesiege of Jericho. ** The Greeks had six species oftrumpets; the Romans four, in their army — thetuba, corners, lucina, and litmus ; and in ancienttimes the concha, so called from having beenoriginally made of a shell. They were the onlyinstruments employed by them for military purposes,and in this they differed from the Greeks andEgyptians.The sculptures of Thebes fail to inform us if thelong and short drum were both comprehended inPlut. de Side. et Sir. s. 30.\ Numb.

Among many ancient people itwas customary to teach slaves to dance and sing,in order that they might divert their master, orentertain a party of guests ; and the Romans evenemployed them in various trades and manufactures.Those, too, who gave proofs of ability and genius,were frequently instructed in literature and theliberal arts, and the masters profited by their industry,or sold them at a great price in consequenceof their accomplishments. The Egyptians, indeed,pursued this system to a certain extent ; slaveswere employed in public works t, and in domesticoccupations t ; and there is evidence from thesculptures that many of the musicians and dancers,both men and women, were slaves, who had beentaken captive in war from their Ethiopian andAsiatic enemies. Yet it is not probable they wereinstructed in the same manner as those above mentionedat Rome ; though the very kind treatmentVide wood-cut, No. 201.t Exod. i. 11. 14.

Like the trumpet, itNo. 203. Mode of slinging the drum behind them, when on a march.was chiefly employed in the army ; and the evidenceof the sculptures is confirmed by the authorityof Clement of Alexandria, who states thatthe drum was used by the Egyptians in going towar.* Both these instruments are found to havebeen common at the earliest period, of which wehave any account from the sculptures of Thebes, orabout the sixteenth century before our era ; andthere is no reason to suppose them to have beenthen a recent invention.When a body of troops marched to the beat ofClemens Alex. fStroniat. ii. 164.268 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. VJ.drum, the drummer was often stationed in thecentre, or the rear, and sometimes immediatelybehind the standard bearers ; the trumpeter's postbeing generally at the head of the regiment,except when summoning them to form or advanceto the charge*; but the drummers were not alwaysalone, or confined to the rear and centre ; and whenforming part of the band, they marched in thevan, or, with the other musicians, were drawn uponone side while the troops defiled, as in our Europeanarmies.Besides the long drum, the Egyptians had another,not very unlike our own, both in form andsize, which was much broader in proportion to itslength than the tomtom just mentioned, being twofeet and a half high, and two feet broad. It wasbeaten with two wooden sticks ; but as there is norepresentation of the mode of using it, we are unableto decide whether it was suspended horizontallyand struck at both ends, as is usual with a drum ofthe same kind still used at Cairo, or at one endonly, like our own ; though, from the curve of thesticks, I am inclined to think it was slung andbeaten as the tambour of modern Egypt. Sometimesthe sticks were straight, and consisted of twoparts, the handle and a thin round rod, at whoseend a small knob projected, for the purpose offastening the leather pad with which the drum wasstruck : they were about a foot in length, and,judging from the form of the handle of one in the(.'onf. Joshua, vi. 9. " And the armed men went before the prieststhat blew the trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark."CHAP. Vr. MODE OF BRACING THE DRUM. '269Berlin Museum*, we may conclude they belonged,like those above mentioned, to a drum beaten atboth ends. Each extremity of the drum was coveredwith red leather, braced with catgut strings passingthrough small holes in its broad margin, and extendingin direct lines over the copper body, which,from its convexity, was similar in shape to a cask, tIn order to tighten the strings, and thereby tobrace the drum, a piece of catgut extended roundeach end, near the edge of the leather ; and crossingthe strings at right angles, and being twistedround each separately, braced them all in proportionas it was drawn tight : but this was onlydone when the leather and the strings had becomerelaxed by constant use ; and as this piece of catgutwas applied to either end, they had the means ofdoubling the power of tension on every string. Itis true that this kind of drum does not occur in anysculptures hitherto discovered ; yet it is not lesscertain that it was among the instruments of thecountry, one of them having been found in the excavationsmade at Thebes, by S. Anni D'Athanasi,during Mr. Madox's stay at that place in 1823; towhom I am indebted for the original sketch of theaccompanying wood-cut. tTHE Half.Besides the ordinary forms of Egyptian instruments,several were constructed according to aGiven in wood-cut, No. 3-t a. p.

They are more rude in shape than thoseusually represented ; and though it is impossibleto ascertain the precise number of their chords t,they do not appear to have exceeded seven or eight.Conf. the royal minstrels of David and Solomon.

Viandare fastened in a different manner from ordinaryEgyptian harps.I have ah-lady noticed the great antiquity of theharp, and its early use in some Eastern or Asiaticcountries*, which is fully confirmed by the oldestEgyptian sculptures. It does not appear to havebeen known to the Greeks, but many stringedinstruments, as the cithara (x<9apa) went from Asiato Greece : and this last, according to Plutarch,was originally styled Asiatic t, having been introducedfrom Lesbos t, where music was long cultivatedwith success. The same author observesthat the cithara was employed upon sacred andfestive* occasions §, and Heraclitus of Lesbos supposedit to have been invented by Amphion II ; butadiversity of opinion always existed upon the subjectof its introduction into Greece.Terpander^, who lived about two hundredyears after Homer, was one of the first to attainany celebrity in its use, and he is reputed to haveinstituted laws for this instrument some time beforethey were arranged for the flute or pipe. Cepion,his disciple, who followed the Lesbian model, esta-egyptwas included in Asia by some ancient writers. Vide alsoHerodot. ii. 15, 16.f Plut. de Musica.:j: The Lesbians were famed for the lyre and other instruments.Conf, Horace, Od. lib. i. 21. 1 1. : —Hung filius nevis,Hung Lesbia scrape electro."And Od. i. 1. 34. : —Lesbos . . . tender barton."§ Plut.

STRINGS OF THE HARP. 273blushed its form ; and few changes were introducedinto it till Timotheus of Miletus*, who flourishedabout the year 400 b. c, added four to the previousseven chords.How far, then, do we find the Egyptians surpassedthe Greeks, at this early period, in thescience of music ! Indeed, long before the lyrewas known in Greece, the Egyptians had attainedthe highest degree of perfection in the form oftheir stringed instruments ; on which no improvementwas found necessary, even at a time whentheir skill was so great that Greek sages visitedEgypt to study music, among the other sciences, forwhich it was renowned. And harps of fourteen,and lyres of seventeen strings, are found to havebeen used by the ordinary Egyptian musicians, atthe remote period of the reign of Amosis, the firstking of the 18th dynasty, who lived about 1,570B. cst, nine hundred years before the time of Ter-pander.The strings of the Egyptian harp were of catgut ;and some of those discovered at Thebes, in 1823,were so well preserved, that they emitted a soundon being touched, as I shall presently have occasionto observe. Some harps stood upon the ground,having an even broad base ; others were placedupon a stool t, or raised upon a stand or limbattached to the lower part ; and from the .Grace, lib. iii.f Some harps of the time of Osirtasen I., b.c. 1700, have sevenchords.J Instances of this are also found at Herculaneum.

Many of the harps were coveredwith bulls' hides!, or with leather, which was sometimesof a green § or of a red|l colour, frequentlypainted with various devices, vestiges of which maybetraced in that of the Paris collectionsIt may be questioned whether the four-stringedinstrument above mentioned ought to bear thename of* harp; for certainly the difference in itsform from that used as an accompaniment to thelarge harp ** suffices to show that these two are notthe same, and this is further confirmed by the appearanceof two of the very same portable instrumentsin the Paris and British Museums.tt It mayalso be observed, that though the small harp hasonly four strings, it has six pegs, which would insidewood-cut, No. 209.-j- Vide wood-cut, No. 186.i As that of" wood-cut, No.'lSG.§ One found at Thebes by Mr. Salt.II One seen by ]Mr. Madox at Thebes.h Vide wood-cut, No. 213.** In wood-cut, No. 186.j-f Vide wood-cut.

It was always played withthe hands, and never, like the guitar and somelyres, with a plectrum. Another of very similarform, and with the same number of chords, wasfound at Thebes ; and from the copy I have seenof it, made by Mr. Madox, it appears to have beenfurnished with a peg at the lower end, whose useit is not easy to determine, but which probablyserved to secure the strings.It does not appear that the Egyptians had anymode of shortening the strings during the performance,either in this instrument or the harp, or hadinvented any substitute for our modern pedals ; noris there any instance of a double set of chords, asin the old Welsh harp. They could, therefore,only play in one key, until they tuned it afresh,which was done by turning the pegs.There is, however, reason to believe that thewant of pedals was partially supplied by the introhave seen a harp with six strings and nine pegs, probably anoversight of the draughtsman ; unless those additional pegs were usedfor some purpose. One of the lyres of Herculaneum has eleven stringsand seven pegs.T 3278 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. VI.diction of a second row of pegs, since we find thatthese are frequently double, or two to each string* ;and a contrivance of this kind might have the effectof giving an additional half note.In playing the harp, some minstrels sat cross-leggedon the ground, like Asiatics of the presentday, or upon one knee t, whether men or women t ;others preferred a low stool; and many stood,even while performing on ordinary occasions in thehouses of private individuals.Before the images of the gods, and in religiousceremonies, it is natural to suppose that thesacred minstrels adopted this posture, out of respectto the deity in whose service they wereengaged ; and we have abundant evidence from theharpers in Bruce's tomb, who are officiating beforeAo§, and from several other instances, that thisinstrument was employed in their form of worship,and to celebrate the praises of the gods. Sosuitable, indeed, was the harp considered for thispurpose, that they represented it in the hands ofthe deities themselves as well as the tambourineand the sacred sistrum. It was held in the sameconsideration by the Jews ; and there is reason tobelieve that in this respect they followed theexample of the Egyptians, from whom many oftheir customs were derived.

It is highlyinteresting, as well from its preservation as fromthe insight it gives us into the form and principle ofthese instruments ; and if it is far from being thefirst quality of harp, either in elegance of shape orinthe richness of its materials, yet, from the numberof its strings, it must have been one of the high-theharp of the Paris collection.Fig. 2. shows how the chords were fastened.Wood-cut, No. 21.3.CHAP.

It is to the excessive dryness ofthe soil, and of the rock in which the pits arehewn, frequently to the depth of fifteen, thirty,and even seventy feet, and to the total exclusionof air, that this is to be attributed j and grainsof corn and other seeds have been found, whichhave remained entire, without undergoing anyVide Jig. 3.111 wood-cut, ^o. eld.284 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS.

The frame was of wood,covered with red leather, on which could be traceda few hieroglyphics. The strings were fastenedto the upper limb, and wound round a rod insertedinto the lower part, which was probably turned inorder to tighten them, and may be considered similarin principle to that on the summit of manyancient lyres, or of the kisirka used in modernSeveral are now in the different collections of Europe. The experimentsare said to have been made in France.CHAP. VI. INSTRUMENT OF TWENTY STRINGS. Q85Ethiopia. In the former, the rod itself was turned ;in the latter, each string is fastened over a ring ofsome adhesive material, intervening between it andthe rod, and the turn of this ring regulates thetension of the chord. Neither this nor the twoabove alluded to were provided with pegs, a peculiaritywhich may be considered a distinctive markbetween this class of instruments and the harp.There are still two others, which appear unconnectedeither with the harp or lyre, and yet differfrom the two already described, having pegs tobrace the strings. Of these, one has a flat broadbody, covered with a sounding board, in the centreof which is a rod securing the chords ; and perpendicularto it is another rod at the upper end ofthe instrument, into which the pegs are insertedthat supported and tightened its ten strings.*The other, which bears still less analogy to theEgyptian harp, appears to have had five strings,each secured by a peg, and passing over a hollowcircular body, covered probably with a thin pieceof wood or leather. It was seven inches in length,the neck about one foot three inches, and thefive pegs were fixed in the lower side, in a directline, one behind the other. At the opposite endof the circular part were two holes, for fasteningthe rod that secured the strings, as in the precedinginstrument ; which may be seen in one ofthe two found at Thebes, some years since, byMr. Salt, and now in the British Museum.

They are bothof sycamore wood, and exactly like that in theBerlin collection, which has the five pegs entire,and has the body composed of three pieces of wood.At first sight this instrument appears to resemblethe Egyptian guitar, both in its form and theposition of the strings ; on restoring it, however,and introducing them, we find that the principlewas totally different, and that the neck was notNo. 214.Figs. 1, 3.

Diodorus Emitsthe number of its chords to three ; however, as hisdescription does not apply to the Egyptian lyre,but to the guitar, it is unnecessary to introduce ittill I mention that instrument.A singular story of its supposed invention * isrelated by Apollodorus. "The Nile," says theAthenian mythologist, "after having overflowedthe whole country of Egypt, when it returnedwithin its natural bounds, left on the shore a greatnumber of animals of various kinds, and among therest a tortoise t, the flesh of which being dried andwasted by the sun, nothing remained within theshell but nerves and cartilages, and these beingbraced and contracted by the drying heat becamesonorous. Mercury, walking along the banks ofthe river, happened to strike his foot against thisshell, and was so pleased with the sound produced,that the idea of a lyre presented itself to his imagination.He therefore constructed the instrumentin the form of a tortoise t, and strung it with thedried sinews of dead animals**The invention of the Greek lyre is also attributed to Mercury. Pausaniasstates that Mercury having found a tortoiseshell on a mountainof Arcadia, called Chelydorea, near Mount College, formed it into alyre. Pans. Graeca. lib. viii. Arcade. And he mentions a statue of Mercury,in the temple of Apollo at Argos, " holding a tortoiseshell, ofwhich he proposes to make a lyre." lib. ii.Curvseque lyre parents." — Hor. Od. lib. i. 10. 6.t Pausanias says the tortoise of Mount Parthenon, in Arcadia,was particularly suited for making lyres, as well as that of the Soonoak forest, which, for this purpose, rivalled the Indian species.

The Berlin and Leyden Museumspossess lyres of this kind, which, with the exceptionof the strings, are perfectly preserved. That in theformer collection is ornamented with horses' heads,and in form, principle, and the alternating lengthof its chords, resembles the one given in the precedingwood-cut ; though the board to which thestrings are fastened is nearer the bottom of the instrument,and the number of strings is thirteeninstead of ten ; and thus wee have an opportunity ofcomparing real Egyptian lyres with the representationsof them drawn by Theban artists, in thereign of Amunoph I., and other early monarchs,more than 3000 years ago.The body of the Berlin lyre is about ten incheshigh, and fourteen and a half broad, and the totalheight of the instrument is two feet.t Tliat ofLeyden t is smaller, and less ornamented, but it isAs in the preceding wood-cut.

Both these lyres were entirely of wood,and one of the sides, as of many represented in thesculptures *, was longer than the opposite one ; sothat they tuned the instrument by sliding thechords upwards, along the bar.Similar to these were many of the Greek lyres,sometimes imitating the shape and position of thehorns of a gazelle, and other elegant forms, and thenumber of their strings was as varied as those ofthe Egyptians. In Greece, the instrument hadat first only four chords, till an additional threewere introduced by Amphion ; who, as PausaniasVide wood-cuts, Nos. 217. and 218.f Pausan. lib. ix.u 3THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS.

The lyres in the paintingsof Herculaneum vary in the number of theirstrings, as much as those in the Egyptian frescos ;and we there find them with three, four, five, six,seven, eight, nine, ten, and eleven chords.There is no instance of a harp in those paintings ;but a triangular instrument t of eight strings, carriedunder the arm and played with both hands,bears some analogy to that previously describedfrom Thebes, which, as I have observed t, we doubtwhether to class among the harps or lyres : andanother of seven chords is played with the twohands in the manner of a harp), by a woman recliningon the ground. It is difficult to say whetherany one of these comes under the denominationo^ magadis, which, according to Athenaeum, " wasfurnished with strings §, like the cithara, lyra, andbarbiton •, " but though little can be ascertainedrespecting the form of the numerous instrumentsalluded to by ancient authors ||, the triangular lyreConf.

That this event took place aboutthe period when the inmate of the tomb lived, ishighly probable ; at least, if I am correct in consideringOsirtasen I. to be the Pharaoh the patronof Joseph ; and it remains for us to decide whetherthe disagreement in the number of persons here introduced,thirty-seven being written over them inhieroglyphics, is a sufficient objection i to theiridentity.It will not be foreign to the present subject tointroduce those figures, which are curious, if onlyconsidered as illustrative of ancient customs at thatearly epoch, and which will be looked upon withAthen. loc. cit.\ Suits gives this account of the aan^vKi), " opyai'ov fiovaiKovTf3iyu)voi'."

The lyre is rude, and differs alittle in form from those generally used in Egypt;but its presence here, and in others of the oldestsculptures, amply testifies its great antiquity, andclaims for it a rank among the earliest stringed instruments.THE GUITAR.The Egyptian guitar has only three chords ; andto it I believe Diodorus alludes, when he appliesPlate 14f Similar high shoes, or boots, were also worn by Greek andEtruscan, and even by Egyptian women, being found in the tombs ofThebes.298 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. VI.that number to the lyre, which he says correspondedto the three seasons of the year. Its invention heattributes to Hermes or Mercury *, who taught menletters, astronomy, and the rites of religion, andwho gave the instrument three tones, — the treble,bass, and tenor ; the first to accord with summer,the second with winter, and the third with spring.That the Egyptian year was divided into threeparts, is abundantly proved by numerous hieroglyphicinscriptions, as well as by the authority ofGreek writers ; and each season consisted of fourmonths of thirty days each, making a total of threehundred and sixty days in the year. To these wereadded five more at the end of the twelfth month ;and every fourth, or leap year, another intercalaryday increased this number to six, and thereby regulatedthe calendar, in the same manner as at thepresent day. tThat Diodorus confounds the guitar with thelyre, is probable, from his attributing its origin toMercury, who was always the supposed inventor ofthe latter ; though there is reason to believe thatthe same fable was told him by the Egyptians, inconnection with the other three-stringed instrument,and that it led to his mistake respecting thelyre.It was no doubt from a conviction of the greattalent required for the invention of an instrumentDiod.i. 16.,-j- Vide the appendix of my Materia Hieroglyphics ; and Diodorus, i.50. , who mentions this quarter day, and who " visited Eg\-pt in thereign of Ptolemy News Dionysus." i. 44.CHAP.

It does not appear to have had anybridge ; but the chords were fastened at the lowerend to a triangular piece of wood or ivory, whichraised them to a sufficient height ; and in some ofthose represented in the sculptures, we find theywere elevated at the upper extremity of the handle,by means of a small cross-bar, immediately beloweach of the apertures where the strings were tightened.This answered the same purpose as thedepressed end of our modern guitar ; and, indeed,since the neck was straight, some contrivance ofthe kind was absolutely necessary.It is true that the paintings do not indicate theexistence of pegs m this instrument for securingand bracing the strings, but their common use inthe harps and batteries strongly argues their adoptionin the guitar ; and it is more probable thatthe artist may have omitted them, than that thetwo or four tassels attached to that part of thehandle should be the substitute for a more perfectmethod well known to them, and adopted in otherinstruments. In one instance, however, the stringsappear to have been each passed through a separateaperture in the handle, and then bound round itand tied in a knot. *The length of the handle was sometimes twice,sometimes thrice, that of the body ; and I supposethe whole instrument to have measured about fourJ'ide wood-cut, No. 185.CHAP.

Three small holes indicatedthe place where the chords were secured, and twoothers, a short distance above, appear to have beenintended for fastening some kind of bridge ; butthis is merely conjecture, as I had not an opportunityof examining it, and am indebted to Mr. Madoxfor the accompanying sketch.No. 224.

There is no instance of it inthe sculptures of the ancient Egyptians, nor is itprobable that, even if known to them, it would havebeen admitted in their musical entertainments ;unless, indeed, it were used, as at present, for anaccompaniment in recitative.THE FLUTE (ti Aay/a-jXo^, 01' OBLIQUA TIBIa).The flute was at first very simple, and, as Horaceobserves, " with a few holes ; " the numberbeing limited to four, until Diodorus, of Thebes inBoeotia, added others ; improving the instrument,at the same time, by making a lateral opening forthe mouth. t It was originally of reed; but inJ.

It is impossible to say whetherthe Egyptians had one or several kinds of flutes,adapted, as with the Greeks *, to different purposes— some to mournful, others to festive occasions;but it is evident that they employed the fluteboth at banquets and in religious processions.Most of those used by the Greeks were borrowed,like their names, from Asia ; as the Lydian, Phrygian,Marian, and Mysian flutes ; and Olympus,the disciple of Marshal, introduced the instrumentfrom Phrygian into Greece, and was reputed bysome to have brought the lyre from the samecountry. Clonas, who lived many years after Ter-pander,was said to have been the first to inventlaws and suitable airs for the flute, though thesewere supposed to have been borrowed from theMyriads § ; and Pausanias ascribes || the constructionof the flute to Aratus, the son of VulcanAristotle, in mentioning Minerva as its inventor,merely alludes to one of the many allegorical fablesconnected with that goddess, Apollo, and Mercury;and the story of Minerva's throwing aside the flute,offended at the deformed appearance of her mouthPausanias mentions three, as being different, the Doric, Lydian, andPhrygian, Lib. ix.f Plut. de Musica.j Alexander on Phrygia, quoted by Plutarch, loc. cit.§ Plut. de Musica.II Pass.

" For," he adds, '* the flute is not suitedto improve morals, but is rather a bacchanalianinstrument, and very properly forbidden to be usedby young people and freemen. Nor was it tillafter the Persian war that the Greeks, inflated bythe pride of victory, laid aside their previous discrimination,and introduced all kinds of instruction,without consulting propriety or the maintenanceof morality ; forgetting that music is good, if ittends to guide and correct the mind of youth, buthighly prejudicial, when indulged in merely as apleasure."To Pronouns, of Thebes in Boeotia*, they wereindebted for an improvement in the instrument,by uniting the powers of three, the Doric, Lydian,and Phrygian, into one : but this may perhaps referto the double pipe ; and, as we have already observedin the harp and lyre, all the improvements,and the reputed invention of the instrument, datelong subsequently to that era when it had beenalready perfected among the Egyptians.Indeed, in the earliest sculptures, which arethose in the tomb of an individual behind the GreatPyramid, between three and four thousand yearsold, is a concert! of vocal and instrumental music,consisting of two harps, a pipe, flutes and severalvoices ; and during the reigns of the Pharaohs ofPans. lib. ix. f Vide wood-cut, No. 18.3.CHAP.

It was common to the Greeks * and otherpeople, and, from the mode of holding it, receivedthe name of right and left pipe, the tibia dextra andministry of the Romans, t The latter had but fewholes, and, emitting a deep sound, served as a bass.The other had more holes, and gave a sharptone; and for this purpose they preferred theupper part of the reed (when made of that material)for the right-hand pipe, and the lower part, nearthe root, for the left tubes To them, also, thename of auto* was applied by the Greeks, as wasthat of [j.ovau'Kog to the single pipe.In the paintings of Herculaneum, some of thedouble pipes are finished with pegs, fixed intothe upper side of each tube, towards the lowerextremity ; but it is difficult to ascertain the purposefor which they were intended.

Of its tone no very accurate notioncan be formed; but it is easy to conceive the generaleffect of an instrument emitting a tenor andbass at the same time. The modern Egyptianshave imitated it in their zummdra, or double reed ;but not, I imagine, with very great success, sinceit is both harsh and inharmonious, and of the rudestconstruction. Nor is it admitted, like the ancientdouble pipe, at festivals, where other instrumentsare introduced ; nor allowed to hold a rank in theirbands of music, humble and imperfect as they noware ; and its piping harshness and monotonousdrone are chiefly used for the out-of-doors entertainmentof the peasants, or as a congenial accompanimentto the tedious camel's pace.Many of the instruments of the ancients, whetherGreeks, Romans, or Jews, bore a noisy andinharmonious character ; and Lucian relates ananecdote of a young flute-player named HarmonVI. ANCIENT INSTRUMENTS OFTEN NOISY. 313niches, who, thinking to astonish and delight hisaudience, at the Olympic games, blew with suchviolence into the instrument, on which he wasperforming a solo, that, having completely exhaustedhimself, he died with the effort *, and maybesaid to have breathed his last into the flute.But that it was really a flute, seems highly improbable; and on this, and many other occasions,ancient writers appear to have confounded theinstrument with a species of clarion, or bell-mouthedpipe, which, being different from thestraight fistula, was comprehended under the moregeneral name of auT^og, or tibia. Of the clarionwe have no instance in the sculptures of Egypt ;and the modern inhabitants have probably derivedtheir clamorous and harsh-toned instrument fromsome model introduced by the Romans, or otherforeigners ; who, after the reign of Amasis, visitedor took possession of the country.Nor do we meet with that combination of longand short reeds, now known by the name of pan-pipest, in any of the musical scenes portrayed inthe tombs; which, from its having been used bythe Jews, we might expect to find in Egypt.

VI.its invention being said to date before the age ofNoah.THE TAMBOURINE.The tambourine was a favourite instrumentboth on sacred and festive occasions. It was ofthree kinds, differing, no doubt, in sound as well asform. One was circular, another square or oblong,and the third consisted of two squares separatedby a bar. * They were all beaten by the hand, andused as an accompaniment to the harp and otherinstruments.]wien and women played the tambourine; butit was more generally appropriated to the latter,as with the Jews; and they frequently danced toits sound, without the addition of any other music.It was of very early use in Egypt, and seems to havebeen known to the Jews t previous to their leavingSyria : being among the instruments mentioned byLaban, under its Hebrew name tape, the tar of themodern Arabs.From the imperfect representations of those inthe tombs of Thebes, it is difficult to say whetherthe Egyptian tambourine had the same moveablepieces of metal, let into its wooden frame, as inVide wood-cut, No. 236.-f- Exod.

It is evident, from the paintings at Herculaneum,that the Greek tambourine was furnishedwith balls of metal, pendent from the frontpart, or from the centre, of its circular rim, towhich each appears to have been attached by ashort thong ; and this instrument was mostly confinedto women, as with the Egyptians, and chieflyused by the Greeks in festivals of Bacchus andCybele.With the name of tambourine that of Anabasiswill always be connected; and, however improbablethe story, it has been very generally believed thathe fell a sacrifice to the indignation of his countrymen,in consequence of having introduced theinstrument into Scythia, when he returned fromGreece. Some, with more reason, suppose that anattempt to reform the laws of his country, afterthe Athenian model, was the cause of his death.SACRED MUSIC.Among the instruments of sacred music * maybereckoned the harp, lyre, flute, double pipe,tambourine, cymbals, and even the guitar; butneither the trumpet, drum, nor mace, were excitewool-cut, No. 229.THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS.CHAP.

They do not, however,appear to have been admitted, Hke the former,among those, whose introduction into the courtsof the temple was sanctioned on ordinary occasions; and perhaps the peculiar title of '* the holyinstrument" ought to be confined to the sistrum.The harp, lyre, and tambourine were oftenadmitted during the religious services of thetemple * ; and in a procession in honour of Author,represented on the frieze at Denderat, two goddessesare observed to play the harp and tam-withthe Jews, the harp, lute, and ten-stringed ashur, were employedin the praise of the Deity, as well as trumpets, cymbals, andother instruments.

The priests, bearingvarious sacred emblems, frequently advanced tothe sound of the flute f, and entered the temple tocelebrate their most important festivals ; and withthe exception of those of Osiris at Abydos t, thesacred rites of an Egyptian deity did not forbid theintroduction of the harp, the flute, or the voice ofsingers.At the fete of Diana, or Past, at Bubastis,music was permitted as on other similar occasions§ ; and Herodotus 11 mentions the flute andthe scrofula, which were played by the votaries ofthe goddess, on their way down the Nile to thetown where her far-famed temple stood. In theprocessions during the festival of Bacchus, the sameauthor says the flute-player goes first, and isfollowed by the choristers, who chant the praisesof the deity ; and we find the flute represented inthe sculptures in the hands of a sacred musicianattached to the service of Amun, who is in attendance,while the ceremonies are performed, inIn a painting at Herculaneum, representing a sacrifice in theTemple of Isis, the tambourine is introduced, and a man blowing whatappears to be the cornu or horn.f The flute is mentioned by Apuleius, in speaking of the mysteriesof Isis: — " Ibant et dicti magna Serapis tibicines, qui per obliquecalamus ad autem porrectum dextra, familiar temple denique modulusfrequentabant, et plerumque qui facile sacri via dare predicament."Metamorphic. lib. xi.

And that cymbals were appropriatedto the same purpose, we have sufficientreason for inferring, from their having been foundburied with an individual, whose coffin bears aninscription, purporting that she was the minstrelof Amun, the presiding deity of Thebes.Crotala were properly a sort of castanets, madeof hollow wooden shells ; and cymbals bore thename of crembala; but in some instances, as in thepassage of Herodotus, the name crotala appears tosignify cymbals. They were occasionally like ourclappers t for frightening birds ; and that Pausaniashad in view something of the kind is probable, fromthe use to which he supposes they were once appliedrequiring a much more powerful sound than thatproduced by castanets. " The birds of Stympha-lus," says that writer *, " which lived on humanflesh, are commonly fabled to have been destroyedby the arrows of Hercules; but Lysander, of Ca-minus,affirms that they were frightened away bythe noise of crotala."That the harp was a favourite instrument inreligious ceremonies, is evident from the assertionof Strabo, from the frequent mention of minstrelsof Amun, and other gods, in the hieroglyphiclegends placed over those who play that instrument,and from the two harpers in the presence of thesod Ao, before mentioned.The custom of approaching the holy place, andof singing the praises of the Deity, was not peculiarPausan. Arcade. lib. viii.-j- Represented in the Etruscan tombs.CHAP. VI. MUSIC CONNECTED WITH RELIGION. 319to the Egyptians. The Jews regarded music as anindispensable part of religion, and the harp held aconspicuous rank in the consecrated band.* Davidwas himself t celebrated as the inventor of musicalinstruments, as well as for his skill with the harp ;he frequently played it during the most solemnceremonies ; and we find that, in the earliest times,the Israelites used the timbrel, or tambourine, incelebrating the praises of the Deity ; Miriam therself, "a prophetess, and the sister of Aaron,"having used it, while chanting the overthrow ofPharaoh's host.With most nations it has been considered rightto introduce music into the service of religion ; andif the Egyptian priesthood made it so principal apart of their earnest inquiries, and inculcated thenecessity of applying to its study, not as an amusement,or in consequence of any feeling excited bythe reminiscences accompanying a national air,but from a sincere admiration of the science, andof its effects upon the human mind, we can readilybelieve that it was sanctioned, and even deemed indispensable,in many of their religious rites. Hencethe sacred musicians were of the order of priests,and appointed to this service, like the Levitess §,2 Sam. vi. 3. " And David and all the house of Israel played beforethe Lord, on all manner of instruments, made of Firewood, even onharps, and on batteries, and on timbers, and on cornets, and on cymbals."-f- Amos, vi. 5.

IG.320 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. VI.among the Jews ; and the Egyptian sacred bandswere probably divided, and superintended, in thesame manner as among that people.At Jerusalem " Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthunwere the three directors of the music of the tabernacle,under David, and of the temple, under Solomon.Asaph had four sons, Jeduthun six, andHeman fourteen.These twenty-four Levitess, sons of the threegreat masters of sacred music, were at the head oftwenty-four bands of musicians, who served thetemple in turns. Their number there was alwaysgreat, especially at the grand solemnities. Theywere ranged in order, about the altar of burntsacrifices. Those of the family of Kohath were inthe middle, those of Merari at the left, and those ofGershom on the right hand. The whole businessof their life was to learn and practise music; andbeing provided with an ample maintenance, nothingprevented their prosecuting their studies,and arriving at perfection in the art. Even in thetemple, and in the ceremonies of religion, femalemusicians were admitted as well as men ; and theywere generally the daughters of Levitess. Hemanhad three daughters, who were proficient in music;and the 9th Psalm is addressed to Benaiah, chiefof the band of young women, who sang in thetemple.Ezra, in his enumeration of those he brought backfrom the captivity, reckons two hundred singingmen and singing women ; and Zechariah, Ariel, andCHAP. VI. MUSICIANS PRIESTESSES. 3^1Shemiramoth*, are said to have presided over theseventh band of music, which was that of theyoung women." tIn many other places, mention is made of women,who sang, and played on instruments t ; and thefact of some of them being the daughters of priests,and of the first families, is analogous to the customof the Egyptians, who only admitted those of thepriests, and kings, into the service of the temple.Herodotus states, indeed, that women were notallowed in Egypt to become priestesses of any godor goddess, the office being reserved exclusively formen § ; but though it is true that the higher functionsof the priesthood belonged to these last, asfar as regarded the slaying of victims, presentingofferings, and other duties connected with thesacrifices, yet it is equally certain that women werealso employed in the service of the temple, andwere even, according to the historian himself, sofully instructed in matters appertaining to religion,that two, who had been carried away and sold intoLibya and Greece, were enabled to institute oraclesin those countries.

VI.THE DANCE.The dance consisted mostly of a succession offigures, in which the performers endeavoured toexhibit a great variety of gesture : men and womendanced at the same time, or in separate parties,but the latter were generally preferred, from theirsuperior grace and elegance. Some danced toslow airs, adapted to the style of their movement :the attitudes they assumed frequently partook ofa grace, not unworthy of the Greeks ; and somecredit is due to the skill of the artist who representedthe subject, which excites additionalinterest from its being in one of the oldest tombs ofThebes.* Others preferred a lively step, regulatedby an appropriate tune; and men sometimes dancedwith great spirit, bounding from the ground t,more in the manner of Europeans than of an Easternpeople. On these occasions, the music wasnot always composed of many instruments, andhere we only find the cylindrical maces, and awoman snapping her fingers to the time t in lieu ofcymbals or castanets.Graceful attitudes and gesticulation were thegeneral style of their dance ; but, as in all othercountries, the taste of the performance variedaccording to the rank of the person by whom theywere employed, or their own skill ; and the danceOf the time of Amunoph II., B.C. 1450.

With the Greeks, it was alsocustomary at feasts, to have women who professedmusic and dancing to entertain the guests ; theyeven looked upon the dance as a recreation, inwhich all classes might indulge, and deemed it anaccomplishment becoming a gentleman : it is,therefore, not surprising that, like music, it shouldhave formed part of their education.The Romans, on the contrary, were far from consideringit worthy of a man of rank, or of a sensibleperson j and Cicero says *, " No man who is soberdances, unless he is out of his mind, either whenalone or in any decent society ; for dancing is thecompanion of wanton conviviality, dissoluteness,and luxury." Nor did the Greeks indulge in it toexcess ; and effeminate dances were deemed indecent,in men of character and wisdom. Indeed,Herodotus informs us, that Hippocrates, theAthenian, who had been preferred before all thenobles of Greece, as a husband for the daughter ofClisthenes, king of Argos, was rejected on accountof his extravagant gestures in the dance.Of all the Greeks, the loans were most notedfor their fondness of this art ; and, from the wantonand indecent tendency of their songs and gesticulations,dances of a voluptuous character, likethose of the modern Almost of the East, wereCicero.

Jupiter, ** the father of gods andmen," is represented dancing in the midst of theother deities ; and Apollo is not only introducedby Homer thus engaged, but received the title ofop;^>3o-T7)f, '* the dancer," from his supposed excellencein the art. In early ages, before the introductionof luxury, it was an innocent recreation ;and, as Athenseus t observes, ** becoming of personsof honour and wisdom ; " but extravagantgesture corrupted its original simplicity t, and " nopart of the art connected with music," says Plutarch§, *' has, in our time, suffered so great a degradationas dancing."Fearing lest it should corrupt the manners ofa people, naturally lively, and fond of gaiety, anddeeming it neither a necessary part of education,nor becoming a person of sober habits, the Egyptiansforbade those of the higher classes to learn itas an accomplishment, or even as an amusement ;and, by permitting professional persons to be in-violinand tambourine, singing and repeating verses. They were formerlylearned women, whence their name Eulmeh, who rehearsed poetry,and danced to amuse the inmates of a harem. Their general appellationat the present day, Ghowazeh, is derived from Ghoos (warriors), atitle of the Memlooks, at whose festive meetings they used to dance,and through whom they have lost the consideration they formerly enjoyed.• Hor. : — " Motus doceri gaudet tonicsMatura virgo " Od. lib. iii. 6. 21.+ Athen. i. 19.J Dancing was highly approved of by Socrates, as being conduciveto health.

If those who were hired to perform,either in public or in private, transgressed thebounds of moderation, or descended to buffoonery,it might excite the contempt of those it failed toplease, yet the beholders were innocent of thefault; and any word or action, offending againstthe rules of decency, might be checked by theveto of their superiors.In private, in particular, they were subject tothe orders and censure of the persons by whomthey were employed ; and, consequently, avoidedany gesture or expression which they knew to beunwelcome, or likely to give offence to the spectators; and thus no improper innovations were attempted,from the caprice of a performer. Theyconsulted the taste of the party, and adapted thestyle of dance and of gesture to those whose approbationthey courted : it is not, therefore, surprisingthat excesses were confined to the inferiorclass of performers, at the houses of the lowerorders, whose congenial taste welcomed extravagantbuffoonery and gesticulation.CHAP. VT. EARLY USE OF THE PIROUETTE. 333Grace in posture and movement was the chiefobject of those employed at the assembles of therich ; and the ridiculous gestures of the buffoonwere permitted there, so long as they did not transgressthe rules of decency and moderation. Musicwas always indispensable, whether at the festivemeetings of the rich or poor ; and they danced tothe sound of the harp, lyre, guitar, pipe *, tambourine,and other instruments, and, in the streets,even to the drum.Many of their postures resembled those of themodern ballet; and the pirouette delighted anEgyptian party upwards of 3500 years ago.tThe dresses of the female dancers were light,and of the finest texture, showing, by their transparentquality, the forms and movement of thelimbs : they generally consisted of a loose flowingrobe, reaching to the ankles, occasionally fastenedtight at the waist ; and round the hips was a smallnarrow girdle, adorned with beads, or ornamentsof various colours. Sometimes the dancing figuresare represented without any indication of dress,and appear to have been perfectly naked ; but it isdifficult to say if this is intentional, or if the outlineof the transparent robe t has been effaced ; and itis sometimes so faintly traced as scarcely to be perceived,even when the paintings are well preserved :for we can scarcely suppose that a highly civilisedConf.

VI.people, like the Egyptians, were so depraved as toadmit, or to allow their artists to record, a danceof naked women, in the presence of men, or thatthe priesthood would permit such exhibitions.Slaves were taught dancing as well as music ;and in the houses of the rich, besides their otheroccupations, that of dancing to entertain thefamily, or a party of friends, was required of them ;and that free Egyptians, who gained their livelihoodby their performances, were also engaged atprivate parties, is evident from the paintings,where they are distinctly pointed out, by havingthe usual colour of their compatriots.Some danced by pairs, holding each other'shands ; others went through a succession of stepsalone*, whether men or women ; and sometimes aman performed a solo to the sound of music, or theclapping of hands, tFeats of agility and strength were frequently exhibitedon these occasions, with or without thesound of music. Some held each other by thehand, and whirled round at arms' length, in oppositedirections X ; some lifted each other off theground in various difficult attitudes, and attemptedevery species of feat, which could be performed byagility or strength ; but as these enter more properlyunder the denomination of games, I shall notintroduce them here, but shall notice them inanother place, with the gymnastic exercises of theEgyptians.• Vide wood-cut, No. 238. f Vide wood-cut, No. 239.J Vide wood-cut, No. 240.THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS.CHAP. VI.The dances of the lower orders appear generallyto have had a tendency towards a species of pantomime; and we can readily conceive the rudepeasantry to be more delighted with ludicrous andextravagant dexterity, than with those gestureswhich displayed elegance and grace.

Hieroglyphic signifying the dance.been adopted in the hieroglyphics, as the emblematicmode of describing the dance.In another step they struck the ground with theheels, standing on one foot, changing, perhaps,alternately from the right to the left ; which is notvery unlike a dance I have seen at the present day.Wood-cut, No. 240. fg. 6. a and b.f Tt puts us in mind of theGaudet invisam pelisse fossorTer pede terrain " —in Hor.

MODE OF DANCING. 339To manage the hands skilfully, and with grace,was of paramount importance, not only with theEgyptians, but with other ancient people; andPlutarch mentions a person* who was commendedfor his superiority in this species of gesture. Norwould it be inconsistent to divide the art of dancingwith the Egyptians, as with the Greeks, into threedistinct parts ; and its connection with poetry andsongs was probably exactly similarThe restrictions which forbade the higher ranksto indulge in the dance, do not appear to haveextended to the lower orders ; and, when excesseswere committed by them in wine, or any otherintoxicating beverage, they gave way to licenceand wanton buffoonery, and frequently gratified apropensity for ribaldry t, which is not unusual inEastern countries. On these occasions they whirledeach other round with rude dexterity ; and some,with folded arms, stood upon their head, and performedthe varied antics of expert tumblers.Like the Greeks, the Jews did not consider itunworthy of a person of rank to dance, either onsolemn or festive occasions ; and this is sufficientlyshown by the remarkable instances of David, andthe daughter of HerodiasPlut. Sympos. viii. 15. He, perhaps, only refers to the palaestra,and not to the dance, of which he is treating in this chapter ; but hementions the use of the hands in a subsequent part.-f- Plut. loc. cit.J At the fete of Bubastis even the women did so, without the excuseof being heated with wine, and that, too, on the occasion of a religiousfestival. Herod, ii. 60.§ Matt. xiv. 6.z 2340 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. VI.SACRED DANCINGThat they also danced at the temples, in honourof the gods, is evident from the representations ofseveral sacred processions, where individuals performedcertain gestures to the sound of suitablemusic, and danced as they approached the precinctsof the sacred courts. In what this differedfrom that of ordinary festivities, it is impossible todecide ; and, indeed, the appearance of the figures,in more than one instance, precisely the same asthe usual hieroglyphic signifying dancing, may besupposed to indicate a great similarity between theordinary dance and that of the temple.Such a custom may at first sight appear inconsistentwith the gravity of religion : but our surpriseceases, when we recollect with what feelings Davidhimself danced* before the ark ; and the fact thatthe Jews considered it part of their religiousduties to approach the Deity with the dance t,with tabret and with harp, suffices to remove anyobjection which might be offered to the probabilityof its introduction in the Egyptian ceremonies.And if further proof were wanting, we have theirmode of worshipping the golden calf t, immediatelyderived from the country they had left, whichconsisted principally of songs and dancing.I Chron. xv. 29. 2 Sam. vi. 14.f Psalm xlix. 3.

Butthey are purely Egyptian, and were universallyadopted in the Valley of the Nile, long before thepeaceful forms we admire were known in Greece :a fact invariably acknowledged by those who areacquainted with the remote age of Egyptian monuments,and the period when the paintings representingthem were executed in the tombs, ortemples, of the Thebaid.Some indeed of the most elegant date in theearly age of the third Thothmes, a monarch whoappears to have lived about the year 1490 beforeour era, and whom I assume to be the Pharaoh ofthe Jewish Exodus : and we not only admire theirforms but the richness of the materials of whichthey were made, the colours and the hieroglyphicsthemselves showing them to have been of gold and<JllM>. \U.VASES.S4.S;m\\\\\\\\\\iiM(/zg77^No. 244.

Among these we readily distinguishthe green emerald, the purple amethyst,and other gems ; and when an animal's headadorned their handles, the eyes were frequentlycomposed of them, except when enamel, or somecoloured composition, were employed as a substitute.That the Egyptians made great use of preciousstones for their vases, and for women's necklaces,rings, bracelets, and other ornamental purposes,is evident from the paintings at Thebes, and fromthe numerous articles of jewellery discovered in thetombs ; they were among the presents brought bythe conquered nations tributary to the Egyptians ;and their value and nature are indicated by thez 4344 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS.

Thebes.Many of the bronze vases found at Thebes,and in other parts of Egypt, are of a qualitywhich cannot fail to excite admiration, and provethe skill possessed by the Egyptians in the art ofworking and compounding metals. We are surprisedat the rich sonorous tones they emit on beingstruck, the fine polish of which they are frequentlysusceptible, and the high finish given them by theworkmen : nor are the knives and daggers, madeof the same materials, less deserving of notice ; theelastic spring they possessed, and even retain tothe present day, being such as could only be lookedfor in a blade of steel. I believe the exact proportionsof the copper and alloys, in the differentspecimens preserved in the museums of Europe,have not yet been ascertained ; but it would becurious to know their composition, particularlythe interesting dagger of the Berlin collection,which is as remarkable for the elasticity of itsblade, as for the neatness and perfection of itsfinish.

The Egyptians,we are informed by Herodotus, like theGreeks and Romans, occasionally employed skinsfor holding wine, as well as water, especially whenremoving it from one place to another ; and thefact, that the robber of Rhampsinitus's* treasuryadopted the same method of carrying his wine inskins, at a time when any unusual custom wouldnecessarily have been avoided, shows it to havebeen one of common occurrence. It is, however,doubtful, if leather bottles were applied to the samepurpose; and as we do not find them introduced atparties, it may be inferred, that they were neitherintended for drawing wine from the amphorae, norfor handing it to table.Bottles and narrow-mouthed vases, placed in thesitting room, and holding water, were frequentlyHerod, ii. 121.CHAP.

Sometimes an accidentoccurring at the house afforded an additional subjectfor remark ; and, as at the feast of the richNasidienus, the fall of a dusty curtain, or someill-secured piece of furniture, induced many tooffer condolences to the host, while others indulgedin the criticisms of a sarcastic Balatro.\A circumstance of this kind is represented in aVide infra, wood-cut, No. 279.f Her, Sat. ii. 8. 64. :Varius kappa composure risusVix potent.

A party, assembled at the houseof a friend, are regaled with the sound of music,and the customary introduction of refreshments ;and no attention which the host could show hisvisitors appears to be neglected on the occasion.The wine has circulated freely, and asthey are indulging in amusing converse, a youngman, perhaps from inadvertence, perhaps fromthe effect of intemperance, reclining with hiswhole weight against a column in the centre ofthe apartment, throws it down upon the assembledguests ; who are seen, with uplifted hands endeavouringto protect themselves, and escape fromits fall.*Many similar instances of a talent for caricatureare observable in the compositions of Egyptianartists, who executed the paintings of the tombs ;and the ladies are not spared. We are led to infer,that they were not deficient in the talent of conversation; and the numerous subjects they proposed,are shown to have been examined with greatanimation. Among these, the question of dresswas not forgotten, and the patterns or the value oftrinkets were discussed with proportionate interest.The maker of an ear-ring, or the shop where it waspurchased, were anxiously inquired ; each comparedthe workmanship, the style, and the materialsof those she wore, coveted her neighbour's,or preferred her own ; and women of every classvied with each other in the display of 'jewelsI regret exceedingly having mislaid the copy I made of this amusingsubject.CHAP.

Mutton, it is supposed,was unlawful food to the inhabitants of the Thebaid: and Plutarch affirms * that " no Egyptians,except the Lycopolites, eat the flesh of sheep ;"while Strabo confines the sacrifice of this animal tothe nome of Nitriotis. t But though we do notfind from the sculptures that sheep were killed forthe altar or the table, it is evident they aboundedin Egypt, and even at Thebes, being frequentlyrepresented in the tombs ; and large flocks areshown to have been kept, especially in the vicinityof Memphis. Sometimes they amounted to morethan 2000 : and in a tomb below the Pyramids,974 rams are brought to be registered by hisscribes, as part of the stock of the deceased ; implyingan equal number of ewes, independent oflambs, which in the benign climate of Egypt weretwice produced within the space of one year, tBeef and goose constituted the principal partof the animal food throughout Egypt ; and by aprudent foresight, in a country possessing neitherextensive pasture lands, nor great abundance ofcattle, the cow was held sacred, and consequentlyforbidden to be eaten. § And thus the risk ofPlut. de Ibid. s. 72.

An endless succession of vegetables was alsorequired on all occasions, and, when dining in private,dishes of that kind were in greater requestthan joints, even at the tables of the rich : we aretherefore not surprised to find the Israelites, who,by their long residence there, had acquired similarhabits, regretting them equally with the meat andfish*, which they " did eat in Egypt freely'* andthe advantages of a leguminous diet are still acknowledgedby the inhabitants of modern Egypt.This, in a hot climate, is far more conducive tohealth than the constant introduction of meat,which is principally used to flavour the vegetablescooked with it ; and if at an Eastern feast a greaterquantity of meat is introduced, the object is ratherto do honour to the guests, who, in most countries,and all ages, have been welcomed by an encouragementof excess, and a display of such things asshow a desire on the part of the host to spare noexpense in their entertainment.Numbers, xi. 4, 5.VOL. II. B IJ370 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. VII.The same custom prevailed with the ancientEgyptians ; and their mode of eating was very similarto that now adopted in Cairo, and throughoutthe East, each person sitting round a table, anddipping his bread into a dish placed in the centre,removed on a sign made by the host, and succeededby others, whose rotation depends on establishedrule, and whose number is predetermined accordingto the size of the party, or quality of the guests.Among the lower orders, vegetables constituteda very great part of their ordinary food, and theygladly availed themselves of the variety and abundanceof esculent roots growing spontaneously, inthe lands irrigated by the rising Nile, as soon as itswaters had subsided ; some of which were eatenin a crude state, and others roasted in the ashes,boiled, or stewed : their chief aliment, and that oftheir children, consisting of milk and cheese*,roots +, leguminous, cucurbitaceous, and otherplants, and ordinary fruits of the country. Herodotusdescribes the food of the workmen, whobuilt the Pyramids, to have been the " raphanus orfiglX, onions, and garlic ;" yet, if these were amongthe number they used, and, perhaps, the sole provisionssupplied at the government expense, wearenot to suppose they were limited to them :and it is probable that lentils, of which it is inferredfrom Strabo they had an abundance on thisDiod. i. 87. f Ibid. 80.J Herod, ii. 125.

Pliny t observes that the valley of" Nee Pelusiacae ceram spernabere lentils." Virgg. Georg. i. 228.f " Duo genera ejus (lentils) in Egypt."

Elf.the Nile " surpassed every other country in theabundance and spontaneous growth of those herbs,which most people are in the habit of using as food,especially the Egyptians ; " and at the time of theArab invasion, when Alexandria was taken by Amer,the lieutenant of the caliph Omer, no less than 4000persons were engaged in selling vegetables in thatcity.The lotus, the papyrus, and other similar productionsof the land, during and after the inundation,were, for the poor, one of the greatestblessings nature ever provided for any people ; and,like the acorn * in northern climates, constitutedperhaps the sole aliment of the peasantry, at theearly period when Egypt was first colonised. Thefertility of the soil, however, soon afforded a morevaluable produce to the inhabitants ; and longbefore they had made any great advances in civilisation,corn and leguminous plants were, doubtless,grown to a great extent throughout thecountry. The palm was another important giftbestowed upon them : it flourished spontaneouslyin the valley of the Nile, and, if it was unable togrow in the sands of the arid desert, yet whereverwater sufficed for its nourishment, this useful treeproduced an abundance of dates, a wholesomeand nutritious fruit, which might be regarded asConf.

Juvenal saysthey were forbidden to eat the onion *, and it isreported to have been excluded from an Egyptiantable. The prohibition, however, seems only tohave extended to the priests, who, according toPlutarch t, " abstained from most kinds of pulse ; "and the abhorrence felt for onions, according tothe same author t, was confined to the members ofthe sacerdotal order.That onions were cultivated in Egypt, is provedfrom the authority of many writers, as well asfrom the sculptures ; their quality was renownedin ancient as well as modern times ; and theIsraelites, when they left the country, regrettedthe onions" as well as the cucumbers, the melons,the leeks, the garlick, and the meat § they " dideat" in Egypt. Among the offerings presentedto the gods, both in the tombs and temples,onions are introduced, and a priest is frequentlyseen holding them in his hand, or covering analtar with a bundle of their leaves and roots. 11Juv. xiv. 9.

VII.Nor is it less certain that they were introduced atprivate as well as public festivals ; and brought totable with gourds, cucumbers, and other vegetables; and if there is any truth in the notion oftheir being forbidden, we may conclude it wasentirely confined to the priestly order.The onions of Egypt were mild, and of anexcellent flavour, and were eaten crude as wellas cooked, by persons both of the higher and thelower classes ; but it is difficult to say if they introducedthem to table like the cabbage, as a to stimulate the appetite, which Socratesrecommends in the Banquet of Xenophon. Onthis occasion some curious reasons for their useare brought forward by different members of theparty. Nitrates observes that onions relish wellwith wine, and cites Homer in support of his remark: Calls affirms that they inspire courage inthe hour of battle : and Charades suggests theirutility " in deceiving a jealous wife, who, findingher husband return with his breath smelling ofonions would be induced to believe he had notsaluted any one while from home."THE KITCHEN.In slaughtering for the table, it was customaryto take the ox, or whatever animal had been chosenfor the occasion, into a court-yard near the house ;to tie its four legs together, and then to throw itupon the ground ; in which position it was heldby one or more persons, while the butcher, sharp-chap.VII.SLAUGHTERING FOR TABLE.ending his broad knife upon a steel attached to hisapron, proceeded to cut the throat, as near as .273.

Nor is it less strictlydenounced by the Mohammedan religion ; and allMoslems look upon this ancient Egyptian andmodern European custom with unqualified horrorand disgust.The Israelites sometimes cut oft" the head at once.

The first joint removed was the right forelegor shoulder, the other parts following in succession,according to custom or convenience ; andthe same t rotation was observed in cutting up thevictims offered in sacrifice to the gods. Servantscarried the joints to the kitchen on wooden trays t,and the cook having selected the parts suited forboiling, roasting, and other 'modes of dressing,prepared them for the fire by washing, and anyother preliminary process he thought necessary.In large kitchens, the chef or head cook, hadseveral persons under him, who were required tomake ready and boil the water of the caldron, toput the joints on spits or skewers §, to cut up ormince the meats to prepare the vegetables, andto fulfil various other duties assigned to them.The very peculiar mode of cutting up the meatfrequently prevents our ascertaining the exact partthey intend to represent in the sculptures ; thechief joints, however, appear to be the head,shoulder, and leg, with the ribs, tail, or rump, theHerod, ii. 39. — '' a<pa^avT(Q Ce a—orafivovai ti)v Ki(pa\i]p, au)iiafxev St] tov KTr)VtoQ Stipovnt."f Levity. vii. 32.

One is remarkable, not onlyfrom being totally unlike any of our Europeanjoints, but from its exact resemblance to that commonlyseen at table in modern Egypt : it is partof the leg, consisting of the flesh covering the tibia,whose two extremities project slightly beyond it;and the accompanying drawing from the sculptures,and a sketch of the same joint taken by me at amodern table in Upper Egypt, show how the modeof cutting it has been preserved by traditionalcustom to the present day.No. 274.Peculiar joint of meat at an ancient and modern Egyptian table.The head was left with the skin and horns, andwas sometimes given away to a poor person as areward for holding the walking sticks of thoseguests who came on foot * ; in later times whenthe Greeks were settled in the country, it was soldto them, or to other foreigners : but it was frequentlytaken to the kitchen with the other joints ;and, notwithstanding the positive assertion of Herodotus,we find that even in the temples themselvesride wood-cut, No. 413. Plate 12. Jig. 10.378 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. VII.it was admitted at a sacrifice, and placed with otherofferings on the altars of the gods.The historian would lead us to suppose thata strict religious scruple prevented the Egyptiansof all classes from eating this part, as he affirms,that no Egyptian will taste the head of anyspecies of animal*, in consequence of certainimprecations having been uttered upon it at thetime it was sacrificed : but as he is speaking ofheifers slaughtered for the service of the gods, wemay conclude that the prohibition did not extendto those killed for table, nor even to all thoseoffered for sacrifice in the temple ; and as with thescapegoat of the Jews, that important ceremonywas perhaps confined to certain occasions and tochosen animals, without extending to every victimwhich was slain.The formula of the imprecation was probablyvery similar with the Jews and Egyptians. Herodotussays the latter pray the gods " that if anymisfortune was about to happen to those whooffered, or to the other inhabitants of Egypt, itmight fall upon that head:" and with the formerit was customary for the priest to take two goatsand cast lots upon them, "one lot for the Lordand the other lot for the scapegoat," which waspresented alive " to make atonement" for thepeople. The priest was then required to "layboth his hands upon the head of the live goat,and confess over him all the iniquities of thechildren of Israel, and all their transgressions in allHerod, ii. 39.CHAP.

In Abyssinia it is a sin toeat geese or ducks ; and modern experience teachesthat in Egypt, and similar climates, beef and gooseare not eligible food, except in the depth of winter.In Lower Egypt, or, as Herodotus styles it, thecorn country, they were in the habit of drying andsalting bu-ds of various kinds, as quails, ducks, andothers, a process to which I believe the sculpturesthemselves refer t ; and fish were prepared by themin the same manner both in Upper and LowerEgypt, tSome joints were boiled, others roasted : twomodes of dressing their food to which Herodotusappears to confine the Egyptians, at least in thelower country § ; but, though there is no positiveevidence from the sculptures that they adopteda very artificial kind of cookery, it is highly probablethey had made some advances in this as inthe other habits of a civilised, I may say, luxuriousConf.

Certain seeds were previouslysprinkled upon the upper surface of eachroll II, and judging from those still used in Egyptfor the same purpose, they were chiefly the tiigellasaliva, or kamoon asived^ the simsim ^, and thecaraway.Sometimes they kneaded the paste with theirfeet*, having placed it in a large wooden bowlupon the ground ; it was then in a more liquidstate than when mixed by the hand, and wascarried in vases to the pastry cook, who formed itinto a sort of macaroni, upon a flattened metal panover the fire. Two persons were engaged in thisprocess ; one stirred it with a wooden spatula, andthe other taking it off when cooked, with twopointed sticks tt, arranged it in a proper place,where the rest of the pastry was kept. This lastwas of various kinds, apparently made up withfruit, or other ingredients, with which the dough,spread out with the hand, was sometimes mixed,Wood-cut, No. 211., figs. 13. and 14. f Fig. 15,X As at the present day.

It isrepresented in the paintings of Herculaneum.CHAP. VII. SOCIETY OF MEN AND WOMEN. 389as he arrived, presented himself to receive theircongratulatory welcome *, and the musicians anddancers, hired for the occasion, did obeisance beforethem, previous to the performance of their part.To the leg of the fauteuil a favourite monkey, adog, gazelle, or some other pet animal t, was tied,and a young child was permitted to sit on theground at the side of its mother, or on its father'sknee. In some instances, we find men and womensitting together, both strangers t, as well as membersof the same family § ; a privilege not concededto females among the Greeks, except withtheir relations ; and this not only argues a verygreat advancement in civilisation, especially in anEastern nation, but proves, like many other Egyptiancustoms, how far this people excelled theGreeks in the habits of social life. With theRomans it was customary for women to mix insociety, and their notions on this head are contrastedby Cornelius Nepos with the scruplesof the Greeks, in these words : " Which of usRomans is ashamed to bring his wife to an entertainment?and what mistress of a family can beshown, who does not inhabit the chief and mostfrequented part of the house ? whereas, in Greece,she never appears at any entertainments, exceptthose to which relations are alone invited, and con-videPlate 12. f Ibid.J They may be married couples.§ Vide wood-cut, No. 279.y Cornel.

VII.SLAVES OFFERING WINE.which no man has admission, unless he be a nearrelation."Wine, as I have already observed, was presentedboth to matrons and virgins at an Egyptian feast ;and they were waited upon by handmaids and femaleslaves, as the men were attended by footmenand men slaves. An upper maid servant, or awhite slave, had the office of handing the wine, orwhatever refreshment was offered them, and ablack woman followed her, in an inferior capacity,to receive an empty cup when the wine had beenpoured from it into the goblet, or to bring andtake away what it was the privilege of the other topresent. The same black slaves brought the dishesas they were sent from the kitchen, and the peculiarmode of holding a plate with the hand reversed,so generally adopted by women from theinterior of Africa, is characteristically portrayed inthe paintings of a tomb at Thebes, given in the1 2 3No. 280.

The table was very similarto that of the present day in Egypt, which is asmall stool, supporting a round tray on which thedishes are placed, and it only differed from this inbeing raised upon a single leg, like many of thoseused for bearing offerings in the sacred festivals oftheir temples.In early times the Greeks as well as Romans,had similar round tables t, in imitation, as someVide wood-cut, No. 281., Jg. 12.■f Gen. xliii. 16.

No tray was used on the Egyptian table,nor was it covered by any linen || ; like that of theGreeks, it was probably wiped with a sponge ornapkin, after the dishes were removed, and polishedby the servants **, when the company had retired.There has long been a question respecting thecustom of reclining at meals, and its first introductionamong the Greeks and Romans.

Polished wood is frequently foundin the tombs of Thebes.CHAP. VII. CUSTOM OF RECLINING. 395have supposed that it came directly to Greecefrom Asia, and to Rome, after the conquest ofCarthage and Asia Minor : but it appears ratherto have been gradually introduced, than borrowedat any particular time from a foreign people. Withgreat reason, however, we may believe that thecustom originated in Asia * ; and the only noticeof it among the Greeks, in early times, is found insacred subjects, where' the deities are representedreclining on couches t, evidently with a view todistinguish their habits from those of ordinarymortals. But when luxury increased, and meninflated," as Aristotle observes, " with the prideof victory, laid aside their previous discrimination'*new modes of indulgence were devised, theirformer simplicity was abandoned, and customs wereintroduced which their ancestors considered suitedto the gods alone.That they derived their ideas respecting theuse of couches from a positive custom is certain,since all notions about the habits of the deitiescould only be borrowed from human analogies ;we may therefore safely ascribe to it a foreignorigin, though not introduced at once, or merelyadopted in imitation of an Eastern custom. Theprincipal person at a festival is often described ashaving reclined, while the others sat on chairs oron the ground. At the Roman fete of the EpulumJovis, Jupiter reposed on a couch, while theother deities were seated ; and, in Macedonia, noeneas and the Trojans reclined. Virgg. Ten. i. 700.■f The Ledislcntia of the Romans.396 THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS. CHAP. VII.one could recline at meals, till he had killed a boarwithout the help of nets. It was therefore, originally,a mark of honour and distinction, and sometimesconfined to men ; but in process of time itbecame general, and was afterwards adopted by allranks. For we have evidence from many ancientauthorities, that in early times neither the Greeksnor Romans reclined at meals. Homer's heroes*sat on the ground, or on chairs ; Virgil t, Tacitus,Ovid, Philo, and others mention the same primaevalcustom ; and Suetonius § says that even thegrand-children of Augustus "always sat at the endof the couch when they supped with him."The ordinary Egyptian round table was similarto the 7nonopodium of II the Romans, and insteadof the movable tray used by the modern Egyptians,its circular summit was fixed to the leg onwhich it stood ; which, as I have before observed,frequently presented the figure of a man, generallya captive, who supported the slab upon his head,the whole being either of stone, or some hardwood.On this the dishes were placed, togetherwith loaves of bread ^, some of which were, apparently,not unlike those of the present day, flat andHomer, Od. i. 108., &c. " Hjutvoi,"•j- Virgg. Mn. i. 176. " South patris considered mensis."t Ovid. Fast. \\. 305.§ Suet. Aug. c. 64. " Neque coenavit una, nisi in imo recto adherent."II Vide Juv.

THE USE OF WHEAT BREAD. 39?round*, as our crumpets, and others in the formof rolls or cakes, sprinkled with the seeds beforenoticed.In the houses of the rich bread was made ofwheat, the poorer classes being contented withbarley, and flour of the sorghum f ; for Herodotus,as I have had occasion to observe in a formerwork, has been guilty of an error in stating §that it was considered among the Egyptians "thegreatest disgrace" to live on wheat and barley, andthat " they therefore made their bread of theolt/ra\\, which some call zea."% It is doubtfulwhether the historian had in view the triticum zectywhich is now no longer grown in Egypt, or thesorghum*, the doura of the present day; but itis probable that he gives the name of olyra to thislast ; and that it was grown in ancient times inUpper and Lower Egypt, particularly about theThebaid, is evident from the sculptures, thoughnot in the same quantity as wheat. So far, how-theseretain the form of the old " cake," baked " upon thehearth " (Gen. xviii. 6.), which are so generally used at this day by theArabs of the desert, without leaven. The bread of Upper Egypt ismore like the ancient Egyptian cake.f Hocus Sorghum, Linn. f "Egypt and Thebes," p. 213.§ Herod, ii. 36.II Pliny (xviii. 7.) says, " Far in egypt ex olyra confucius ; " butnot to the exclusion of any other grain ; and we find in the same author," jEgyptus . . . e critics suo." He also observes, that the olyra hadbeen supposed the same as rice, " olyram et oryzam eadem esse existing;"and afterwards (c. 8.), distinguishes it from the sea, withwhich Herodotus has confounded it. Homer feeds horses on the olyra,as well as wheat and barley ; which last is now given them in the East.Homer, II. E. 196.IT Bearing no relation to the sea mays, or Indian corn.** The Assyrian wheat and barley, he affirms, had " leaves fourfingers in breadth," from which it has been conjectured that he there(Ub. i. 193.) alludes to the sorghum ; but the expression " wheat andbarley," renders this very questionable.THE Ancient Egyptians.CHAP. VII.ever, were the Egyptians from holding wheat andbarley in abhorrence, that they cultivated themabundantly throughout the whole valley of theNile*, offered them to the gods, and derived fromthem a great part of their sustenance, in commonwith whatever other corn the soil produced ; andI fear that this, and his assertion respecting theexclusive use of brazen drinking cups, proveHerodotus not to have lived in the best societyduring his stay in Egypt, tNo. 282. Drinking cups.Fig. 1. An alabaster beaker, in the Museum of Alnwick Castle.2. A saucer or cup of blue glazed pottery, in the Berlin Collection.3. Side view of the same.The drinking cups of the Egyptians, as I havealready observed, were of gold, silver, glass, porcelain,alabaster, bronze, and earthenware.Witness the sculptures, and Exod, ix. 31, 32. ; " The barleywas smitten the wheat and the rye (?) were not smitten; forthey were not grown up." Wheat in Egypt is about a month laterthan barley.t Herod, ii. 37. Vise supra, p. 201.j If Herodotus had travelled, a few years ago, in the north ofour island, he might, perhaps, have made a similar remark about theEnglish and oat cakes.CHAP. VII. THE TABLES AND DISHES. 399They varied greatly in their forms : some wereplain and unornamented ; others, though of smalldimensions, were made after the models of largervases ; many were like our own cups withouthandles ; and others may come under the denominationof beakers and saucers. Of these theformer were frequently made of alabaster, with around base, so that they could not stand whenfilled, and were held in the hand, or when empty,were turned downwards upon their rim : and thelatter, which were of glazed pottery, had sometimeslotus or fish represented on their concave surface,which, when water was poured into the cups appearedto float in their native element. *The tables, as at a Roman repast, were occasionallybrought in and removed t with the dishes1 2No. 283.

The dishes consisted of fish ; meatboiled, roasted, and dressed in various ways ; game,poultry, and a profusion of vegetables and fruit,particularly figs and grapes, during the season ; anda soup, or pottage of lentils*, as with the modernEgyptians, was not an unusual dish. Of figs andgrapes they were particularly fond, which is shownby their constant introduction even among thechoice offerings presented to the gods ; and figs ofthe sycamore must have been highly esteemed,since they were selected as the heavenly fruit, givenby the goddess Nempe to those who were judgedworthy of admission to the regions of eternal happiness.Fresh dates during the season, and in adried state at other periods of the year, were alsobrought to table, as well as a preserve of the fruit,still so common in the country, some of which INo. 28i.

They were principally of ivory,bone, wood, or bronze, and other metals ; and insome the handle terminated in a hook, by which, ifrequired, they were suspended to a nails Manywere ornamented with the lotus flower ; the handlesof others were made to represent an animal, or ahuman figure ; some were of a very arbitrary shape ;and a smaller kind of a round form, probably intendedfor taking ointment out of a vase and transferringit to a shell or cup for immediate use, areoccasionally discovered in the tombs of Thebes.One in the Museum of Alnwick Castle is a perfectspecimen of these spoons, and is rendered moreinteresting from having been found with the shell,its companion at the toilet table, tSingula, or ladles, were also common, and manyhave been found at Thebes.

It is verysmall ; the lower part, which may be properly calledthe handle, being barely more than five incheslong, of very delicate workmanship ; and the slidingrod, which rises and falls in a groove extendingdown the centre of the handle, is about the thicknessof a needle.Small strainers, or hollanders, of bronze havealso been found at Thebes, but seldom more thanfive inches in diameter, one of which is in theBritish Museum, with several other utensils.Tliat they washed after as well as before dinner,we may be allowed to conclude from the invariableadoption of this custom throughout the East, andamong most nations of antiquity, as the Greeks ll,Wood-cut, No. 290.

VII.Romans*, Hebrews, and others: nor can we foramoment suppose that a people, peculiarly prepossessedin favour of repeated ablutions, wouldhave neglected so important an act of cleanlinessand comfort ; and Herodotus t speaks of a goldenbasin, belonging to Amasis, which was used by theEgyptian monarch, and " the guests who were inthe habit of eating at his table."The heat of a climate, like that of Egypt, naturallypointed out the necessity of frequent ablutions,and inclined them to consider the use ofwater an agreeable indulgence : and we frequentlyfind many of the modern natives, who are notobliged by a religious prejudice to observe thecustom of washing at meals, as particular in thisrespect as the Moslems themselves. §The Greeks, at a remote period of their history,were not so scrupulous in these matters, and werecontented to wipe their fingers, after meals, onpieces of bread-cum (ocTrofxayoaXiai'), which theythrew to the dogs||; but it is probable, that therefreshing habits of cleanliness always existed inVirgg. ^n. i. 701.: —Want manus famuli lyniphas."and Georg. iv. 377.Manus liquids cant ordines fontesGerman, tonsisque terunt niantilia vittis."•}■ The Pharisees " panelled that he had not first washed beforedinner."

But there is noevidence of soap having been used by the Egyptians; and if accident had discovered something ofthe kind, while they were engaged with mixturesof natron or potash, and other ingredients, it isprobable that it was only an absorbent, without oilor grease, and on a par with steatite, or the argillaceousearths, with which, no doubt, they werelong acquainted.We know that this scrupulously religious peoplewere never remiss in evincing their gratitude forConf.

VII.the blessings they enjoyed, and in returning thanksto the gods for that peculiar protection they werethought to extend to them and to their country,above all the nations of the earth. It cannot, therefore,be supposed, that they would have omitteda similar acknowledgment, previous to and aftermeals * ; and even if the impulse of their own feelingshad not dictated its propriety, the assiduouszeal of their spiritual pastors, who omitted nothingwhich could inspire the people with duerespect for the Deity, would not have failed to imposeupon them so important a duty. But on thispoint there is no need of conjecture : Joseph usexpressly states, that the custom of saying gracebefore meals was practised by the Egyptians ; andwhen the seventy-two elders were invited by PtolemyPhiladelphus to sup at the palace, Nicanor requestedEleazar to say grace for his countrymen,instead of those Egyptians, to whom that duty wascommitted on other occasions.! The Greeks, andother nations of antiquity, offered a part of whatthey were about to eat, as pi'imiticPj or first fruits t,to the gods ; and it is probable, that besides athanksgiving, the religious Egyptians commencedtheir repasts with a similar ceremony.We cannot suppose that this people were so ad-theMoslems, before eating, say " Besmillah," or " Best Allahbrahman e'raheem," " In the name of the kind and merciful God."On rising from table, each repeats the " El hamdoolilhih," " Praised beGod." From this use of the word besmiliali, they say, " Besmillahmana," " Will you in the name of God (i. e. eat) with us."■j- Vide Joseph. Antiij. xii. 2. 12.I Horn, II, k; 219. Odes. (.231.

But if they were fond ofluxury, and all the mirth in which a lively peoplenaturally indulge, if they banished religious thoughtsduring the hour of festivity, and allowed themselvesto give way to occasional intemperance, it is unjustto throw the stigma of immorality upon the wholenation; and few civilised communities of modernEurope would desire to be judged with the sameseverity.It was a custom of the Egyptians, during, oraccording to Herodotus, after their repasts, to introducea wooden image of Osiris t, from one footand a half to three feet in height, in the form of ahuman mummy, standing erect, as Plutarch informsus, in a case, or lying on a bier, and to show it toJosephus says " The Egyptians are a peevish, lazy set of people,abandoned to their pleasures, and their very souls set upon profit, letit come which way it will."

Thus, while the guests were permitted,and even exhorted to indulge in conviviality,the pleasures of the table, and the mirth so congenialto their lively disposition, the prudentsolicitude of the priests did not fail to watch overtheir actions, and, by this salutary hint, to showHerod, ii. 78.

After it had been producedupon the table two or three times, and hadbeen made, by means of springs, to assume differentattitudes, Trimalchio exclaimed *, * Alas,unhappy lot, how truly man is nought ! similar toTpo^og apfiaTOQ yap oiaBforot; rptxii KvXioOtig,OXty/j Ce Ktiaofit<y9aKoine, oaruov \v9tvruv'Ti at ?et XiOov fivpiZtiv ;Ti ^£ yy x*^'*" finraia ;F.fie fiaWov, wg in ^oj,M I'pifToi', poking Si ParaWvKaaov, koKu 6' iTaiptjv.n^jtv, Epwf, isti /m' airikQiivOtto viprtpoiv xofif(ttC>'S.KilaaaL ^iKio iii()i}.ivag"The rapid course is quickly' clone.And soon the race oflife is run.Then, then, alas ! we droop, we die,And sunk in dissolution lie :Our frame no symmetry retains.Nought but a little dust remains.Why o'er the tomb are odours shed ?Why pour'd libations to the dead ?To me far better, w hile I live.Rich wines and balmy fragrance give.Now, now, the rosy wreath prepare,And hither call the lovely fair.Now, while I draw my vital breath,Ere yet I lead the dance of death.For joy my sorrows I 'II resign,And drown my cares in rosy wine."And Hor. 2 Od. iii. 13. :Hue vina, et unguent, et nimium brevisFlores amends ferre jube ros,Dnm res, et aetas, et scrotumFila trim patiuntur aera."Petron.

For we are born at alladventure, and we shall be hereafter as though wehad never been, come on, therefore, let usenjoy the good things that are present, let usfill ourselves with costly wine and ointments; andlet no flower of the spring pass by us ; let us crownourselves with rosebuds, before they be withered ;let none of us go without his part of our voluptuousness; let us leave tokens of our joyfulness inevery place."The intent, however, of this custom, with theEgyptians, was widely different, and even if fromlong habit, and the increase of luxurious manners,the good warning it was intended to convey wasdisregarded, or failed in its effect, still the originalintention was good, and cannot, injustice, be condemnedas tending to immorality : and though Herodotus,who merely says, that the guests were requestedto " observe that man, whom they wouldall resemble after death," and were exhorted " todrink and enjoy themselves," omits to inform us,if it was intended to convey a moral lesson, Plu-bookof Wisdom, ii. 1. et seq.

The ideaof death, among the ancients, was less revoltingthan among Europeans and others, at the presentday ; and so little did the Egyptians object to haveit brought before them, that they even introducedthe mummy of a deceased relative at their parties,and placed it at table, as one of the guests ; a fact,which is recorded by Lucian*, in his " Essay onGrief," and of which he declares himself to havebeen an eyewitness.After dinner, music and singing were resumed ;men and women performed feats of agility, swingingeach other round by the hand ; or throwingup and catching the ball ; and the numerous tricksof jugglers, both in the house and out of doors, wereintroduced to amuse the company.Part of a similar scene, at a Greek entertainment,is described in the 'Banquet' of Xenophon. Alittle boy, two dancing girls, and a jester namedPhilip, were present on that occasion, and one ofthe former began by displaying her skill, in throwingup her cymbals, and catching them, to the tuneof a flute played by her companion. A hoop wasthen brought, round which a number of swordswere fixed, and the same dancing girl jumping inand out of the hoop, with perfect confidence, andwithout receiving any injury, afforded infinite delightand satisfaction to the guests j and gaveoccasion to Socrates, who was present, to make♦ And by Damascus, Orate. i.CHAP.

Thenstanding upright, she bent backwards, and touchingher heels with her head, flung herself roundswiftly three or four times, in imitation of a wheel;occasionally reading and writing at the same timethat she was going through this rotatory movement.Every one expressed his delight at this exhibitionof her agility ; and Philip pretending to imitateher, by throwing himself in the same manner forwards,offered a striking contrast to the graceshe had exhibited, and excited the ridicule of theparty.The singular feat here described is more interesting,as it bears some resemblance to one ofthose indicated in the paintings illustrating the customsof the Egyptians, at an era far more remote,dating no less than 1300 years before the age of Socrates; where women are represented turning overbackwards, either singly or in pairs. In the lattercase, the head of one was placed between the legsof the other, front to front, but in such a mannerthat when one was standing, the head of the otherwas downwards, and the feet over her neck ; andin this position they turned over, the feet of eachalternately reaching the ground.*The most usual games t within doors were, oddand even, mora, and draughts. The first of thesewas played also by the Romans, and called ** lu-thereis no appearance of the Cottages, so fully described byAthanasius, which was supposed to have passed from Sicily into Greece,f Wood-cut, No. 291.41(jTHE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS.

Such scenes cannotof course be looked for among the subjects ofthe Egyptian sculptures ; but that they were superstitiousobservers of accidental occurrences, and inferredfrom them the chance of certain results, isproved to us by the testimony of those who visitedthe country: for "whenever," says Herodotusany thing extraordinary occurs, they note it downin writing, and pay particular attention to the eventsConf.

Throwing and catching the ball,running, leaping, and similar feats, were encouraged,as soon as their age enabled them to indulgein them ; and a young child was amused withpainted dolls, whose hands and legs, moving onNo. 300.Wooden dollspins, were made to assume various positions bymeans of strings.* Some of these were of rudeand uncertain form, without legs, or with an imperfectrepresentation of a single arm on one side.Some had numerous beads, in imitation of hair.Conf.

In the toy of the crocodile,we have sufficient evidence that the erroneous notionof Herodotus, who states that this animal*' does not move the lower jaw, and is the onlycreature which brings the upper one down to thelower *," did not originate with the Egyptians :but we are not surprised at this assertion, when werecollect how easily the motion of the head of thecrocodile is mistaken for that of the upper jaw.Like other animals, it moves the lower jaw onlybut when seizing its prey, the head being thrownup, gives the appearance of motion in the upperjaw, and readily leads those who see it into thiserroneous conclusion.The game of ball t was not confined to children,or to either sex, though the mere amusement ofthrowing and catching it appears to have beenconsidered more particularly adapted to females, tThey had different methods of playing. § Sometimesa person unsuccessful in catching the ballwas obliged to suffer another to ride on her back,who continued to enjoy this post until she alsomissed it: the ball being thrown by an oppositeparty, mounted in the same manner, and placedat a certain distance, according to the space previouslyfixed by the players ; and, from the positionand office of the person who had failed, it is notHerod, ii. 68.\ Pliny says painting and the game of ball were invented in Egypt :Pythias pilam lusoriam, Gyges Lucius picture in egypt."Lib. vii. 36.X Not so with the Romans.J.

WRESTLING. 43?the spectator more readily to perceive the positionof the limbs of each combatant, the artist hasavailed himself of a dark and light colour, andeven ventured to introduce alternately a black andred figure. It is not, however, necessary to givean instance of every position indicated in thosevaried subjects ; and a selection of the principalgroups will suffice to convey some idea of theirmode of representing the combatants, and of theirgeneral system of attack and defence.It is probable that, like the Greeks, they anointedthe body with oil, when preparing for these exercises,and they were entirely naked, with the exceptionof a girdle, apparently of leathern thongs.The two combatants generally approached eachother, holding their arms in an inclined position beforethe body ; and each endeavoured to seize hisadversary in the manner best suited to his mode ofattack. It was allowable to take hold of any part ofthe body, the head, neck, or legs ; and the strugglewas frequently continued on the ground, after oneor both had fallen ; a mode of wrestling common alsoto the Greeks, by whom it was denominated .I do not find that they had the samesign of acknowledging their defeat in this game asthe Greeks, which was by holding up a finger, intoken of submission, and it was probably done bythe Egyptians with a word.They also fought with the single stick, thehand being apparently protected by a basket, orguard projecting over the knuckles; and on theleft arm they wore a straight piece of wood, boundF F 3THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS.CHAP.

One party attacked atemporary fort, and brought up the battering rant,under cover of the testudo ; another defended thewalls and endeavoured to repel the enemy ; others,in two parties of equal numbers, engaged in singlestick, or the more usual nebootty a pole wieldedwith both hands ; and the pugnacious spirit of thepeople is frequently alluded to in the scenes portrayedby their artists.The use of the neboot seems to have been ascommon among the ancient, as among the modern,Egyptians; and the quarrels of villages were oftendecided or increased, as at present, by this efficientweapon. Crews of boats are sometimes representedattacking each other with the earnestness of realThe Lucius Trojan of the Romans, Vide Virgg. ^n. v. 560.

Inmentioning the arms of the African enemies of Egypt, at the end ofVol. I., I omitted a remark of Pliny, that " the Africans were the firstpeople who used clubs, called " phalanges," during their wars withthe Egyptians.

Some are desperately wounded, and, beingfelled by their more skilful opponents, are thrownheadlong into the water ; and the truth of Herodotus'sassertion, that the heads of the Egyptians*were harder than those of other people, seemsfully justified by the scenes described by their owndraughtsmen ; and that this peculiarity has beeninherited by their successors is abundantly provedby modern experience.Many singular encounters with sticks are mentionedby ancient authors ; among which may benoticed that described by Herodotus, at Papremis,the city of Market When the votaries of the deitypresented themselves at the gates of the temple,their entrance was obstructed by an opposingparty ; and all being armed with sticks, they commenceda rude combat, which ended, not merelyin the infliction of a few severe wounds, but even,as the historian affirms, in the death of many personson either side, tIn buffoonery they also took great pleasure, andin witnessing the performances of those whodanced in the streets to the sound of a drum §,decorated with whatever could add to the extravaganceand ridicule of their appearance, as ribands,long pendent tassels, or fool's caps ; and,judging from a custom still common in Egypt, itHerod, iii. 12. f Herod, ii. 63.J Though, he adds, the Egyptians assured him the contrary.
