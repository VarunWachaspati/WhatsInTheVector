D.,CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Sir,I ask the favour of dedicating this work to you. I knownot, to whom it could with so much propriety be dedicated, asto one, whose youth was engaged in the arduous enterprises ofthe Revolution ; whose manhood assisted in framing and supportingthe national Constitution ; and whose maturer yearshave been devoted to the task of unfolding its powers, andillustrating its principles. When, indeed, I look back uponyour judicial labours during a period of thirty-two years, it isdifficult to suppress astonishment at their extent and variety,and at the exact learning, the profound reasoning, and the solidprinciples, which they every where display. Other Judgeshave attained an elevated reputation by similar labours in asingle department of jurisprudence. But in one department,(it need scarcely be said, that I allude to that of constitutionallaw,) the common consent of your countrymen has admittedyou to stand without a rival. Posterity will assuredly confirmby its deliberate award, what the present age has approved, asan act of undisputed justice. Your expositions of constitutionallaw enjoy a rare and extraordinary authority. They constitutea monument of fame far beyond the ordinary memorials ofpolitical and military glory. They are destined to enlighten,instruct, and convince future generations ; and can scarcelyperish but with the memory of the constitution itself. Theyare the victories of a mind accustomed to grapple with difficulties,capable of unfolding the most comprehensive truths withmasculine simplicity, and severe logic, and prompt to dissipatethe illusions of ingenious doubt, and subtle argument, and impassionedeloquence. They remind us of some mighty river ofIV DEDICATION.our own country, which, gathering in its course the contributionsof many tributary streams, pours at last its own currentinto the ocean, deep, clear, and irresistible.But I confess, that I dwell with even mOre pleasure uponthe entirety of a life adorned by consistent principles, andfilled up in the discharge of virtuous duty ; where there isnothing to regret, and nothing to conceal ; no friendships broken; no confidence betrayed ; no timid surrenders to popularclamour ; no eager reaches for popular favour. Who doesnot listen with conscious pride to the truth, that the disciple,the friend, the biographer of Washington, still lives, the uncompromisingadvocate of his principles ?I am but too sensible, that to some minds the time may notseem yet to have arrived, when language, like this, howevertrue, should meet the eyes of the public. May the period beyet far distant, when praise shall speak out with that fulness ofutterance, which belongs to the sanctity of the grave.But I know not, that in the course of providence the privilegewill be allowed me hereafter, to declare, in any suitableform, my deep sense of the obligations, which the jurisprudenceof my country owes to your labours, of which I havebeen for twenty-one years a witness, and in some humblemeasure a companion. And if any apology should be requiredfor my present freedom, may I not say, that at your ageall reserve may well be spared, since all your labours mustsoon belong exclusively to history ?Allow me to add, that I have a desire (will it be deemedpresumptuous ?) to record upon these pages the memory of afriendship, which has for so many years been to me a sourceof inexpressible satisfaction ; and which, I indulge the hope,may continue to accompany and cheer me to the close of life.I am with the highest respect,affectionately your servant,JOSEPH STORY.Cambridge, January, 1833.PREFACE.TO THE ORIGINAL WORK.I NOW offer to the public another portion of the labours devolvedon me in the execution of the duties of the Dane Professorshipof Law in Harvard University. The importance ofthe subject will hardly be doubted by any persons, who havebeen accustomed to deep reflection upon the nature and valueof the Constitution of the United States. I can only regret,that it has not fallen into abler hands, with more leisure to prepare,and more various knowledge to bring to such a task.Imperfect, however, as these Commentaries may seem tothose, who are accustomed to demand a perfect finish in allelementary works, they have been attended with a degreeof uninviting labour, and dry research, of which it is scarcelypossible for the general reader to form any adequate estimate.Many of the materials, lay loose and scattered ; and were tobe gathered up among pamphlets and discussions of a temporarycharacter ; among obscure private and public documents ;and from collections, which required an exhausting diligenceto master their contents, or to select from unimportant masses,a few facts, or a solitary argument. Indeed, it required nosmall labour, even after these sources were explored, to bringtogether the irregular fragments, and to form them into groups,in which they might illustrate and support each other.From two great sources, however, I have drawn by far thegreatest part of my most valuable materials. These are. TheFederalist, an incomparable commentary of three of the greateststatesmen of their age ; and the extraordinary Judgmentsof Mr. Chief Justice Marshall upon constitutional law. Theformer have discussed the structure and organization of thenational government, in all its departments, with admirable PREFACE.ness and force. The latter has expounded the application andlimits of its powers and functions with unrivalled profoundnessand felicity. The Federalist could do little more, than statethe objects and general bearing of these powers and functions.The masterly reasoning of the Chief Justice has followed themout to their ultimate results and boundaries, with a precisionand clearness, approaching, as near as may be, to mathematicaldemonstration. The Federalist, being written to meet themost prevalent popular objections at the time of the adoption ofthe Constitution, has not attempted to pursue any very exactorder in its reasoning ; but has taken up subjects in such amanner, as was best adapted at the time to overcome prejudices,and win favour. Topics, therefore, having a naturalconnexion, are sometimes separated; and illustrations appropriateto several important points, are sometimes presented inan incidental discussion. I have transferred into my ownpages all, which seemed to be of permanent importance in thatgreat work ; and have thereby endeavoured to make its meritsmore generally known.The reader must not expect to find in these pages anynovel views, and novel constructions of the Constitution. Ihave not the ambition to be the author of any new plan of interpretingthe theory of the Constitution, or of enlarging or narrowingits powers by ingenious subtleties and learned doubts.My object will be sufficiently attained, if I shall have succeededin bringing before the reader the true view of its powers maintainedby its founders and friends, and confirmed and illustratedby the actual practice of the government. The expositions tobe found in the work are less to be regarded, as my own opinions,than as those of the great minds, which framed the Constitution,or which have been from time to time called upon toadminister itx Upon subjects of government it has always appearedto me, that metaphysical refinements are out of place.A constitution of government is addressed to the common senseof the people ; and never was designed for trials of logicalskill, or visionary speculation.The reader will sometimes find the same train of reasoningbrought before him in different parts of these Commentaries.PREFACE. EllIt was indispensable to do so, unless the discussion was leftimperfect, or the reader was referred back to other pages, togather up and combine disjointed portions of reasoning. Incases, which have undergone judicial investigation, or whichconcern the judicial department, I have felt myself restrictedto more narrow discussions, than in the rest of the work ; andhave sometimes contented myself with a mere transcript fromthe judgments of the court. It may readily be understood, thatthis course has been adopted from a solicitude, not to go incidentallybeyond the line pointed out by the authorities.In dismissing the work, I cannot but solicit the indulgenceof the public for its omissions and deficiencies. With morecopious materials it might have been made more exact, as wellas more satisfactory. With more leisure and more learning itmight have been wrought up more in the spirit of politicalphilosophy. Such as it is, it may not be wholly useless, as ameans of stimulating abler minds to a more thorough reviewof the whole subject ; and of impressing upon Americans areverential attachment to the Constitution, as in the highestsense the palladium of American liberty.January, 1833.ADVERTISEMENT TO THE ABRIDGMENT.The present work is an abridgment, made by the author,of his original work, for the use of Colleges and High-schools.It presents in a compressed form the leading doctrines of thatwork, so far as they are necessary to a just understandingof the actual provisions of the constitution. Many illustrationsand vindications of these provisions are necessarily omitted.But sufficient are retained to enable every student tocomprehend and apply the great principles of constitutionallaw, which were maintained by the founders of the constitution,and which have been since promulgated by those, who have,from time to time, administered it, or expounded its powers.I indulge the hope, that even in this reduced form the reasoningVlll ADVERTISEMENT.in favour of every clause of the constitution will appear satisfactoryand conclusive ; and that the youth of my country willlearn to venerate and admire it as the only solid foundation,on which to rest our national union, prosperity, and glory.April, 1833.TABLE OF CONTENTS.PageThe Constitution xviiTable op Sections xxxvPreliminary Chapter 1BOOK I.HISTORY OF THE COLONIES.CHAPTER I.Origin and Tithe to the Territory of the Colonies 3-7 ^CHAPTER 11.Origin and Settlement of Virginia 8-12CHAPTER m.Origin and Settlement of New-england, and PlymouthColony 13-18CHAPTER IV.Massachusetts . . 19-27Abr.

All legislative powers herein granted, shall be vested inacongress of the United States, which shall consist of a senateand house of representatives.Section 2.1. The house of representatives shall be composed of memberschosen every second year by the people of the severalstates, and the electors in each state shall have the qualificationsrequisite for electors of the most numerous branch of thestate legislature.2. No person shall be a representative who shall not haveattained to the age of twenty-five years, and been sevenyears a citizen of the United States, and who shall not, whenelected, be an inhabitant of that state in which he shall bechosen.AyXvi THE CONSTITUTION.3. Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportionedamong the several states which may be included within thisUnion, according to their respective numbers, which shall bedetermined by adding to the whole number of free persons,including those bound to service for a term of years, andexcluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all other persons.The actual enumeration shall be made within three years afterthe first meeting of the congress of the United States, andwithin every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner asthey shall by law direct. The number of representatives shallnot exceed one for every thirty thousand, but each state shallhave at least one representative ; and until such enumerationshall be made, the state of New Hampshire shall be entitledto choose three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode Island and ProvidencePlantations one, Connecticut five. New York six. NewJersey four, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six,Virginia ten. North Carolina five, South Carolina five, andGeorgia three.4. When vacancies happen in the representation from anystate, the executive authority thereof shall issue writs of electionto fill such vacancies.5. The house of representatives shall choose their speakerand other officers ; and shall have the sole power of impeachment.Section 3.1. The senate of the United States shall be composed oftwo senators from each state, chosen by the legislature thereof,for six years ; and each senator shall have one vote.2. Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequenceof the first election, they shall be divided as equally as may beinto three classes. The seats of the senators of the first classshall be vacated at the expiration of the second year, of thesecond class, at the expiration of the fourth year, and of thethird class, at the expiration of the sixth year, so that one-thirdmay be chosen every second year ; and if vacancies happen byresignation, or otherwise, during the recess of the legislatureTHE CONSTITUTION. XIXof any state, the executive thereof may make temporary appointmentsuntil the next meeting of the legislature, whichshall then fill such vacancies.3. No person shall be a senator who shall not have attainedto the age of thirty years, and been nine years a citizen of theUnited States, and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitantof that state for which he shall be chosen.4. The vice-president of the United States shall he presidentof the senate, but shall have no vote, unless they beequally divided.5. The Senate shall choose their other officers, and also apresident pro tempore, in the absence of the vice-president, orwhen he shall exercise the office of president of the UnitedStates.6. The senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments.When sitting for that purpose, they shall be on oathor affirmation. When the president of the United States istried, the chief justice shall preside ; and no person shall beconvicted without the concurrence of two-thirds of the memberspresent.7. Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend furtherthan to removal from office, and disqualification to holdand enjoy any office of honour, trust, or profit, under the UnitedStates ; but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liableand subject to indictment, trial, judgment, and punishment, accordingto law.Section 4.1. The times, places, and manner of holding elections forsenators and representatives, shall be prescribed in each stateby the legislature thereof : but the congress may, at any timeby law, make or alter such regulations, except as to the placesof choosing senators.2. The congress shall assemble at least once in every year,and such meeting shall be on the first Monday in December,unless they shall by law appoint a different day.XX THE CONSTITUTION.Section 5.1. Each house shall be the judge of the elections, returns,and qualifications of its own members, and a majority of eachshall constitute a quorum to do business ; but a smaller numbermay adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to compelthe attendance of absent members, in such manner, andunder such penalties as each house may provide.2. Each house may determine the rules of its proceedings,punish its members for disorderly behaviour, and, with theconcurrence of two-thirds, expel a member.3. Each house shall keep a journal of its proceedings, andfrom time to time publish the same, excepting such parts asmay, in their judgment, require secrecy ; and the yeas andnays of the members of either house on any question, shall,at the desire of one-fifth of those present, be entered on thejournal.4. Neither house, during the session of congress, shall, withoutthe consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days,nor to any other place than that in which the two houses shallbe sitting. /Section 6.1. The senators and representatives shall receive a compensationfor their services, to be ascertained by law, and paidout of the treasury of the United States. They shall, in allcases, except treason, felony, and breach of the peace, be privilegedfrom arrest during their attendance at the session oftheir respective houses, and in going to, and returning from, thesame ; and for any speech or debate in either house, they shallnot be questioned In any other place.2. No senator or representative shall, during the time forwhich he was elected, be appointed to any civil office underthe authority of the United States, which shall have been created,or the emoluments whereof shall have been increasedduring such time ; and no person holding any office under theUnited States, shall be a member of either house during hiscontinuance In office.THE CONSTITUTION. XXIV Section 7.1. All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the houseof representatives ; but the senate may propose or concur withamendments as on other bills.2. Every bill which shall have passed the house of representativesand the senate, shall, before it become a law, be presentedto the president of the United States ; if he approve heshall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his objections, tothat house in which it shall have originated, who shall enterthe objections at large on their journal, and proceed to reconsiderit. If after such reconsideration two-thirds of that houseshall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, together with theobjections, to the other house, by which it shall likewise bereconsidered, and if approved by two-thirds of that house, itshall become a law. But in all such cases the votes of bothhouses shall be determined by yeas and nays, and the namesof the persons voting for and against the bill shall be enteredon the journal of each house respectively. If any bill shall notbe returned by the president within ten days, (Sundays excepted,)after it shall have been presented to him, the sameshall be a law, in like manner as if he had signed it, unlessthe congress by their adjournment prevent its return, in whichcase it shall not be a law.3. Every order, resolution, or vote, to which the concurrenceof the senate and house of representatives may be necessary,(except on a question of adjournment,) shall be presented tothe president of the United States ; and before the same shalltake effect, shall be approved by him. or being disapproved byhim, shall be re-passed by two-thirds of the senate and houseof representatives, according to the rules and limitations prescribedin the case of a bill.Section 8.The congress shall have power1.

To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever,over such district, (not exceeding ten miles square,) as may,by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of congress.THE CONSTITUTION. XXUlbecome the seat of the government of the United States, andto exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consentof the legislature of the state in which the same shall beforthe erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dock-yards, andother needful buildings : — And18. To make all laws which shall be necessary and properfor carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all otherpowers vested by this Constitution in the government of theUnited States, or in any department or officer thereof.Section 9.1. The migration or importation of such persons, as any ofthe states now existing shall think proper to admit, shall notbe prohibited by the congress prior to the year one thousandeight hundred and eight, but a tax or duty may be imposed onsuch importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each person.2. The privilege of the Writ of habeas corpus shall not besuspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion thepublic safety may require it.3. No bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed.4. No capitation, or other direct tax shall be laid, unless inproportion to the census or enumeration herein before directedto be taken.5.

No state shall, without theconsent of congress, lay any duty of tonnage, keep troops, orships of war, in time of peace, enter into any agreement orcompact with another state, or with a foreign power, or engagein war, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent danger aswill not admit of delay.ARTICLE II.Section 1.1. The executive power shall be vested in a president ofthe United States of America. He shall hold his office duringthe term of four years, and together with the vice-president,chosen for the same term, be elected as follows :2. Each state shall appoint, in such manner as the legislaturethereof may direct, a number of electors equal to the wholenumber of senators and representatives to which the state maybeentitled in the congress : but no senator or representative,or person holding an office of trust or profit under the UnitedStates, shall be appointed an elector.3. The electors shall meet in their respective states, andvote by ballot for two persons, of whom one at least shall notbe an inhabitant of the same state with themselves. Andthey shall make a list of all the persons voted for, and of thenumber of votes for each ; which list they shall sign and certify,THE CONSTITUTION. XXVand transmit, sealed, to the seat of the government of theUnited States, directed to the president of the senate. Thepresident of the senate shall, in the presence of the senate andhouse of representatives, open all the certificates, and the votesshall then be counted. The person having the greatest numberof votes shall be the president, if such number be a majorityof the whole number of electors appointed ; and if therebe more than one who have such majority, and have an equalnumber of votes, then the house of representatives shall immediatelychoose by ballot one of them for president ; andif no person have a majority, then, from the five highest onthe list the said house shall in like manner choose the president.But in choosing the president the votes shall be takenby states, the representation from each state having one vote ;a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or membersfrom two-thirds of the states, and a majority of all thestates shall be necessary to a choice. In every case, after thechoice of the president, the person having the greatest numberof votes of the electors shall be the vice-president. But ifthere should remain two or more who have equal votes, thesenate shall choose from them by ballot the vice-president.4. The congress may determine the time of choosing theelectors, and the day on which they shall give their votes ;which day shall be the same throughout the United States.5. No person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen ofthe United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution,shall be eligible to the office of president ; neither shallany person be eligible to that office who shall not have attainedto the age of thirty-five years, and been fourteen years a residentwithin the United States.6. In case of the removal of the president from office, or ofhis death,' resignation, or inability to discharge the powers andduties of the said office, the same shall devolve on the vice-president,and the congress may by law provide for the case ofremoval, death, resignation, or inability, both of the presidentand vice-president, declaring what officer shall then act as prester,DXXVI THE CONSTITUTION.indent, ?ind such officer shall act accordingly until the disabilitybe removed, or a president shall be elected.7. The president shall, at stated times, receive for his services,a compensation, which shall neither be increased nordiminished dining the period for which he shall have beenelected, and he shall not receive within that period any otheremolument from the United States or any of them.8. Before he enter on the execution of his office, he shalltake the following oath or affirmation :9. " I do solemnly swear, (or affirm,) that I will faithfullyexecute the office of president of the United States, and will,to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend theConstitution of the United States."Section 2.1. The president shall be commander-in-chief of the armyand navy of the United States, and of the militia ef the severalstates, when called into the actual service of the United States ;he may require the opinion, in writing, of the principal officerin each of the executive departments, upon any subject relatingto the duties of their respective offices, and he shall havepower to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against theUnited States, except in cases of impeachment.2.

States ofAmerica. In order to do this with clearness and accuracy,it is necessary to understand, what was the politicalposition of the several States, composing the Union,in relation to each other at the time of its adoption.This will naturally conduct us back to the AmericanRevolution ; and to the formation of the Confederationconsequent thereon. But if we stop here, we shall stillbe surrounded with many difficulties in regard to ourdomestic institutions and policy, which have grown outof transactions of a much earlier date, connected on oneside with the common dependence of all the Coloniesupon the British Empire, and on the other with the particularcharters of government and internal legislation,which belonged to each Colony, as a distinct sovereignty,and which have impressed upon each peculiarhabits, opinions, attachments, and even prejudices.Traces of these peculiarities are every where discerniblein the actual jurisprudence of each State ; andare silently or openly referred to in several of the pro-air.1Z CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.visions of the Constitution of the United States. Inshort, without a careful review of the origin and constitutionaland juridical history of all the colonies, of theprinciples common to all, and of the diversities, whichwere no less remarkable in all, it would be impossiblefully to understand the nature and objects of the Constitution;the reasons on which several of its most importantprovisions are founded ; and the necessity ofthose concessions and compromises, which a desire toform a solid and perpetual Union has incorporated intoits leading features.The plan of the work will, therefore, naturally comprehendthree great divisions. The first will embrace asketch of the charters, constitutional history, and ante-revolutionaryjurisprudence of the Colonies. The secondwill embrace a sketch of the constitutional historyof the States during the Revolution, and the rise,progress, decline, and fall of the Confederation. Thethird will embrace the history of the rise and adoptionof the Constitution ; and a full exposition of all its provisions,with the reasons, on which they were respectivelyfounded, the objections, by which they wererespectively assailed, and such illustrations drawn fromcontemporaneous documents, and the subsequent operationsof the government, as may best enable thereader to estimate for himself the true value of each.In this way (as it is hoped) his judgment as well as hisaffections will be enlisted on the side of the Constitution,as the truest security of the Union, and the onlysold basis, on which to rest the private rights, the publicliberties, and the substantial prosperity of the peoplecomposing the American Republic.BOOK I.HISTORY OF THE COLONIES.CHAPTER I.ORIGIN OF THE TITLE TO TERRITORY OF THECOLONIES.^ 1. The discovery of the Continent of America byColumbus in the fifteenth century awakened the attentionof all the maritime States of Europe. Stimulatedby the love of glory, and still more by the hope of gainand dominion, many of them early embarked in adventurousenterprises, the object of which was 'to foundcolonies, or to search for the precious metals, or to exchangethe products and manufactures of the old worldfor whatever was most valuable and attractive in thenew. England was not behind her continental neighboursin seeking her own aggrandizement, and nourishingher then infant commerce. The ambition ofHenry the Seventh was roused by the communicationsof Columbus, and in 1495 he granted a commission toJohn Cabot, an enterprising Venetian, then settled inEngland, to proceed on a voyage of discovery, and tosubdue and take possession of any lands unoccupiedby any Christian Power, in the name and for the benefitof the British Crown. In the succeeding yearCabot sailed on his voyage, and having first discovered4 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK I.the Islands of Newfoundland and St Johns, he afterwardssailed along the coast of the continent from the56th to the 38th degree of north latitude, and claimedfor his sovereign the vast region, which stretches fromthe Gulf of Mexico to the most northern regions.^ 2. Such is the origin of the British tide to the territorycomposing these United States. That tide wasfounded on the right of discovery, a right, which washeld among the European nations a just and sufficientfoundation, on which to rest their respective claims tothe American continent. Whatever controversies existedamong them, (and they were numerous,) respectingthe extent of their own acquisitions abroad, theyappealed to this as the ultimate fact, by which theirvarious and conflicting claims were to be adjusted. Itmay not be easy upon general reasoning to establishthe doctrine, that priority of discovery confers any exclusiveright to territory. It was probably adopted bythe European nations as a convenient and flexible rule,by which to regulate their respective claims. For itwas obvious, that in the mutual contests for dominionin newly discovered lands, there would soon arise violentand sanguinary struggles for exclusive possession,unless some common principle should be recognisedby all maritime nations for the benefit of all. Nonemore readily suggested itself than the one now underconsideration ; and as it was a principle of peace andrepose, of perfect equality of benefit in proportion tothe actual or supposed expenditures and hazards attendantupon such enterprises, it received a universalacquiescence, if not a ready approbation. It becamethe basis of European polity, and regulated the exerciseof the rights of sovereignty and settlement in allthe cis-atlantic Plantations. In respect to desert andCH. I.] ORIGIN AND TITLE TO TERRITORY. 5uninhabited lands, there does not seem any importantobjection, which can be urged against it. But in respectto countries, then inhabited by the natives, it isnot easy to perceive, how, in point of justice, or humanity,or general conformity to the law of nature, it can besuccessfully vindicated. As a conventional rule it mightproperly govern all the nations, which recognised itsobligation ; but it could have no authority over the aboriginesof America, whether gathered into civilizedcommunities, or scattered in hunting tribes over thewilderness. Their right, whatever it was, of occupationor use, stood upon original principles deduciblefrom the law of nature, and could not be justly narrowedor extinguished without their own free consent.§ 3. There is no doubt, that the Indian tribes, inhabitingthis continent at the time of its discovery, maintaineda claim to the exclusive possession and occupancyof the territory within their respective limits, assovereigns and absolute proprietors of the soil. Theyacknowledged no obedience, or allegiance, or subordinationto any foreign sovereign whatsoever ; and as faras they have possessed the means, they have ever sinceasserted this plenary right of dominion, and yielded itup only when lost by the superior force of conquest, ortransferred by a voluntary cession.^ 4. The European nations found little difficulty inreconciling themselves to the adoption of any principle,which gave ample scope to their ambition, and employedlittle reasoning to support it. They were contentto take counsel of their interests, their prejudices, andtheir passions, and felt no necessity of vindicating theirconduct before cabinets, which were already eager torecognise its justice and its policy. The Indians werea savage race, sunk in the depths of ignorance and6 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK I.heathenism. If they might not be extirpated for theirwant of religion and just morals, they might be reclaimedfrom their errors. They were bound to yield to thesuperior genius of Europe, and in exchanging theirwild and debasing habits, for civilization and Christianitythey were deemed to gain more than an equivalentfor every sacrifice and suffering. The Papal authority,too, was brought in aid of these great designs ; and forthe purpose of overthrowing heathenism, and propagatingthe Catholic religion, Alexander the Sixth, by aBull issued in 1493, granted to the crown of Castile thewhole of the immense territory then discovered, or tobe discovered, between the poles, so far as it was notthen possessed by any Christian prince.^ 5. The principle, then, that discovery gave titleto the government, by whose subjects or by whose authorityit was made, against all other European governments,being once established, it followed almost as amatter of course, that every government within the limitsof its discoveries excluded all other persons fromany right to acquire the soil, by any grant whatsoever,from the natives. No nation would suffer, either itsown subjects, or those of any other nation, to set up orvindicate any such title. It was deemed a right, exclusivelybelonging to the government, in its sovereign capacityto extinguish the Indian title, and to perfect itsown dominion over the soil, and dispose of it accordingto its own good pleasure.^ 6. It may be asked, what was the effect of thisprinciple of discovery in respect to the rights of the nativesthemselves. In the view of the Europeans it createda peculiar relation between themselves and theaboriginal inhabitants. The latter were admitted topossess a present right of occupancy, or use in the soil.CH. I.] ORIGIN AND TITLE TO TERRITORY. 7which was subordinate to the ultimate dominion of thediscoverer. They were admitted to be the rightfuloccupants of the soil, with a legal, as well as just claimto retain possession of it, and to use it according totheir own discretion. In a certain sense, they werepermitted to exercise rights of sovereignty over it.They might sell or transfer it to the sovereign, who discoveredit ; but they were denied the authority to disposeof it to any other persons ; and until such a saleor transfer, they were generally permitted to occupy itas sovereigns de facto. But, notwithstanding thisoccupancy, the European discoverers claimed andexercised the right to grant the soil, while yet inpossession of the natives, subject however to theirright of occupancy ; and the title so granted was universallyadmitted to convey a sufficient title in the soilto the grantees in perfect dominion, or, as it is. sometimesexpressed in treatises of public law, it was atransfer of plenum et utile dominium.8 ORIGIN AND SETTLEMENT OF VIRGINIA. [BOOK I.CHAPTER 11.ORIGIN AND SETTLEMENT OF VIRGINIA.^ 7. Having thus traced out the origin of the titleto the soil of America asserted by the European nations,we may now enter upon a consideration of themanner in which the settlements were made, and thepolitical constitutions, by which the various Colonieswere organized and governed.§ 8. The first permanent settlement made in America,under the auspices of England, was under a chartergranted to Sir Thomas Gates and his associates byJames the First, in the fourth year after his accession tothe throne of England (in 1606.) That charter grantedto them the territories in America, then commonlycalled Virginia, lying on the sea-coast between the 34thand the 45th degrees of north latitude and the islandsadjacent within 100 miles, which were not belongingto, or possessed by any Christian prince or people.The associates were divided into two companies, oneof which was required to setde between the 34th and41st degrees of north latitude, and the other betweenthe 38th and 45th degrees of north latitude, but notwithin 100 miles of the prior colony. By degrees, thename of Virginia was confined to the first or south colony.The second assumed the name of the PlymouthCompany, from the residence of the original grantees ;and New-england was founded under their auspices.Each colony had exclusive propriety in all the territorywithin fifty miles from the first seat of their plantation.^ 9. The charter of the first or Virginia colony wassuccessively altered in 1609 and 1612, without anyCH. II.} Orig AND SETTLEMENT OP vri^GmiA. 9important change in its substantial provisions, as to thecivil or political rights of the colonists. It is surprising,indeed, that charters, securing such vast powers to thecrown, and such entire dependence on the part of theemigrants, should have found any favour in the eyeseither of the proprietors, or of the people. By placingthe whole legislative and executive powers in a councilnominated by the crown, and guided by its instructions,every person settling in America seems to have beenbereaved of the noblest privileges of a free man. Butwithout hesitation or reluctance, the proprietors ofboth colonies prepared to execute their respectiveplans ; and under the authority of a charter, whichwould now be rejected with disdain, as a violent invasionof the sacred and inalienable rights of liberty, thefirst permanent settlements of the English in America-wereestablished. From this period the progress ofthe two provinces of Virginia and New-england form aregular and connected story. The former in the South,and the latter in the North, may be considered as theoriginal and parent colonies, in imitation of which, andunder whose shelter, all the others have been successivelyplanted and reared.^ 10. The settlements in Virginia were earliest iiipoint of date, and were fast advancing under a policy,which subdivided the property among the settlers, insteadof retaining it in common, and thus gave vigourto private enterprise. As the colony increased, the spiritof its members assumed more and more the tone ofindependence; and they grew restless and impatient forthe privileges enjoyed under the government of theirnative country. To quiet this uneasiness. Sir GeorgeYearly, then the governor of the colony, in 1619,called a general assembly, composed of represented.210 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK I*lives from the various plantations in the colony, andpermitted them to assume and exercise the high functionsof legislation. Thus was formed and establishedthe first representative legislature, that ever sat inAmerica. The conduct of the colonists, as v^ell asthe company, soon afterwards gave offence to KingJames ; and the disasters, which accomplished an almosttotal destruction of the colony by the successfulinroads of the Indians, created much discontent anddisappointment among the proprietors at home. Theking found it no difficult matter to satisfy the nation,that an inquiry into their conduct was necessary. Itwas accordingly ordered ; and the result of that inquiry,by commissioners appointed by himself, was ademand, on the part of the crown, of a surrender ofthe charters. The demand was resisted by the company;a quo warranto was instituted against them,and it terminated, as in that age it might well be supposedit would, in a judgment, pronounced in 1624by judges holding their offices during his pleasure,that the franchises were forfeited and the corporationshould be dissolved.§ 11. With the fall of the charter the colony cameunder the immediate government and control of thecrown itself; and the king issued a special commissionappointing a governor and twelve counsellors, to whomthe entire direction of its affairs was committed. Inthis commission no representative assembly was mentioned; and there is little reason to suppose that James,who, besides his arbitrary notions of government, imputedthe recent disasters to the existence of such anassembly, ever intended to revive it. While he wasyet meditating upon a plan or code of government, hisdeath put an end to his projects, which where betterCH. II.] ORIGIN AND SETTLEMENT OF VIRGINIA. 11calculated to nourish his own pride and conceit, thanto subserve the permanent interests of the province.Henceforth, however, Virginia continued to be a royalprovince until the period of the American Revolution.^12. Charles the First adopted the notions and followedout, in its full extent, the colonial system of hisfather. He declared the colony to be a part of theempire annexed to the crown, and immediately subordinateto its jurisdiction. During the greater part of hisreign, Virginia knew no other law, than the will of thesovereign, or his delegated agents ; and statutes werepassed and taxes imposed without the slightest effortto convene a colonial assembly. It was not until themurmurs and complaints, which such a course of conductwas calculated to produce, had betrayed the inhabitantsinto acts of open resistance to the governor,and into a firm demand of redress from the crownagainst his oppressions, that the king was brought tomore considerate measures. He did not at once yieldto their discontents ; but pressed, as he was, by severeembarrassments at home, he was content to adopt apolicy, which would conciliate the colony and removesome of its just complaints. He accordingly, soon afterwards,appointed Sir William Berkeley governor,with powers and instructions, which breathed a far morebenign spirit. He was authorized to proclaim, that inall its concerns, civil as w^ell as ecclesiastical, the colonyshould be governed according to the laws of England.He was directed to issue writs for electing representativesof the people, who with the governor and councilshould form a general assembly, clothed with supremelegislative authority ; and to establish courts of justice,whose proceedings should be guided by the forms ofthe parent country. The rights of Englishmen were.i2 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK I.thus, in a great measure, secured to the colonists ; andunder the government of this excellent magistrate, withsome short intervals of interruption, the colony flourishedwith a vigorous growth for almost forty years. Therevolution of 1688 found it, if not in the practical possessionof liberty, at least with forms of government^'ell calculated silently to cherish its spirit.CH. III.] SETTLEMENT OF New-england. 13CHAPTER III.ORIGIN AND SETTLEMENT OF New-england.§ 13. We may now advert in a brief manner to thehistory of the Northern, or Plymouth Company. Thatcompany possessed fewer resources and less enterprisethan the Southern ; and though aided by men of highdistinction, its first efforts for colonization were feebleand discouraging. Capt. John Smith, so well knownin the History of Virginia by his successful adventuresunder their authority, lent a transient lustre to their attempts; and his warm descriptions of the beauty andfertility of the country procured for it from the excitedimagination of the Prince, after King Charles the First,the flattering name of JYew- England, a name, whicheffaced from it that of Virginia, and which has sincebecome dear beyond expression, to the inhabitants ofits harsh but salubrious climate.§ 14. While the company was yet languishing, anevent occurred, which gave a new and unexpectedaspect to its prospects. It is well known, that the religiousdissensions consequent upon the reformation, whilethey led to a more bold and free spirit of discussion,failed at the same time of introducing a correspondentcharity for differences of religious opinion. Each successivesect entertained not the slightest doubt of itsown infallibility in doctrine and worship, and was eagerto obtain proselytes, and denounce the errors of itsopponents. If it had stopped here, we might have forgotten,in admiration of the sincere zeal for Christian truth,the desire of power, and the pride of mind, which lurkedwithin the inner folds of their devotion. But unfor-14 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK I.tunately the spirit of intolerance was abroad in all itsstern and unrelenting severity. To tolerate errors wasto sacrifice Christianity to mere temporal interests.Truth, and truth alone, was to be followed at the hazardof all consequences; and religion allowed no compromisesbetween conscience and worldly comforts.Heresy was itself a sin of a deadly nature, and to extirpateit was a primary duty of all, who were believers insincerityand truth. Persecution, therefore, even when itseemed most to violate the feelings of humanity andthe rights of private judgment, never wanted apologistsamong those of the purest and most devout lives. Itwas too often received with acclamations by the crowd,and found an ample vindication from the learned andthe dogmatists; from the policy of the civil magistrate,'and the blind zeal of the ecclesiastic. Each sect, as itattained power, exhibited the same unrelenting firmnessin putting down its adversaries. The papist and theprelate, the puritan and the presbyterian, felt no compunctionsin the destruction of dissentients from theirown faith. They uttered, indeed, loud complaints ofthe injustice of their enemies, when they were themselvesoppressed; but it was not from any abhorrence ofpersecution itself, but of the infamous errors of the persecutors.There are not wanting on the records of thehistory of these times abundant proofs, how easily sects,which had borne every human calamity with shrinkingfortitude for conscience' sake, could turn upontheir inoffensive, but, in their judgment, erring neighbours,with a like infliction of suffering. Even adversitysometimes fails of producing its usual salutaryeffects of moderation and compassion, when a blind buthonest zeal has usurped dominion over the mind. Ifsuch a picture of human infirmity may justly add to ourCH. III.] SETTLEMENT OF New-england. 15humility, it may also serve to admonish us of the Christianduty of forbearance. And he, who can look with aneye of exclusive censure on such scenes, must have forgotten,how many bright examples they have affordedof the liveliest virtue, the most persuasive fidelity, andthe most exalted piety.^15. Among others, who suffered persecutions fromthe haughty zeal of Elizabeth, was a small sect, called,from the name of their leader, Brownish, to whom weowe the foundation of the now wide spread sect of Congregationalistsor Independents. After sufferings of anaggravated nature, they were compelled to take refuge inHolland under the care of their pastor, Mr. John Robinson,a man distinguished for his piety, his benevolence,and his intrepid spirit. After remaining theresome years, they concluded to emigrate to America inthe hope, that they might thus perpetuate their religiousdiscipline, and preserve the purity of an apostolicalchurch. In conjunction with other friends in Englandthey embarked on the voyage with a design of settlementon Hudson's river in New-york. But againsttheir intention they were compelled to land on theshores of Gape Cod in the depth of winter, and theplace of their landing was called Plymouth, which hassince become so celebrated as the first permanent setdementin New-england. Not having contemplatedany plantation at this place, they had not taken the precautionto obtain any charter from the Plymouth Company.^16. On the 11th of November, 1620, these humblebut fearless adventurers, before their landing, drewup and signed an original compact, in which, afteracknowledging themselves subjects of the crown ofEngland, they proceed to declare: " Having undertaken.16 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK J.for the glory of God and the advancement of the Christianfaith and the honor of our king and country, avoyage to plant the first colony in the northern parts ofVirginia, we do by these presents solemnly and mutually,in the presence of God and of one another, covenantand combine ourselves together into a civil body politic,for our better ordering and preservation and furtheranceof the ends aforesaid. And by virtue hereof do enact,constitute, and frame such just and equal laws, ordinances,acts, constitutions, and officers from time to time, asshall be thought most meet and convenient for the generalgood of the colony ; unto which we promise alldue submission and obedience." This is the wholeof the compact, and it was signed by forty-one persons.It is in its very essence a pure democracy ;and in pursuance of it the colonists proceeded soonafterwards to organize the colonial government, underthe name of the Colony of New Plymouth, toappoint a governor and other officers, and to enactlaws. The governor was chosen annually by thefreemen, and had at first one assistant to aid him inthe discharge of his trust. Four others were soonafterwards added, and finally the number was increasedto seven. The supreme legislative powerresided in, and was exercised by the whole body ofthe male inhabitants, every freeman, who was a memberof the church, being admitted to vote in all publicaffairs. The number of settlements having increased,and being at a considerable distance from each other,a house of representatives was established in 1639;the members of which, as well as all other officers, wereannually chosen. They adopted the common law ofEngland, as the general basis of their jurisprudence, varyingit however from time to time by municipal regu-CH. ni.] SETTLEMENT OF New-england. 17nations better adapted to their situation, or conformingmore exactly to their stern notions of the absolute authorityand universal obligation of the Mosaic Institutions.^ 17. The Plymouth Colonists acted, at first, altogetherunder the voluntary compact and associationalready mentioned. But they daily felt embarrassmentsfrom the want of some general authority, derived directlyor indirectly from the crown, which should recognisetheir settlement and confirm their legislation. Afterseveral ineffectual attempts made for this purpose, theyat length succeeded in obtaining, in January, 1629, apatent from the council established at Plymouth, inEngland, under the charter of King James of 1620.^18. This patent or charter seems never to have beenconfirmed by the crown ; and the colonists were never,by any act of the crown, created a body politic andcorporate with any legislative powers. They, therefore,remained in legal contemplation a mere voluntaryassociation, exercising the highest powers and prerogativesof sovereignty, and yielding obedience to the lawsand magistrates chosen by themselves.^19. The charter of 1629 furnished them, however,with the colour of delegated sovereignty, of whichthey did not fail to avail themselves. They assumedunder it the exercise of the most plenary executive,legislative, and judicial powers with but a momentaryscruple, as to their right to inflict capital punishments.They were not disturbed in the free exercise of thesepowers, either through the ignorance or the connivanceof the crown, until after the restoration of Charles theSecond. Their authority under their charter was thenquestioned ; and several unsuccessful attempts weremade to procure a confirmation from the crown. TheyAbr. 318 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK I.continued to cling to it, until, in the general shipwreckof charters in 1684, theirs was overturned. An arbitrarygovernment was then established over them incommon with the other New-england colonies ; andthey were finally incorporated into a province withMassachusetts under the charter granted to the latterby William and Mary in 1691.CH. IV.] Massachusetts. 19CHAPTER IV.MASSACHUSETTS.^ 20. About the period when the Plymouth colonistscompleted their voyage, James the First, with aview to promote more effectually the interests of thesecond or northern company, granted to the Duke ofLennox and others of the company a new charter, bywhich its territories were extended in breadth from the40th to the 48th degree of north latitude ; and in lengthby all the breadth aforesaid throughout the main landfrom sea to sea, excluding however all possession ofany other Christian prince, and all lands within thebounds of the southern colony. To the territory thusbounded he affixed the name of New-england, and tothe corporation itself so created, the name of "TheCouncil established at Plymouth in the county ofDevon, for the planting, ruling, ordering, and governingof New-england in America."§ 21. Some of the powers granted by this charterwere alarming to many persons, and especially those,which granted a monopoly of trade. The efforts tosetde a colony within the territory were again renewed,and again were unsuccessful. The spirit of religion,however, soon effected, what the spirit of commerce hadfailed to accomplish. The Puritans, persecuted athome, and groaning under the weight of spiritual bondage,cast a longing eye towards America, as an ultimateretreat for themselves and their children. Theywere encouraged by the information, that the colonistsat Plymouth were allowed to worship their Creatoraccording to the dictates of their consciences, without20 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK I,molestation. They opened a negotiation, through theinstrumentality of a Mr. White, a distinguished nonconformingminister, with the council established atPlymouth ; and in March, 1627, procured from them agrant to Sir Henry Boswell and others of all that partof New-england lying three miles south of Charlesriver and three miles north of Merrimack river, and extendingfrom the Atlantic to the South Sea:§ 22. Other persons were soon induced to unitewith them, if a charter could be procured from thecrown, which should secure to the adventurers the usualpowers of government. Application was made for thispurpose to King Charles, who, accordingly, in March1628, granted to the grantees and their associates themost ample powers of government. The charter confirmedto them the territory already granted by the councilestablished at Plymouth, to be holden of the crown,as of the royal manor of East Greenwich, "in free andcommon soccage, and not in capite, nor by knight's service,"yielding to the crown one fifth part of all ore ofgold and silver, &c, with the exception, however, of anypart of the territory actually possessed or inhabited byany other Christian prince or state, or of any part of itwithin the bounds of the southern colony [of Virginia]granted by King James. It also created the associatesa body politic by the name of " The Governor andCompany of the Massachusetts Bay in New-england,"with the usual powers of corporations. It provided,that the government should be administered by a governor,a deputy governor, and eighteen assistants, fromtime to time elected out of the freemen of the company,which officers should have the care of the generalbusiness and affairs of the lands and plantations, and thegovernment of the people there ; and it appointed theCH. IV.] MASSACHUSETTS. 21first governor, deputy governor, and assistants by name.It further provided, that a court or quorum for thetransaction of business should consist of the governor, orthe deputy governor, and seven or more assistants, whichshould assemble as often as once a month for that purpose,and also, that four great general assemblies of thecompany should be held in every year. In these greatand general assemblies, (which were composed of thegovernor, deputy, assistants, and freemen present,) freemenwere to be admitted free of the company, officerswhere to be elected, and laws and ordinances for the goodand welfare of the colony made ; " so as such laws andordinances be not contrary or repugnant to the lawsand statutes of this our realm of England." At one ofthese great and general assemblies held in Easter Term,the governor, deputy, and assistants, and other officerswere to be annually chosen by the company present.The company were further authorized to transport anysubjects or strangers willing to become subjects of thecrown to the colony, and to carry on trade to and fromit, without custom or subsidy for seven years, andwere to be free of all taxation of imports or exports toand from the English dominion for the space of tw anyoneyears, with the exception of a five per cent. duty.The charter further provided, that all subjects of thecrown, who should become inhabitants, and their childrenborn there, or on the seas going or returning,should enjoy all liberties and immunities of free and naturalsubjects, as if they and every of them where bornwithin the realm of England. Full legislative authoritywas also given, subject to the restriction of not beingcontrary to the laws of England, as also for the impositionof fines and mulcts " according to the course ofother corporations in England." Many other provisoHISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [BOOK I.ions were added, similar in substance to those found inthe antecedent colonial charters of the crown.§ 23. Such were the original limits of the colony ofMassachusetts Bay, and such were the powers and privilegesconferred on it. It is observable, that the wholestructure of the charter presupposes the residence ofthe company in England, and the transaction of all itsbusiness there. The experience of the past had notsufficiently instructed the adventurers, that settlementsin America could not be well governed by corporationsresident abroad ; or if any of them had arrived at sucha conclusion, there were many reasons for presuming,that the crown would be jealous of granting powers ofso large a nature, which were to be exercised at sucha distance, as would render any control or responsibilityover them wholly visionary.^ 24. But a bolder step was soon afterwards takenby the company itself. It was ascertained, that Hidesuccess would attend the plantation, so long as its affairswere under the control of a distant government,knowing little of its wants and insensible to its difficulties.Many persons, indeed, possessed of fortune andcharacter, warmed with religious zeal, or suffering underreligious intolerance, were ready to embark in theenterprise, if the corporation should be removed, so thatthe powers of government might be exercised by theactual setters. The company had already becomealarmed at the extent of their own expenditures, andthere were but faint hopes of any speedy reimbursement.They entertained some doubts of the legality of thecourse of transferring the charter. But at length it wasdetermined in August, 1629, "by the general consentof the company, that the government and patent shouldbe settled in New-england." This resolution infusedCH. IV.] MASSACHUSETTS. 23new life into the association ; and the next election olofficers was made from among those proprietors, whohad signified an intention to remove to America. Thegovernment and charter were accordingly removed;and henceforth the whole management of all the affairsof the colony was confided to persons and magistratesresident within its own bosom. The fate of the colonywas thus decided; and it grew with a rapidity andstrength, that soon gave it a great ascendancy among theNew-england settlements, and awakened the jealousy,distrust, and vigilance of the parent country.^ 25. The government of the colony immediately afterthe removal of the charter was changed in many importantfeatures ; but its fundamental grants of territory,powers, and privileges were eagerly maintained in theiroriginal validity. It is true, as Dr. Robertson has observed,that as soon as the Massachusetts emigrantshad landed on these shores, they considered themselvesfor many purposes as a voluntary association, possessingthe natural rights of men to adopt that mode of government,which was most agreeable to themselves, andto enact such laws, as were conducive to their own welfare.They did not, indeed, surrender up their charter,or cease to recognise its obligatory force. But theyextended their acts far beyond its expression of powers; and while they boldly claimed protection from itagainst the royal demands and prerogatives, they neverthelessdid not feel, that it furnished any limit uponthe freest exercise of legislative, executive, or judicialfunctions. They did not view it, as creating an Englishcorporation under the narrow construction of the commonlaw; but as affording the means of founding a broadpolitical government, subject to the crown of England,but yet enjoying many exclusive privileges.24 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK I.§ 26, It may be well to state in this connexion, thatthe council established at Plymouth in a very short periodafter the grant of the Massachusetts charter (in1 635) finally surrendered their own patent back to thecrown. They had made other grants of territory, whichwe shall hereafter have occasion to notice, which hadgreatly diminished the value, as well as importance oftheir charter. But the immediate cause of the surrenderwas the odious extent of the monopolies grantedto them, which roused the attention of Parliament, andof the nation at large, and compelled them to resign,what they could scarcely maintain against the strongcurrent of public opinion. The surrender, so far fromworking any evil, rather infused new life into the colonies,which sprung from it, by freeing them from allrestraint and supervision by a superior power, to whichthey might perhaps have been held accountable. Immediatelyafter this surrender legal proceedings wereinstituted against the proprietors of the Massachusettscharter. Those who appeared were deprived of theirfranchises. But fortunately the measure was not carriedinto complete execution against the absent proprietorsacting under the charter in America.^ 27. After the fall of the first colonial charter in1684, Massachusetts remained for some years in a verydisturbed state under the arbitrary power of the crown.At length a new chatter was in 1691 granted to thecolony by William and Mary; and it henceforth becameknown as a province, and continued to act under this lastcharter until after the Revolution. The charter comprehendedwithin its territorial limits all the old colony ofthe Massachusetts Bay, the colony of New-Plymouth,the Province of Maine, the territory called Acadia,or Nova Scotia, and all the lands lying between NovaCH. IV.] MASSACHUSETTS. 25Scotia and Maine; and incorporated the whole into oneProvince by the name of the Province of the MassachusettsBay in New-england, to be holden as of the royalmanor of East Greenwich, in the county of Kent. Itconfirmed all prior grants made of lands to all persons,corporations, colleges, towns, villages, and schools. Itreserved to the crown the appointment of the Governor,and Lieut. Governor, and Secretary of the province,and all the officers of the Court of Admiralty. It providedfor the appointment annually of twenty-eight Counsellors,who were to be chosen by the General Court,and nominated the first board. The Governor andCounsellors were to hold a council for the ordering anddirecting of the affairs of the Province. The Governorwas invested with the right of nominating and with theadvice of the council of appointing all military officers,and all sheriffs, provosts, marshals, and justices of thepeace, and other officers of courts of justice. He hadalso the power of calling the General Court, and of adjourning,proroguing, and dissolving it. He had also anegative upon all laws passed by the General Court.The General Court was to assemble annually on thelast Wednesday of May, and was to consist of the Governorand Council for the time being, and of such representativesbeing freeholders, as should be annuallyelected by the freeholders in each town, who possesseda freehold of forty shillings annual value, or other estateto the value of forty pounds. Each town was enticedto two representatives ; but the General Court wasfrom time to time to,^ decide on the number, which eachtown should send. The General Court was investedwith full authority to erect courts, to levy taxes, andmake all wholesome laws and ordinances, " so ^sthe same be not repugnant or contrary to the laws ofAbr. 4 ''26 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [BOOK I.England;" and to settle annually all civil officers,whose appointment was not otherwise provided for.All laws, however, were to be sent to England forapprobation or disallowance ; and if disallowed, and sosignified under the sign manual and signet, within threeyears, the same thenceforth to cease and become void ;otherwise to continue in force according to the termsof their original enactment. The General Court wasalso invested with authority to grant any lands in thecolonies of Massachusetts, New Plymouth, and Provinceof Maine, with certain exceptions. The Governorand Council were invested with full jurisdiction asto the probate of wills and granting administrations. TheGovernor was also made commander-in-chief of themiHtia, with the usual martial powers ; but was not toexercise martial law without the advice of the Council.In case of his death, removal, or absence, his authoritywas to devolve on the Lieut. Governor, or, if his officewas vacant, then on the Council. With a view also toadvance the growth of the Province by encouragingnew settlements, it was expressly provided, that thereshould be "a liberty of conscience allowed in the worshipof God to all Christians, except Papists ;" andthat all subjects inhabiting in the Province and theirchildren born therefor on the seas going or returning,should have all the liberties and immunities of free andnatural subjects, as if they were born within the realmof England. And in all cases an appeal was allowedfrom the judgments of any courts of the Province to theKing in the Privy Council in England, where the matterin difference exceeded three hundred pounds sterling.And finally there was a reservation of the wholeadmiralty jurisdiction to the crown ; and of a right toall subjects to fish on the coasts. Considering theCH. IV.] MASSACHUSETTS. 27spirit of the times, it must be acknowledged, that, on thewhole, this charter contains a liberal grant of authorityto the Province ; and a reasonable reservation of theroyal prerogative. It was hailed with sincere satisfactionby the colony after the dangers, which had for solong a time menaced its liberties and its peace.28 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK I.CHAPTER V.New-hampshire.^ 28. Having gone into a full consideration of theorigin and political organization of the primitive coloniesin the South and North, it remains only to take a rapidview of those, which were subsequently established inboth regions. An historical order will probably; befound as convenient for this purpose, as any, whichcould be devised.^ 29. In November, 1629, Capt. John Mas on. ob tainteda grant from the council of Plymouth of all that partof the main land in New-england "lying upon the seacoast,beginning from the middle part of Merrimack river,and from thence to proceed northwards alcftig thesea-coast to Piscataqua river, and so forwards yp withinthe said river and to the furthest head thereof; andfrom thence northwestern until three score miles befinished from the first entrance of Piscataqua river ; andalso from Merrimack through the said river ai^jd to thefurthest head thereof, and so forwards up antoine landswestwards, until three score miles be finished ;,»|feind fromthence to cross over land to the three score .inches andaccounted from Piscataqua river, together ' with allislands and islets within five leagues distance of thepremises." This territory was afterwards called New-hampshire.The land so granted was expressly subjectedto the conditions and limitations in the originalpatent ; and there was a covenant on the part of Masonthat he would establish such government therein, andcontinue the same, " as shall be agreeable, as near asmay be, to the laws and customs of the realm of Enoch.v.] New-hampshire. 29land." A further grant was made to Mason by thecouncil of Plymouth about the time of the surrenderof their charter, (22 April, 1635,) "beginning fromthe middle part of Naumkeag river [Salem], and fromthence to proceed eastwards along the sea-coast toCape Ann and round about the same to Piscataquaharbor; and then covering much of the land in theprior grant, and giving to the whole the name of New-hampshire."This grant included a power of judicaturein all cases, civil and criminal, " to be exercisedand executed according to the laws of England asnear as may be," reserving an appeal to the council.No patent of confirmation of this grant appears to havebeen made by the crown after the surrender of the Plymouthpatent.§ 30. Various detached settlements were madewithin this territory ; and so ill defined were the boundaries,that a controversy soon arose between Massachusettsand Mason in respect to the right of sovereigntyover it. In the exposition of its own charter Massachusettscontended, that its limits included the wholeterritory of New-hampshire ; and being at that timecomparatively strong and active, she succeeded inestablishing her jurisdiction over it, and maintained itwith unabated vigilance for forty years. The controversywas finally brought before the king in council ;and in 1 679 it was solemnly adjudged against the claimof Massachusetts. And it being admitted, that Mason,under his grant, had no right to exercise any powers ofgovernment, a commission was, in the same year, issuedby the crown for the government of New-hampshire.By the form of government, described in this commission,the whole executive power was vested in a presidentand council appointed by the crown, to whom also30 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK I.was confided the judiciary power with an appeal toEngland. In the administration of justice it was directed,that "the form of proceedings in such cases, andthe judgment thereon to be given, be as consonant andagreeable to the laws and statutes of this our realm ofEngland, as the present state and condition of our subjectsinhabiting within the limits aforesaid, and the circumstancesof the place will admit." The legislativepower was entrusted to the president, council, and burgesses,or representatives • chosen by the towns ; andthey were authorized to levy taxes and to make lawsfor the interest of the province; which laws beingapproved by the president and council were to standand be in force, until the pleasure of the king shouldbe known, whether the same laws and ordinancesshould receive any change or confirmation, or be totallydisallowed and discharged. And the presidentand council were required to transmit and send overthe same by the first ship, that should depart thence forEngland after their making. Liberty of conscience wasallowed to all protestants, those of the Church of Englandto be particularly encouraged. And a pledge wasgiven in the commission to continue the privilege of anassembly in the same manner and form, unless byinconvenience arising therefrom the crown should seecause to alter the same.CH. VI.] MAINE. 31CHAPTER VLMAINE.§ 31. In August, 1622, the council of Plymouth(which seems to have been extremely profuse andinconsiderate in its grants) granted to Sir FerdinandoGorges and Capt. John Mason all the lands lying betweenthe rivers Merrimack and Sagadahock, extendingback to the great lakes and rivers of Canada ; whichwas called Laconia. In April, 1639, Sir Ferdinandoobtained from the crown a confirmatory grant of all theland from Piscataqua to Sagadahock and the Kennelriver, and from the coast into the northern interiorone hundred and twenty miles; and it was styled "TheProvince of Maine." Of this province he was madeLord Palatine, with all the powers, jurisdiction, androyalties belonging to the bishop of the county Palatineof Durham ; and the lands were to be holden, as of themanor of East Greenwich. The charter contains areservation of faith and allegiance to the crown, as havingthe supreme dominion ; and the will and pleasure ofthe crown is signified, that the religion of the Church ofEngland be professed, and its ecclesiastical governmentestablished in the province. It also authorizes thePalatine, with the assent of the greater part of the freeholdersof the province, to make laws not repugnant orcontrary, but as near as conveniently may be to the lawsof England, for the public good of the province; and toerect courts of judicature for the determination of allcivil and criminal causes, with an appeal to the Palatine.But all the powers of government, so granted, were to32 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK I.be subordinate to the "power and regement,''^ of thelords commissioners for foreign plantations for the timebeing. The Palatine also had authority to make ordinancesfor the government of the province, under certainrestrictions; and a grant of full admiralty powers, subjectto that of the Lord High Admiral of England. Andthe inhabitants, being subjects of the crown, were toenjoy all the rights and privileges of natural born subjectsin England.^ 32. Under these ample provisions Gorges soonestablished a civil government in the province, andmade ordinances. The government, such as it was,was solely confided to the executive, without any powersof legislation. The province languished in imbecilityunder his care ; and began to acquire vigour onlywhen he ceased to act as proprietary and lawgiver.Massachusetts soon afterwards set up an exclusive rightand jurisdiction over the territory, as within its charteredlimits ; and was able to enforce obedience andsubmission to its power. It continued under the jurisdictionof Massachusetts until 1665, when the commissionersof the crown separated it for a short period ;but the authority of Massachusetts was soon afterwardsre-established. The controversy between Massachusettsand the Palatine, as to jurisdiction over the province,was brought before the privy council at the sametime with that of Mason respecting New-hampshire,and the claim of Massachusetts was adjudged void.Before a final adjudication was had, Massachusetts hadthe prudence and sagacity, in 1677, to purchase thethe of Gorges for a trifling sum ; and thus to the greatdisappointment of the crown, (then in treaty for thesame object,) succeeded to it, and held it, and governor.VI.] MAINE. 33ed it as a provincial dependency, until the fall of its owncharter; and it afterwards, as we have seen, was incorporatedwith Massachusetts in the provincial charter of1691.Abr,34 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK I,CHAPTER VII.CONNECTICUT.§ 33. Connecticut was originally settled underthe protection of Massachusetts; but the inhabitants inafew years afterwards (1638) felt at liberty (after theexample of Massachusetts) to frame a constitution ofgovernment and laws for themselves. In 1630 theEarl of Warwick obtained from the council of Plymoutha patent of the land upon a straight line near the seashoretowards the southwest, west and by south, orwest from Narraganset river forty leagues, as the coastlies towards Virginia, and all within that breadth to theSouth sea. In March, 1 63 1 , the Earl of Warwick conveyedthe same to Lord Say and Scale and others.In April, 1 635, the same council granted the same territoryto the Marquis of Hamilton. Possession underthe tide of Lord Say and Scale and others was takenof the mouth of the Connecticut in 1635. The settlersthere where not, however, disturbed ; and finally, in1644, they extinguished the title of the proprietaries, orLords, and continued to act under the constitution ofgovernment, which they had framed in 1638.§ 34. The colony of New-Haven had a separate origin,and was settled by emigrants immediately fromEngland, without any tide derived from the patentees.They began their settlement in 1638, purchasing theirlands of the natives; and entered into a solemn compactof government.^ 35. Soon after the restoration of Charles the Secondto the throne, the colony of Connecticut, aware ofthe doubtful nature of its title to the exercise of sove-CH. VII.] CONNECTICUT. 35reign, solicited and in April, 1662, obtained fromthat monarch a charter of government and territory.The charter included within its Ihnits the whole colonyof JNTew-haven; and as this was done without the consentof the latter, resistance was made to the incorporation,until 1665, when both were indissolubly united,and have ever since remained under one general government.§ 36. The charter of Connecticut, which has beenobjected to by Chalmers, as establishing "a meredemocracy, or rule of the people," contained, indeed, avery ample grant of privileges. It incorporated theinhabitants by the name of the Governor and Companyof the Colony of Connecticut in New-england, in America.It ordained, that two general assemblies shall beannually held ; and that the assembly shall consist of agovernor, deputy governor, twelve assistants, and twodeputies, from every town or city, to be chosen by thefreemen, (the charter nominating the first governor andassistants.) The general assembly had authority to appointjudicatories, make freemen, elect officers, establishlaws, and ordinances "not contrary to the laws ofthis realm of England," to punish offences " accordingto the course of other corporations within this our kingdomof England," to assemble the inhabitants in martialarray for the common defence, and to exercise martiallaw in cases of necessity. The lands were to be holdenas of the manor of East Greenwich, in free and commonsoccage. The inhabitants and their children born therewere to enjoy and possess all the liberties and immunitiesof free, natural-born subjects, in the same manner,as if born within the realm. The right of general fisheryon the coasts was reserved to all subjects ; andfinally the territory bounded on the east by the NarrateHISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK I.gannet river, where it falls into the sea, and on thenorth by Massachusetts, and on the south by the sea,and in longitude, as the line of the Massachusetts colonyrunning from east to west, that from Narragansetbay to the South sea, was granted and confirmed to thecolony. The charter is silent in regard to religiousrights and privileges.^ 37. In 1685, a quo warranto was issued by kingJames against the colony for the repeal of the charter.No judgment appears to have been rendered upon it ;but the colony offered its submission to the will of thecrown; and Sir Edmund Andros, in 1687, went toHartford, and in the name of the crown, declared thegovernment dissolved. They did not, however, surrenderthe charter ; but secreted it in an oak, whichis still venerated ; and immediately after the revolutionof 1688, they resumed the exercise of all its powers.The successors of the Stuart silently suffered themto retain it until the American Revolution, without anystruggle or resistance. The charter continued to bemaintained, as a fundamental law of the State, until theyear 1818, when a new constitution of government wasframed and adopted by the people.CH. VIII.] RHODE ISLAND. 37CHAPTER VIII.RHODE ISLAND.^ 38. Rhode Island was originally settled by emigrantsfrom Massachusetts, fleeing thither to escape fromreligious persecution; and it still boasts of Roger Williams,as its founder, and as the early defender of religiousfreedom and the rights of conscience. One body ofthem purchased the island, which has given the nameto the State, and another the territory of the ProvidencePlantations from the Indians, and began their settlementsin both places nearly at the same period, viz. in1636 and 1638. They entered into separate voluntaryassociations of government. But finding theirassociations not sufficient to protect them againstthe encroachments of Massachusetts, and having notide under any of the royal patents, they sent RogerWilliams to England, in 1643, to procure a surer foundationboth of title and government. He succeeded inobtaining from the Earl of Warwick (in 1643) a charterof incorporation of Providence Plantations ; and also,in 1644, a charter from the two houses of parliament(Charles the First being then driven from his capital)for the incorporation of the towns of Providence, Newport,and Portsmouth, for the absolute government ofthemselves, but according to the laws of England.§ 39. Under this charter an assembly was convened,in 1647, consisting of the collective freemen of the variousplantations. The council of state of the commonwealthsoon afterwards interfered to suspend their government; but the distractions at home prevented anyserious interference by parliament in the administration38 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK I.of their affairs; and they continued to act under theirformer government until the restoration of Charles theSecond. That event seems to have given great satisfactionto these plantations. They immediately proclaimedthe king, and sent an agent to England ; andin July, 1663, after some opposition they succeeded inobtaining a charter from the crown.^ 40. That charter incorporated the inhabitants bythe name of the Governor and Company of the EnglishColony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantationsin New-england in America, conferring on them theusual powers of corporations. The executive powerwas lodged in a governor, deputy governor, and tenassistants, chosen by the freemen. The supremelegislative authority was vested in a general assembly,consisting of a governor, deputy governor, ten assistants,and deputies from the respective towns, chosen bythe freemen, (six for Newport, four for Providence,Portsmouth, and Warwick, and two for other towns,)the governor or deputy and six assistants being alwayspresent. The general assembly were authorized toadmit freemen, choose officers, make laws and ordinances,so as that they were " not contrary and repugnantunto, but as near as may be agreeable to, the lawsof this our realm of England, considering the nature andconstitution of the place and people; to create and organizecourts ; to punish offences according to the courseof other corporations in England;" to array the martialforce of the colony for the common defence, andenforce martial law ; and to exercise other importantpowers and prerogatives. It further provided for a freefishery on the coasts ; and that all the inhabitants andchildren born there should enjoy all the liberties andimmunities of free and natural subjects born within theCH. VIII.] RHODE ISLAND. 39realm of England. It then granted and confirmedunto them all that part of the king's dominions inNew-england containing the Narraganset bay and thecountries and parts adjacent, bounded westerly to themiddle of Pawcatuck river, and so along the river northwardto the head thereof, thence by a straight line duenorth, until it meet the south hne of Massachusetts, extendingeasterly three English miles to the most easternand northeastern parts of Narraganset bay, as thebay extended southerly unto the mouth of the riverrunning towards Providence, and thence along the easterlyside or bank of the said river up to the falls, calledPacket Falls, and thence in a straight line due northtill it meets the Massachusetts line. The territory wasto be holden as of the manor of East Greenwich in freeand common soccage. It further secured a free tradewith all the other colonies.^ 41. It is said, that the general conduct of RhodeIsland seems to have given entire satisfaction to Charlesthe Second during the residue of his reign. Upon theaccession of James, the inhabitants were among the firstto offer their congratulations; and to ask protection fortheir chartered rights. That monarch however disregardedtheir request. They were accused of a violationof their charter, and a quo warranto was filed againstthem. They immediately resolved, without much hesitation,not to contend with the crown, but to surrendertheir charter ; and passed an act for that purpose, whichwas afterwards suppressed. In December, 1686, SirEdmund Andros, agreeably to his orders, dissolvedtheir government, and assumed the administration ofthe colony. The revolution of 1 688 put an end to hispower; and the colony immediately afterwards resumedits charter, and, though not without some interruptHISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK Itions, continued to maintain and exercise its powers,down to the period of the American Revolution. Itstill continues to act under the same charter, as a fundamentallaw, it being the only state in the Unionswhich has not formed a new constitution of governmentIt seems, that until the year 1696 the governor, assistants,and deputies of the towns sat together. But byrelaw then passed they were separated, and the deputiesacted a^ a lower house, and the governor andassistants as an upper house.§ 42. We have now finished our review of all thesuccessive colonies established in New-england. Theremark of Chalmers is in general well founded: "Originallysettled (says he) by the same kind of people, asimilar policy naturally rooted in all the colonies ofNew-england. Their forms of government, their laws,their courts of justice, their manners, and their religious-tenets,which gave birth to all these, were nearly thesame." Still, however, the remark is subject to manylocal qualifications.CH. IX.] MARYLAND. 41CHAPTER IX.MARYLAND.^ 43. The province of Maryland was included originallyin the patent of the Southern or Virginia company;and upon the dissolution of that company it reverted tothe crown. King Charles the First, on the 20th June,1632, granted it by patent to Cecilia Calvert LordBaltimore, the son of George Calvert Lord Baltimore,to whom the patent was intended to have been made,but he died before it was executed. By the charter,the king erected it into a province, and gave it the nameof Maryland, in honor of his Queen, Henrietta Maria, thedaughter of Henry the Fourth of France, to be held ofthe crown of England, he yearly, for ever, renderingtwo Indian arrows. The territory was bounded by aright Hne drawn from Watkins's Point, on Chesapeakebay, to the ocean on the east, thence to that part of theestuary of Delaware on the north, which lieth under the40th degree, where New-england is terminated; thencein a right line by the degree aforesaid to the meridian ofthe fountain of Potomac; thence following its course bythe further bank to its confluence with the Chesapeake,and thence to Watkins's Point.§ 44. The territory thus severed from Virginia, wasmade immediately subject to the crown, and was grantedin full and absolute propriety to Lord Baltimore andhis heirs, saving the allegiance and sovereign dominionto the crown, with all the rights, regalities, and prerogatives,which the Bishop of Durham enjoyed in thatpalatinate, to be held of the crown as of Windsor ,642 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK I.tie, in the county of Berks, in free and common soccage,and not in capite, or by knights' service. The charter furtherprovided, that the proprietary should have authorityby and with the consent of the freemen, or theirdelegates assembled for that purpose, to make all lavesfor the province, " so that such laws be consonant toreason, and not repugnant or contrary, but, as far asconveniently might be, agreeable to the laws, statutes,customs, and rights of this our realm of England."The proprietary was also vested with full executive power;and the establishment of courts of justice was providedfor. The proprietary was also authorized to levysubsidies with the assent of the people in assembly.The inhabitants and their children were to enjoy all therights, immunities, and privileges of subjects born inEngland. The right of the advowson of the churches,according to the establishment of England, and theright to create manors and courts baron, to confer titlesof dignity, to erect ports, and other regalities, wereexpressly given to the proprietary. An exemption ofthe colonists from all tallies on their goods and estates,to be imposed by the crown, was expressly covenantedfor in perpetuity ; an exemption, which hadbeen conferred on other colonies for years only. Licensewas granted to all subjects to transport themselvesto the province ; and its products were to beimported into England and Ireland under such taxesonly, as were paid by other subjects. And the usualpowers in other charters to repel invasions, to suppressrebellions, &c. were also conferred on the proprietary.^ 45. Such is the substance of the patent. AndChalmers has with some pride asserted, that "March.IX.] MARYLAND. 43land has always enjoyed the unrivalled honour of beingthe first colony, which was erected into a province ofthe English empire, and governed regularly by lawsenacted in a provincial legislature."44 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK I.CHAPTER X.New-york.§ 46. Stew-York was originally settled by emigrantsfrom Holland, But the English governmentseems at all times to have disputed the right of theDutch to make any settlement in America ; and theterritory occupied by them was unquestionably withinthe chartered limits of New-england as granted to thecouncil of Plymouth. Charles the Second, soon afterhis restoration, instigated as much by personal antipathy,as by a regard for the interest of the crown, determinedto maintain his right, and in March, 1664, granteda patent to his brother, the Duke of York and Albany,by which he conveyed to him the region extendingfrom the western bank of Connecticut to the easternshore of the Delaware, together with Long Island, andconferred on him the powers of government, civil andmilitary. Authority was given (among other things) tocorrect, punish, pardon, govern, and rule all subjects,that should inhabit the territory according to such laws,ordinances, &c. as the Duke should establish, so alwaysthat the same "were not contrary, but as near as mightbe agreeable to the laws and statutes and governmentof the realm of England," saving to the crown a right tohear and determine all appeals. The usual authoritywas also given to use and exercise martial law in casesof rebellion, insurrection, mutiny, and invasion. A partof this tract was afterwards conveyed by the Duke, bydeed of lease and release, in June, of the same year, toLord Berkeley and Sir George Carteret. By this lattergrant they were entitled to all the tract adjacent toCH. X.] New YORK. ' 45New-england, lying westward of Long Island, andbounded on the east by the liiain sea and partly byHudson's river, and upon the west by Delaware bayor river, and extending southward to the main ocean asfar as Cape May at the mouth of Delaware bay, and tothe northward as far as the northernmost branch ofDelaware bay or river, which is 41 degrees 40 minuteslatitude ; which tract was to be called by the nameof Nova Caesarea, or New-jersey. So that the^terri-tory then claimed by the Dutch as the New-netherlandswas divided into the colonies of New-york andNew-jersey.^ 47. In September, 1664, the Dutch colony wassurprised by a British armament, which arrived on thecoast, and was compelled to surrender to its authority.By the terms of the capitulation the inhabitants were tocontinue free denizens, and to enjoy their property.The Dutch inhabitants were to enjoy the liberty oftheir conscience in divine worship and church discipline;and their own customs concerning their inheritances.The government was instantly assumed by right of conquestin behalf of the Duke of York, the proprietary,and the territory was called New-york. Liberty ofconscience was granted to all settlers. No laws contraryto those of England were allowed; and taxeswere to be levied by authority of a general assembly.The peace of Breda, in 1667, confirmed the title in theconquerors by the rule of uti possidetis. In thenext Dutch war the colony was [reconquered ; but itwas restored to the Duke of York upon the succeedingpeace of 1674.^ 48. As the validity of the original grant to theDuke of York, while the Dutch were in quiet possessionof the country, was deemed questionable, he thought it46 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK I.prudent to ask, and he accordingly obtained, a newgrant from the crown in June, 1 674. It confirmed theformer grant, and empowered him to govern the inhabitantsby such ordinances, as he or his assigns shouldestablish. It authorized him to administer justice accordingto the laws of England, allowing an appeal to theking in council. It prohibited trade thither without hispermission ; and allowed the colonists to import merchandizeupon paying customs according to the laws ofthe realm. Under this charter he ruled the provinceuntil his accession to the throne. No general assemblywas called for several years ; and the people havingbecome clamorous for the privileges enjoyed by othercolonists, the governor was, in 1682, authorized to callanassembly, which was empowered to make laws for(he general regulation of the state, which, however,were of no force without the ratification of the proprietary.Upon the revolution of 1 688, the people of New-yorkimmediately took side in favour of the Prince ofOrange. From this era they were deemed entitled toall the privileges of British subjects, inhabiting a dependentprovince of the state. No charter was subsequentlygranted to them by the crown; and therefore theyderived no peculiar privileges fi*om that source.CH. XI.] New-jersey. 47CHAPTER XI.New-jersey.§ 49. New-jersey, as we have already seen, wasa part of the territory granted to the Duke of York,and was by him granted, in June, 1664, to Lord Berkeleyand Sir George Carteret, with all the rights, royalties,and powers of government, which he himself possessed.The proprietors, for the better setdement ofthe territory, agreed in February, 1664-1665, upon aconstitution • or concession of government, which wasso much relished, that the eastern part of the provincesoon contained a considerable population.§ 50. This constitution continued until the provincewas divided, in 1676, between the proprietors. By thatdivision East New-jersey was assigned to Carteret ;and West New-jersey to William Penn and others, whohad purchased of Lord Berkeley. Carteret then explainedand confirmed the former concessions for theterritory thus exclusively belonging to himself. Theproprietors also of West Jersey drew up another setof concessions for the settlers within that territory.They contain very ample privileges to the people.§ 51. Whether these concessions became the generallaw of the province seems involved in some obscurity.There were many difficulties and contests for jurisdictionbetween the governors of the Duke of Yorkand the proprietors of the Jerseys; and these were notsettled, until after the Duke, in 1680, finally surrenderedall right to both by letters patent granted to the respectiveproprietors. In 1 68 1 , the governor of the proprietorsof West Jersey, with the consent of the general48 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [BOOK I.assembly, made a frame of government embracing someof the fundamentals in the former concessions.§ 52. Carteret died in 1679, and being sole proprietorof East Jersey, by his will he ordered it to be sold forpayment of his debts ; and it was accordingly sold toWilliam Penn and eleven others, who were called theTwelve Proprietors. They afterwards took twelve moreinto the proprietary ship ; and to the twenty-four thusformed, the Duke of York, in March, 1682, made histhird and last grant of East Jersey. Very serious dissensionssoon arose between the two provinces themselves,as well as between them and New York; whichbanished moderation from their councils, and threatenedthe most serious calamities. A quo warranto wasordered by the crown in 1686, to be issued againstboth provinces. East Jersey immediately offeredto be annexed to West Jersey, and to submit to agovernor appointed by the crown. Soon afterwardsthe crown ordered the Jerseys to be annexed to New-england; and the proprietors of East-Jersey made aformal surrender of its patent, praying only for a newgrant, securing their right of soil. Before this requestcould be granted, the revolution of 1688 took place,and they passed under the allegiance of a new sovereign.^ 63. From this period both of the provinces werein a state of great confusion, and distraction ; and remainedso, until the proprietors of both made a formalsurrender of all their powers of government, but not oftheir lands, to Queen Anne, in April, 1 702. The Queenimmediately reunited both provinces into one province;and by commission appointed a governor overthem. He was thereby authorized to govern with theassistance of a council, and to call general assemblies ofCH. XI.] KEW-JERSEY. 49representatives of the people to be chosen by the freeholders,who were required to take the oath of allegianceand supremacy, and the test provided by the actsof Parliament. The general assembly, with the consentof the governor and council, were authorized to makelaws and ordinances for the welfare of the people "notrepugnant, but, as near as may be, agreeable unto thelaws and statutes of this our kingdom of England;"which laws were, however, to be subject to the approbationor dissent of the crown. The governor, withthe consent of the council, was to erect courts of justice;to appoint judges and other officers ; to collate tochurches and benefices ; and to command the militaryforce. Liberty of conscience was allowed to all personsbut Papists.^54. From this time to the American Revolutionthe province was governed without any charter underroyal commissions, substantially in the manner pointedout in the first. The people always strenuously contendedfor the rights and privileges guaranteed to themby the former concessions ; and many struggles occurredfrom time to time between their representatives,and the royal governors on this subject.Abr.50 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK I,CHAPTER XII.PENNSYLVANIA.§ 55. Pennsylvania was originally settled by differentdetachments of planters under various authorities,Dutch, Swedes, and others, which at different timesoccupied portions of land on South or Delaware river.The ascendency was finally obtained over these settlementsby the governors of New-york, acting underthe charter of 1664, to the Duke of York. Chalmers,however, does not scruple to say, that "it is a singularcircumstance in the history of this [then] inconsiderablecolony, that it seems to have been at all Uses governedby usurpers, because their titles were defective."It continued in a feeble state, until the celebrated WilliamPenn, in March, 1681, obtained a patent fromCharles the Second, by which he became the proprietaryof an ample territory, which in honor of his fatherwas called Pennsylvania. The boundaries described inthe charter were on the East by Delaware river fromtwelve miles' distance northwards of New-caste townto the 43d degree of north latitude, if the said river dothextend so far northward ; but if not, then by saidriver so far as it doth extend ; and from the head of theriver the eastern bounds are to be determined by ameridian Une to be drawn from the head of saidriver unto the said 43d degree of north latitude. Thesaid lands to extend westward five degrees in longitude,to be computed from the said eastern bounds, and thesaid lands to be bounded on the north by the beginningof the 43d degree of north latitude ; and on the southby a cu-che drawn at twelve miles' distance from .XH.] PENNSYLVANIA. 61Castle, northward and westward, to the beginning ofthe 40th degree of northern latitude ; and then by astraight line westward to the limits of the longitudeabove mentioned.§ 56. The charter constituted Penn the true andabsolute proprietary of the territory thus described,(saving to the crown the sovereignty of the country, andthe allegiance of the proprietary and the inhabitants,)to be holden of the crown as of the castle of Windsorin Berks, in free and common soccage, and not in capite,or by knight service ; and erected it into a provinceand seignory by the name of Pennsylvania. It authorizedthe proprietary and his heirs and successors tomake all laws for raising money and other purposes,with the assent of the freemen of the country, or theirdeputies assembled for the purpose. But " the samelaws were to be consonant to reason, and not repugnantor contrary, but, as near as conveniently may be, agreeableto law and statutes and rights of this our kingdomof England." The laws for the descent and enjoymentof lands, and succession to goods, and of felonies,to be according to the course in England, until alteredby the assembly. All laws were lo be sent to Englandwithin five years after the making of them, and, if disapprovedof by the crown within six months, to becomenull and void. It also authorized the proprietaryto appoint judges and other officers; to pardon andreprieve criminals ; to establish courts of justice, with aright of appeal to the crown from all judgments ; tocreate cities and other corporations ; to erect ports,and manors, and courts baron in such manors. Libertywas allowed to subjects to transport themselves andtheir goods to the province ; and to import the productsof the province into England ; and to export them from52 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bODK I.thence within one year, the inhabitants observing theacts of navigation, and all other laws in this behalf made.It was further stipulated, that the crown should levy notax, custom, or imposition upon the inhabitants, or theirgoods, unless by the consent of the proprietary or assembly," or by act of Parliament in England." Suchare the most important clauses of this charter, whichhas been deemed one of the best drawn of the colonialcharters, and which underwent the revision, not merelyof the law officers of the crown, but of the then LordChief Justice (North) of England. It has been remarked,as a singular omission in this charter, that thereis no provision, that the inhabitants and their childrenshall be deemed British subjects, and entided to all theliberties and immunities thereof, such a clause beingfound in every other charter. Chalmers has observed,that the clause was wholly unnecessary, as the allegianceto the crown was reserved ; and the common lawthence inferred, that all the inhabitants were subjects,and of course were entitled to all the privileges ofEnglishmen.^ 57. Penn immediately invited emigration to hisprovince, by holding out concessions of a very liberalnature to all setters ; and under his benign and enlightenedpolicy a foundation was early laid for the establishmentof a government and laws, which have beenjustly celebrated for their moderation, wisdom, and justprotection of the rights and liberties of the people.§ 58. It was soon found that the original frame ofgovernment, drawn up before any settlements weremade, was ill adapted to the state of things in an infantcolony. Accordingly it was laid aside, and a new frameof government was, with the consent of the GeneralAssembly, established in 1683. In 1692 Penn wasen. XII.] PENNSYLVANIA. 53deprived of the government of Pennsylvania by Williamand Mary ; but it was again restored to him in the succeedingyear. A third frame of government was establishedin 1696. This again was surrendered, and anew final charter of government was, in October, 1701,with the consent of the General Assembly, established,under which the province continued to be governeddown to the period of the American Revolution. Itprovided for full liberty of conscience and worship ; andfor the right of all persons, professing to believe in JesusChrist, to serve the government in any capacity. Anannual assembly was to be chosen of delegates fromeach county, and to have the usual legislative authorityof other colonial assemblies, and also power to nominatecertain persons for office to the governor. The lawswere to be subject to the approbation of the governor,who had a council of state to assist him in the government.Provision was made in the same charter, thatif the representatives of the province, and territories,(meaning, by territories, the three counties of Delaware,)should not agree to join together in legislation, theyshould be represented in distinct assemblies.54 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK J.CHAPTER XIII.DELAWARE.^ 59. After Penn had become proprietary ofPennsylvania, he purchased of the Duke of York, in1682, all his right and interest in the territory, afterwardscalled the Three Lower Counties of Delaware,extending from the south boundary of the Province, andsituated on the western side of the river and bay ofDelaware to Cape Henlopen, beyond or south of ; and the three counties took the names of newcastle,Kent, and Sussex. At this time they wereinhabited principally by Dutch and Swedes ; and seemto have constituted an appendage to the government ofNew York.^ 60. In the same year, with the consent of thepeople, an act of union with the province of Pennsylvaniawas passed, and an act of settlement of the frameof government in a general assembly, composed ofdeputies from the counties of Delaware and Pennsylvania.By this act the three counties were, underthe name of the territories, annexed to the province; andwere to be represented in the General Assembly, governedby the same laws, and to enjoy the same privilegesas the inhabitants of Pennsylvania. Difficultiessoon afterwards arose between the deputies of the Provinceand those of the Territories ; and after varioussubordinate arrangements, a final separation took placebetween them, with the consent of the proprietary,in 1703. From that period down to the AmericanCH.

[bOOK I.CHAPTER XIV.NORTH AND SOUTH CAROLINA.^ 61. We next come to the consideration of thehistory of the political organization of the Carolinas.That level region, which stretches from the 36th degreeof north latitude to Cape Florida, afforded an ampletheatre for the early struggles of the three great Europeanpowers, Spain, France, and England, to maintain,or acquire an exclusive sovereignty. Various settlementswere made under the auspices of each of therival powers, and a common fate seemed for a while toattend them all. In March, 1662, [April, 1663,] Charlesthe Second made a grant to Lord Clarendon and othersof the territory lying on the Atlantic ocean, and extendingfrom the north end of the island, called Hope-Is) and, inthe South Virginian seas, and within 36 degrees of northlatitude ; and to the west as far as the South Seas; andso respectively as far as the river Mathias upon thecoast of Florida, and within 31 degrees of north latitude; and so west in a direct line to the South seas ;and erected it into a province, by the name of Carolina,to be holden as of the manor of East Greenwich inKent, in free and common soccage, and not in capite,or by knight service, subject immediately to the crown,as a dependency, for ever.^ 62. In 1665, the proprietaries obtained fromCharles the Second a second charter, with an enlargementof boundaries. It recited the grant of the formercharter, and declared the limits to extend north and eastwardas far as the north end of Currituck river or inlet,upon a straight westerly line to Wyonoak creek, whichCH. XIV.] NORTH AND SOUTH CAROLINA. 57lies within or about 36 degrees 30 minutes of northlatitude ; and so west in a direct line as far as the Southseas; and south and westward as far as the degrees of29 inclusive of northern latitude, and so west in a directline as far as the South seas. It then proceeded to constitutethe proprietaries absolute owners and lords ofthe province, saving the faith, allegiance, and sovereigndominion of the crown, to hold the same as of the manorof East-Greenwich in Kent, in free and commonsoccage, and not in capite, or by knight service ; and topossess in the same all the royalties, jurisdictions, andprivileges of the Bishop of Durham in his diocese.^ 6S, In the year 1669, the proprietaries, dissatisfiedwith the systems already established within theprovince, signed a fundamental constitution for the governmentthereof, the object of which is declared to be,"that we may establish a government agreeable to themonarchy, of which Carolina is a part, that we mayavoid making too numerous a democracy." This constitutionwas drawn up by the celebrated John Locke ;and his memory has been often reproached with theilliberal character of some of the articles, the oppressiveservitude of others, and the general disregard of someof those maxims of religious and political liberty, forwhich he has in his treatises of government and otherWritings contended with so much ability and success.Probably there were many circumstances attending thistransaction, which are now unknown, and which mightwell have moderated the severity of the reproach, andfurnished, if not a justification, at least some apologyfor this extraordinary instance of unwise and visionarylegislation.§ 64. It is easy to perceive that this celebrated constitutionwas ill adapted to the feelings, the wants, andAbr. 858 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK I.the opinions of the colonists. The introduction of it,therefore, was resisted by the people, as much as itcould be ; and indeed, in some respects, it was foundimpracticable. Public dissatisfaction daily increased ;and after a few years' experience of its ill arrangements,and its mischievous tendency, the proprietaries,upon the application of the people, (in 1693,) abrogatedthe constitution, and restored the ancient form ofgovernment. Thus perished the labours of Mr. Locke ;and thus perished a system, under the administrationof which, it has been remarked, the Carolinians hadnot known one day of real enjoyment, and that introducedevils and disorders, which ended only with thedissolution of the proprietary government. Perhapsin the annals of the world there is not to be found amore wholesome lesson of the utter folly of all effortsto establish forms of governments upon mere theory ;and of the dangers of legislation without consulting thehabits, manners, feelings, and opinions of the people,upon which they are to operate.§ 65. After James the Second came to the throne,the same general course was adopted of filing a quowarranto against the proprietaries, as had been successfulin respect to the colonies. The proprietaries,with a view to elude the storm, prudently offered tosurrender their charter, and thereby gained time. Beforeany thing definitive took place, the revolution of1688 occurred, which put an end to the hostile proceedings.In April, 1698, the proprietaries madeanother system of fundamental constitutions, whichembraced many of those propounded in the first, and,indeed, was manifestly a mere amendment of them.^ 66. These constitutions (for experience does notseem to have imparted more wisdom to the proprietary.XIV.] NORTH AND SOUTH CAROLINA, 89 1ries on this subject) contained the most objectionablefeatures of the system of government, of the formerconstitutions, and shared a common fate.^ 67. There was at this period a space ot threehundred miles between the Southern and Northernsettlements of Carolina ; and though the whole provincewas owned by the same proprietaries, the legislationof the two great settlements had been hithertoconducted by separate and distinct assemblies, sometimesunder the same governor, and sometimes underdifferent governors. The legislatures continued to remaindistinct down to the period, when a final surrenderof the proprietary charter was made to the crownin 1729. The respective territories were designatedby the name of North Carolina and South Carolina,and the laws of each obtained a like appellation. CapeFear seems to have been commonly deemed, in thecommissions of the governor, the boundary betweenthe two colonies.§ 68. By the surrender of the charter, the wholegovernment of the territory was vested in the crown ;(it had been in fact exercised by the crown ever sincethe overthrow of the proprietary government in 1720 ;)and henceforward it became a royal province ; and wasgoverned by commission under a form of governmentsubstantially like that established in the other royalprovinces. This change of government was veryacceptable to the people, and gave a new impulse totheir industry and enterprise. At a litde later period[1732], for the convenience of the inhabitants, theprovince was divided; and the divisions were distinguishedby the names of North Carolina and SouthCarolina.60 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK I.^ 69. The form of government conferred on Carolina,when it became a royal province, vs^as in substancethis. It consisted of a governor and councilappointed by the crown, and an assembly chosen by thepeople, and these three branches constituted the legislature.The governor convened, prorogued, and dissolvedthe legislature, and had a negative upon thelaws, and exercised the executive authority. He possessedalso the powers of the court of chancery, of theadmiralty, of supreme ordinary, and of appointing magistratesand militia officers.

In the same year, in which Carolina was divided[1732], a project was formed for the settlement of acolony upon the unoccupied territory between therivers Savannah and Altamaha. The object of theprojectors was to strengthen the province of Carolina,to provide a maintenance for the suffering poor of themother country, and to open an asylum for the persecutedprotestants in Europe ; and in common with allthe other colonies to attempt the conversion and civilizationof the natives. Upon application, George theSecond granted a charter to the company, (consistingof Lord Percival and twenty others, among whom wasthe celebrated Oglethorpe,) and incorporated them bythe name of the Trustees for establishing the Colony ofGeorgia in America.^ 71. The charter was obviously intended for a temporaryduration only ; and the first measures adopted bythe trustees, granting lands in tail male, to be held by asort of military service, and introducing other restrictions,were not adapted to aid the original design, orfoster the growth of the colony. It continued to languish,until at length the trustees, wearied with theirown labours, and the complaints of the people, in June?1751, surrendered the charter to the crown. Henceforwardit was governed as a royal province, enjoyingthe same liberties and immunities as other royal provinces; and in process of time it began to flourish, andat the period of the American Revolution, it had attainedconsiderable importance among the colonies.62 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK I.CHAPTER XVI.GENERAL REVIEW OF THE COLONIES.^ 72. We have now finished our brief survey of theorigin and political history of the colonies ; and herewe may pause for a short time for the purpose of somegenera,! reflections upon the subject.^ 73. Plantations or colonies in distant countriesare either, such as are acquired by occupying andpeopling desert and uncultivated regions by emigrationsfrom the mother country; or such as, beingalready cultivated and organized, are acquired by conquestor cession under treaties. There is, however, adifference between these two species of colonies inrespect to the laws, by which they are governed, atleast according to the jurisprudence of the commonlaw. If an uninhabited country is discovered and plantedby British subjects, the English laws are said to beimmediately in force there ; for the law is the birthrightof every subject. So that wherever they go, theycarry their laws with them ; and the new found countryis governed by them.§ 74. This proposition, however, though laid downin such general terms by very high authority, requiresmany limitations, and is to be understood with manyrestrictions. Such colonists do not carry with themthe whole body of the English laws, as they thenexist ; for many of them must, from the nature of thecase, be wholly inapplicable to their situation, andinconsistent with their comfort and prosperity. Thereis, therefore, this necessary limitation implied, thatCH. XVI.] GENERAL REVIEW. 63they carry with them all the laws applicable to theirsituation, and not repugnant to the local and politicalcircumstances, in which they are placed.^ 75. Even as thus stated, the proposition isfull of vagueness and perplexity ; for it must still remaina question of intrinsic difficulty to say, what lawsare, or are not applicable to their situation ; and whetherthey are bound by the present state of things, or areat liberty to apply them in future by adoption, as thegrowth or interests of the colony may dictate. TheEnglish rules of inheritance, and of protection from personalinjuries, the rights secured by Magna Charta, andthe remedial course in the administration of justice, areexamples as clear perhaps as any, which can be stated,as presumptively adopted, or applicable. And yet inthe infancy of a colony some of these very rights, andprivileges, and remedies, and rules, may be in fact inapplicable,or inconvenient, and impolitic. It is not perhapseasy to settle, what parts of the English laws are,or are not in force in any such colony, until either byusage, or judicial determination, they have been recognizedas of absolute force.^ 76. In respect to conquered and ceded countries,which have already laws of their own, a differentrule prevails. In such cases the crown has a right toabrogate the former laws, and institute new ones. Butuntil such new laws are promulgated, the old laws andcustoms of the country remain in full force, unless sofaras they are contrary to our religion, or enact anything,that is malum in se ; for in all such cases thelaws of the conquering or acquiring country shall prevail.This qualification of the rule arises from the presumption,that the crown could never intend to sanctionlaws contrary to religion or sound morals. But64 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK I.although the king has thus the power to change thelaws of ceded and conquered countries, the power isnot unlimited. His legislation is subordinate to the authorityof parliament. He cannot make any newchange contrary to fundamental principles ; he cannotexempt an inhabitant from that particular dominion, asfor instance from the laws of trade, or from the powerof parliament ; and he cannot give him privileges exclusiveof other subjects.^ 77. Mr. Justice Blackstone, in his Commentaries,insists, that the American colonies are principally to bedeemed conquered, or ceded countries. His language is,"Our American Plantations are principally of this lattersort, [i. e. ceded or conquered countries,] being obtainedin the last century either by right of conquest anddriving out the natives, (with what natural justice Ishall not at present inquire,) or by treaties. And,therefore, the common law of England, as such, hasno allowance or authority there ; they being no part ofthe mother country, but distinct, though dependentdominions."^ 78. The doctrine of Mr. Justice Blackstone, maywell admit of serious doubt upon general principles.But it is manifestly erroneous, so far as it is applied tothe colonies and plantations composing our Union. Inthe charters, under which all these colonies were settled,with a single exception, there is, an express declaration,that all subjects and their children inhabitingtherein shall be deemed natural-born subjects, andshall enjoy all the privileges and immunities thereof;and that the laws of England, so far as they are applicable,shall be in force there ; and no laws shall bemade, which are repugnant to, but as near as may beconveniently, shall conform to the laws of England.JCH. XVI.] GENERAL REVIEW. 65Now this declaration, even if the crown previouslypossessed a right to establish what laws it pleased overthe territory, as a conquest from the natives, being afundamental rule of the original setdement of the colonies,and before the emigrations thither, was conclusive,and could not afterwards be abrogated by the crown.It was an irrevocable annexation of the colonies to themother country, as dependencies governed by thesame laws, and entitled to the same rights.^ 79. And so has been the uniform doctrine inAmerica ever since the settlement of the colonies. Theuniversal principle (and the practice has conformed toit)has been, that the common law is our birthright andinheritance, and that our ancestors brought hither withthem upon their emigration all of it, which was applicableto their situation. The whole structure of ourpresent jurisprudence stands upon the original foundationsof the common law.§ 80. We thus see in a very clear light the mode,in which the common law was first introduced into thecolonies ; as well as the true reason of the exceptionsto it to be found in our colonial usages and laws. Itwas not introduced, as of original and universal obligationin its utmost latitude ; but the Imitations containedin the bosom of the common law itself, and indeedconstituting a part of the law of nations, were affirmativelysettled and recognised in the respective chartersof settlement. Thus limited and defined, it has becomethe guardian of our political and civil rights ; it hasprotected our infant liberties ; it has watched over ourmaturer growth ; it has expanded with our wants ; ithas nurtured that spirit of independence, which checkedthe first approaches of arbitrary power ; it has enabledus to triumph in the midst of difficulties and dangersAhr. 9M HISTORY OF THE COLONIES.

XVII.] GENERAL REVIEW. 67CHAPTER XVII.GENERAL REVIEW OF THE COLONIES.^ 81. In respect to their interior polity, the colonieshave been very properly divided by Mr. Justice Black -stone into three sorts ; viz. Provincial, Proprietary, andCharter Governments. First, Provincial Establishments.The constitutions of these depended on therespective commissions issued by the crown to thegovernors, and the instructions, which usually accompaniedthose commissions. These commissions wereusually in one form, appointing a governor as the king'srepresentative or deputy, who was to be governed bythe royal instructions, and styling him Captain Generaland Governor-ins Chief over the Province, and Chancellor,Vice-admiral, and Ordinary of the same. Thecrown also appointed a council, who, besides their legislativeauthority, were to assist the governor in the dischargeof his official duties ; and power was given himto suspend them from office, and, in case of vacancies,to appoint others, until the pleasure of the crown shouldbe known. The commissions also contained authorityto convene a general assembly of representatives of thefreeholders and planters ; and under this authority provincialassemblies, composed of the governor, the council,and the representatives, were constituted ; (the councilbeing a separate branch or upper house, and the governorhaving a negative upon all their proceedings, andalso the right of proroguing and dissolving them;) whichassemblies had the power of making local laws andordinances, not repugnant to the laws of England, but68 HISTORY or THE COLONIES. [BOOK I.as near as may be agreeable thereto, subject to theratification and disapproval of the crown. The governorsalso had power, with advice of council, to establishcourts, and to appoint judges and other magistrates,and officers for the province ; to pardon offences, andto remit fines and forfeitures ; to collate to churchesand benefices ; to levy military forces for defence ; andto execute martial law in time of invasion, war, andrebellion. Appeals lay to the king in council from thedecisions of the highest courts of judicature of theprovince, as indeed they did from all others of thecolonies. Under this form of government the provincesof New-hampshire, New-york, New-jersey, Virginia,the Carolinas, and Georgia, were governed (aswee have seen) for a long period, and some of themfrom an early period after their setdement.§ 82. Secondly, Proprietary Governments. These(as we have seen) were granted out by the crown toindividuals, in the nature of feudatory principalities, withallthe inferior royalties, and subordinate powers oflegislation, which formerly belonged to the owners ofcounties palatine. Yet still there were these expressconditions, that the ends, for which the grant was made,should be substantially pursued ; and that nothingshould be done or attempted, which might derogatefrom the sovereignty of the mother country. In theproprietary government the governors were appointedby the proprietaries, and legislative assemblies wereassembled under their authority; and indeed all theusual prerogatives were exercised, which in provincialgovernments belonged to the crown. Three oily existedat the period of the American Revolution ; viz.the proprietary governments of Maryland, Pennsylvania,and Delaware. The former had this peculiarity in itsCH. Xvi.] GENERAL REVIEW. 69charter, that its laws were not subject to the supervisionand control of the crown; whereas in both the lattersuch a supervision and control were expressly or impliedlyprovided for.^ 83. Thirdly, Charter Governments. Mr. JusticeBlackstone describes them, (1 Comm. 108,) as "in thenature of civil corporations with the power of makingby-laws for their own internal regulation, not contraryto the laws of England; and with such rights andauthorities as are specially given them in their severalcharters of incorporation. They have a governor namedby the king, (or, in some proprietary colonies, by theproprietor,) who is his representative or deputy. Theyhave courts of justice of their own, from whose decisionsan appeal Res to the king and council here inEngland. Their general assembles, which are theirhouse of commons, together with their council of state,being their upper house, with the concurrence of theking, or his representative the governor, make lawssuited to their own emergencies." This is by no meansa just or accurate description of the charter governments.They could not be justly considered, as merecivil corporations of the realm, empowered to pass bylaws; but rather as great political establishments orcolonies, possessing the general powers of government,and rights of sovereignty, dependent, indeed, and subjectto the realm of England ; but still possessing withintheir own territorial limits the general powers oflegislation and taxation. The only charter governmentsexisting at the period of the American Revolution werethose of Massachusetts, Rhode-island, and Connecticut.The first charter of Massachusetts might be open tothe objection, that it provided only for a civil corporationwithin the realm, and did not justify the assumption70 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK I.of the extensive executive, legislative, and judicialpowers, which were afterwards exercised upon theremoval of that charter to America. And a similarobjection might be urged against the charter of thePlymouth colony. But the charter of William andMary, in 1691, was obviously upon a broader foundation,and was in the strictest sense a charter for generalpolitical government, a constitution for a state, withsovereign powers and prerogatives, and not for a meremunicipality. By this last charter the organization ofthe different departments of the government was, insome respects, similar to that in the provincial governments; the governor was appointed by the crown; thecouncil annually chosen by the General Assembly; andthe House of Representatives by the people. But inConnecticut and Rhode-island the charter governmentswere organized altogether upon popular and democraticalprinciples; the governor, council, and assemblybeing annually chosen by the freemen of the colony,and all other officers appointed by their authority. Bythe statutes of 7 & 8 William 3, (ch. 22, § 6,) it wasindeed required, that all governors appointed in charterand proprietary governments should be approved of bythe crown, before entering upon the duties of their office; but this statute was, if at all, ill observed, andseems to have produced no essential change in thecolonial policy.§ 84. The circumstances, in which the colonieswere generally agreed, notwithstanding the diversitiesof their organization into provincial, proprietary, andcharter governments, were the following.§ 85. (1.) They enjoyed the rights and privilegesof British born subjects ; and the benefit of the commonlaws of England; and all their laws were requiredCH. XVII.] GENERAL REVIEW. 71to be not repugnant unto, but, as near as might be,agreeable to the laws and statutes of England. This,as we have seen, was a limitation upon the legislativepower contained in an express clause of all the charters; and could not be transcended without a clearbreach of their fundamental conditions. A very liberalexposition of this clause seems, however, always tohave prevailed, and to have been acquiesced in, if notadopted by the crown. Practically speaking, it seemsto have been left to the judicial tribunals in the coloniesto ascertain, what part of the common law was applicableto the situation of the colonies ; and of course, froma difference of interpretation, the common law, as actuallyadministered, was not in any two of the coloniesexactly the same. The general foundation of the localjurisprudence was confessedly composed of the samematerials ; but in the actual superstructure they werevariously combined, and modified, so as to presentneither a general symmetry of design, nor an unity ofexecution.§ 86. In regard to the legislative power, there wasa still greater latitude allowed ; for notwithstanding thecautious reference in the charters to the laws of England,the assemblies actually exercised the authority toabrogate every part of the common law, except that,which united the colonies to the parent state by thegeneral ties of allegiance and dependency ; and everypart of the statute law, except those acts of Parliament,which expressly prescribed rules for the colonies, andnecessarily bound them, as integral parts of the empire,in a general system, formed for all, and for the interestof all. To guard this superintending authority withmore effect, it was enacted by Parliament in 7 & 8William 3, (ch. 22,) « that all laws, by-laws, usages, and72 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK I.customs, which should be in practice in any of the plantations,repugnant to any law made, or to be made inthis kingdom relative to the-said plantations, shall beutterly void and of none effect."§ 87. It was under the consciousness of the fullpossession of the rights, liberties, and immunities ofBritish subjects, that the colonists in almost all the earlylegislation of their respective assemblies insisted upona declaratory act, acknowledging and confirming them.And for the most part they thus succeed in obtaininga real and effective magna charta of their Liberties. Thetrial by jury in all cases, civil and criminal, was as firmly,and as universally established in the colonies, as inthe mother country.§ 88. (2.) In all the colonies local legislatures wereestablished, one branch of which consisted of representativesof the people freely chosen, to represent anddefend their interests, and possessing a negative uponall laws. We have seen, that in the original structureof the charters of the early colonies, no provision wasmade for such a legislative body. But accustomed asJ the colonists had been to possess the rights and privilegesof Englishmen, and valuing as they did, above allothers, the right of representation in Parliament, as theonly real security for their poUtical and civil liberties,it was easy to foresee, that they would not long endurethe exercise of any arbitrary pqv/er; and that theywould insist upon some share in framing the laws, bywhich they were to be governed. We find accordingly,that at an early period [1619] a house of burgesses wasforced upon the then proprietors of Virginia. In Massachusetts,Connecticut, New-hampshire, and Rhode-island,the same course was pursued. And Mr. Hutchinsonhas correctly observed, that all the colonies beck.XVII.] GENERAL REVIEW. 73fore the reign of Charles the Second, (Maryland aloneexcepted, whose charter contained an express provisionon the subject,) settled a model of government forthemselves, in which the people had a voice, and representationin framing the laws, and in assenting toburthens to be imposed upon themselves. After therestoration, there was no instance of a colony without arepresentation of the people, nor any attempt to deprivethe colonies of this privilege, except during the briefand arbitrary reign of King James the Second.^ 89. (5.) All the colonies considered themselves,not as parcel of the realm of Great Britain, but as dependenciesof the British crown, and owing allegiancethereto, the king being their supreme and sovereignlord. In virtue of its general superintendency thecrown constantly claimed, and exercised the right ofentertaining appeals from the courts of the last resortin the colonies ; and these appeals were heard andfinally adjudged by the king in council. This right ofappeal was secured by express reservation in most ofthe colonial charters. It was expressly provided forbyan early provincial law in New-hampshire, whenthe matter in difference exceeded the true value orsum of c£300 sterling. So, a like colonial law ofRhode-island was enacted by its local legislature in1719. It was treated by the crown, as an inherentright of the subject, independent of any such reservation.And so in divers cases it was held by the courtsof England. The reasons given for the opinion, thatwrits of error [and appeals] he to all the dominionsbelonging to England upon the ultimate judgments giventhere, are, (1.) That, otherwise, the law appointed,or permitted to such inferior dominion might be considerablychanged without the assent of the superiorAbr. 1074 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK I.dominion ; (2.) Judgments might be given to the disadvantageor lessening of the superiority, or to makethe superiority of the king only, and not of the crownof England ; and (3.) That the practice has been accordingly.§ 90. (6.) Though the colonies had a common origin,and owed a common allegiance, and the inhabitants ofeach were British subjects, they had no direct politicalconnexion with each other. Each was independent ofall the others ; each, in a limited sense, was sovereignwithin its own territory. There was neither alliance,nor confederacy between them. The assembly of oneprovince could not make laws for another ; nor conferprivileges, which were to be enjoyed or exercised inanother, farther than they could be in any independentforeign state. As colonies, they were also excludedfrom all connexion with foreign states. They wereknown only as dependencies ; and they followed thefate of the parent country both in peace and war, withouthaving assigned to them, in the intercourse or diplomacyof nations, any distinct or independent existence.They did not possess the power of formingany league or treaty among themselves, which shouldacquire an obligatory force without the assent of theparent state. And though their mutual wants and necessitiesoften induced them to associate for commonpurposes of defence, these confederacies were of acasual and temporary nature, and were allowed as anindulgence, rather thalia as a right. They made severalefforts to procure the establishment of some generalsuperintending government over them all; but theirown differences of opinion, as well as the jealousy ofthe crown, made these efforts abortive. These efforts,however, prepared their minds for the gradual reckonsXVII.]GENERAL REVIEW.filiation of their local interests, and for the gradual developmentof the principles, upon which a union oughtto rest, rather than brought on an immediate sense ofthe necessity, or the blessings of such a general government.^91. But although the colonies were independentof each other in respect to their domestic concerns,they were not wholly alien to each other. On the contrary,they were fellow subjects, and for many purposesone people. Every colonist had a right to inhabit, if hepleased, in any other colony; and, as a British subject,he was capable of inheriting lands by descent in everyother colony. The commercial intercourse of the colonies,too, was regulated by the general laws of the Britishempire ; and could not be restrained, or obstructedby colonial legislation. The remarks of Mr. Chief JusticeJay on this subject are equally just and striking. " Allthe people of this country were then subjects of the kingof Great Britain, and owed allegiance to him ; and allthe civil authority then existing, or exercised here, flowedfrom the head of the British empire. They were,in a strict sense, fellow subjects, and in a variety of respectsone people. When the Revolution commenced, thepatriots did not assert, that only the same affinity andsocial connexion subsisted between the people of thecolonies, which subsisted between the people of Gaul,Britain, and Spain, while Roman provinces, to wit, onlythat affinity and social connexion, which result from themere circumstance of being governed by the sameprince." Different ideas prevailed, and gave occasionto the Congress of 1774 and 1775.§ 92. In respect to the political relations of thecolonies with the parent country, it is not easy to statethe exact limits of the dependency, which was admitted,76 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES [bOOK I.and the extent of sovereignty, which might be lawfullyexercised over them, either by the crown, or by parliament.In regard to the crown, all of the colonies admitted,that they owed allegiance to the crown, as theirsovereign liege lord, though the nature of the powers,which he might exercise, as sovereign, were still undefined.§ 93. In the silence of express declarations wemay resort to the doctrines maintained by the crown-writers,as furnishing, if not an exact, at least a comprehensiveview of the claims of the royal prerogative overthe colonial establishments. They considered it notnecessary to maintain, that all the royal prerogatives,exercisable in England, were of course exercisable inthe colonies ; but only such fundamental rights and principles,as constituted the basis of the throne and itsauthority, and without which the king would cease tobe sovereign in all his dominions. Hence the attributesof sovereignty, perfection, perpetuity, and irresponsibility,which were inherent in the political capacity ofthe king, belonged to him in all the territories subject tothe crown, whatever were the nature of their laws, andgovernment in other respects. Every where he wasthe head of the church, and the fountain of justice ;every where he was entided to a share in the legislation,(except where he had expressly renounced it ;)every where he was generalissimo of all forces, andentitled to make peace or war. But minor prerogativesmight be yielded, where they were inconsistent withthe laws or usages of the place, or were inapplicable tothe condition of the people. In every question, thatrespected the royal prerogatives in the colonies, wherethey were not of a strictly fundamental nature, the firstthing to be considered was, whether the charter of theCH. XVII.] GENERAL REVIEW. 77particular colony contained any express provision onthe subject. If it did, that was the guide. If it wassilent, then the royal prerogatives were in the colonyprecisely the same, as in the parent country ; for in suchcases the common law of England was the common lawof the colonies for such purposes. Hence, if the colonialcharter contained no peculiar grant to the contrary,the king might erect courts of justice and exchequertherein ; and the colonial judicatories, in point of law,were deemed to emanate from the crown, under themodifications made by the colonial assemblies undertheir charters. The king also might extend the privilegeof sending representatives to new towns in thecolonial assemblies. He might control, and enter a nolleprosequi in criminal prosecutions, and pardon crimes,and release forfeitures. He might present to vacantbenefices; and he was entitled to royal mines, treasure-trove,escheats, and forfeitures. No colonial assemblieshad a right to enact laws, except with the assent of thecrown by charter, or commission, or otherwise ; and ifthey exceeded the authority prescribed by the crown,their acts were void. The king might alter the constitutionand form of the government of the colony, wherethere was no charter, or other confirmatory act by thecolonial assembly with the assent of the crown ; and itrested merely on the instructions and commissions given,from time to time, by the crown to its governors. Theking had power also to vest in the royal governors in,the colonies, from time to time, such of his prerogatives,as he should please ; such as the power to prorogue,adjourn, and dissolve the colonial assemblies ; to confirmacts and laws ; to pardon offences ; to act as captaingeneral of the public forces ; to appoint public officers; to act as chancellor and supreme ordinary ; to78 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK I.sit in the highest court of appeals and errors ; toexercise the duties of vice-admiral, and to grant commissionsto privateers. These last and some otherof the prerogatives of the king, were commonly exercisedby the royal governors without objection.§ 94. The colonial assembles were not consideredas standing on the same footing, as parliament, in respectto rights, powers, and privileges ; but as derivingall their energies from the crown, and limited by therespective charters, or other confirmatory acts of thecrown, in all their proceedings. The king might, inrespect to a colonial assembly, assent to an act of assembly,before it met, or ratify it, or dissent from it, afterthe session was closed. He might accept a surrenderof a colonial charter, subject to the rights of third personspreviously acquired ; and give the colony a newcharter, or otherwise institute therein a new form ofgovernment. And it has been even contended, that theking might, in cases of extraordinary necessity or emergency,take away a charter, where the defence or protectionof the inhabitants required it, leaving them inpossession of their civil rights.§ 95. Such are some of the royal prerogatives,which were supposed to exist by the crown-writers inthe colonial establishments, when not restrained by anypositive charter or bill of rights. Of these, many wereundisputed ; but others were resisted with pertinacityand effect in the colonial assemblies.^ 96. In regard to the authority of parliament toenact laws, which should be binding upon them, therewas quite as much obscurity, and still more jealousyspreading over the whole subject. The governmentof Great Britain always maintained the doctrine, that theparliament had authority to bind the colonies in all casesCH. XVII.] GENERAL REVIEW. 79whatsoever. No acts of parliament, however, wereunderstood to bind the colonies, unless expressly namedtherein. But in America, at different times and indifferentcolonies, different opinions were entertainedon the subject. In fact it seemed to be the policy ofthe colonies, as much as possible, to withdraw themselvesfrom any acknowledgment of such authority, exceptso far as their necessities, from time to time, compelledthem to acquiesce in the parliamentary measuresexpressly extending to them. We have already seen,that they resisted the imposition of taxes upon them,without the consent of their local legislatures, from avery early period.§ 97. But it was by no means an uncommon opinionin some of the colonies, especially in the proprietaryand charter governments, that no act of parliamentwhatsoever could bind them without their own consent.An extreme reluctance was shown by Massachusetts toany parliamentary interference as early as 1640; andthe famous navigation acts of 1651 and 1660 were perpetuallyevaded, even when their authority was nolonger denied, throughout the whole of New-england.Massachusetts, in 1679, in an address to the crown,declared, that she "apprehended them to be an invasionof the rights, liberties, and properties of the subjects ofhis majesty in the colony, they not being representedin parliament ; and, according to the usual sayings ofthe learned in the law, the laws of England were boundedwithin the four seas, and did not reach America."However, Massachusetts, as well as the other New-englandcolonies, finally acquiesced in the authority ofparliament to regulate trade and commerce; but deniedit in regard to taxation and internal regulation of thecolonies. As late as 1757, the general court of MasoHistory OF THE COLONIES. [boOK I.sachusetts admitted the constitutional authority of parliamentin the following words: — "The authority of allacts of parliament, which concern the colonies, and extendto them, is ever acknowledged in all the courts oflaw, and made the rule of all judicial proceedings in theprovince. There is not a member of the general court,and we know no inhabitant within the bounds of thegovernment, that ever questioned this authority." Andin another address in 1761, they declared, that "everyact we make, repugnant to an act of parliament extendingto the plantations, is ipso facto null and void. Andat a later period, in 1768, in a circular address to theother colonies, they admitted, "that his majesty's highcourt of Parliament is the supreme legislative power overthe whole empire;" contending, however, that as Britishsubjects they could not be taxed without their ownconsent.^ 98. " In the middle and southern provinces," (weareinformed by a most respectable historian,) "noquestion respecting the supremacy of parliament inmatters of general legislation existed. The authority ofsuch acts of internal regulation, as where made for America,as well as those for the regulation of commerce,even by the imposition of duties, provided these dutieswere imposed for the purpose of regulation, had been atall times admitted. But these colonies, however theymight acknowledge the supremacy of parliament inother respects, denied the right of that body to tax theminternally." If there were any exceptions to the generalaccuracy of this statement, they seem to have beentoo few and fugitive to impair the general result. Inthe charter of Pennsylvania, an express reservation wasmade of the power of taxation by an act of parliament.CH. XVn.] GENERAL REVIEW. 81though this was argued not to be a sufficient foundationfor the exercise of it.§ 99. Perhaps the best general summary of therights and liberties asserted by all the colonies is containedin the celebrated declaration drawn up by theCongress of the Nine Colonies, assembled at New-york,in October, 1765. That declaration asserted,that the colonists "owe the same allegiance to the crownof Great Britain, that is owing from his subjects bornwithin the realm, and all due subordination to that augustbody, the parliament of Great Britain." That thecolonists "are entided to all the inherent rights and libertiesof his [the king's] natural born subjects withinthe kingdom of Great Britain." " That it is inseparablyessential to the freedom of a people, and the undoubtedright of Englishmen, that no taxes be imposed on them,but with their own consent, given personally, or bytheir representatives." That the people of the " coloniesare not, and from their local circumstances cannotbe represented in the house of commons of Great Britain.That the only representatives of these coloniesare persons chosen therein by themselves ; and that notaxes ever have been, or can be, constitutionally imposedupon them, but by their respective legislatures.That all supplies of the crown being free gifts from thepeople, it is unreasonable and inconsistent with theprinciples and spirit of the British constitution for thepeople of Great Britain to grant to his majesty theproperty of the colonies. And that the trial by jury isthe inherent and invaluable right of every British subjectin these colonies."^ 100. But after the passage of the stamp act, in1765, many of the colonies began to examine this subjectwith more care and to entertain very different opine1182 HISTORY OF THE COLONIES. [bOOK I.ions, as to parliamentary authority. The doctrines maintainedin debate in parliament, as well as the alarmingextent to which a practical application of those doctrinesmight lead, in drying up the resources, and prostratingthe strength and prosperity of the colonies, drovethem to a more close and narrow survey of the foundationof parliamentary supremacy. Doubts were sooninfused into their minds ; and from doubts they passedby an easy transition to a denial, first of the power oftaxation, and next of all authority whatever to bind themby its laws. One of the most distinguished of ourwriters during the contest admits, that he entered uponthe inquiry "with a view and expectation of beingable to trace some constitutional line between thosecases, in which we ought, and those, in which we oughtnot to acknowledge the power of parliament over us.In the prosecution of his inquiries he became fully convinced,that such a Hue does not exist ; and that therecan be no medium between acknowledging and denyingthat power in all cases."§ 101. If other colonies did not immediately arrive at thesame conclusion, it was easy to foresee, that the strugglewould ultimately be maintained upon the generalground ; and that a common interest and a commondesire of security, if not of independence, would graduallybring all the colonies to feel the absolute necessityof adhering to it, as their truest and safest defence.In 1773, Massachusetts found no difficulty in contendingin the broadest terms for an unlimited independenceof parliament; and in a bold and decided tone deniedall its power of legislation over them. A distinction wastaken between subjection to parliament, and allegianceto the crown. The latter was admitted ; but theformer was resolutely opposed. It is remarkable, thatCH. XVII.] GENERAL REVIEW. 83the Declaration of Independence, which sets [forth ourgrievances in such warm and glowing colors, does notonce mention parliament, or allude to our connexionwith it ; but treats the acts of oppression therein referredto, as acts of the king, in combination " with others,"for the overthrow of our liberties.^102. The stamp act was repealed; but within afew years afterwards duties of another sort were laid,the object of which was to raise a revenue from importationsinto the colonies. These of course becameas offensive to the colonies as the prior attempt atinternal taxation ; and were resisted upon the samegrounds of unconstitutionality. It soon became obvi- ^vous, that the great struggle in respect to colonial andparliamentary rights could scarcely be decided otherwise,than by an appeal to arms. Great Britain wasresolutely bent upon enforcing her claims by an openexercise of military power ; and on the other hand,America scarcely saw any other choice left to her,but unconditional submission, or bold and unmeasuredresistance.BOOK II.HISTORY OF THE REVOLUTION AND OF THECONFEDERATION.CHAPTER I.THE REVOLUTION.§ 103. We are next to proceed to an historical reviewof the origin of that union of the colonies, whichled to the declaration of independence ; of the effectsof that event, and of the subsequent war upon the politicalcharacter and rights of the colonies ; of the formationand adoption of the articles of confederation ; ofthe sovereign powers antecedently exercised by thecontinental congress ; of the causes of the decline andfall of the confederation ; and finally, of the establishmentof the present constitution of the United States.^ 104. No redress of grievances having followedupon the many appeals made to the king, and to parliament,by and in behalf of the colonies, either conjointlyor separately, it became obvious to them, that a closerunion and co-operation were necessary to vindicatetheir rights, and protect their liberties. If a resort toarms should be indispensable, it was impossible to hopeICH. I.] HISTORY OF THE REVOLUTION. 85for success, but in united efforts. If peaceable redresswas to be sought, it was as clear, that the voice of thecolonies must be heard, and their power felt in a nationalorganization. In 1774 Massachusetts recommendedthe assembling of a continental congress to deliberateupon the state of public affairs ; and accordingto her recommendation, delegates were appointed bythe colonies for a congress, to be held in Philadelphiain the autumn of the same year. In some of the legislaturesof the colonies, which were then in session, delegateswere appointed by the popular, or representativebranch ; and in other cases they were appointedby conventions of the people in the colonies. The congressof delegates (calling themselves in their moreformal acts " the delegates appointed by the good peopleof these colonies ") assembled on the 4th of September,1774 ; and having chosen officers, they adopted certainfundamental rules for their proceedings.^ 105. Thus was organized under the auspices, andwith the consent of the people, acting directly in theirprimary, sovereign capacity, and without the interventionof the functionaries, to whom the ordinary powersof government were delegated in the colonies, the firstgeneral or national government, which has been veryaptly called " the revolutionary government," since inits origin and progress it was wholly conducted uponrevolutionary principles. The congress thus assembled,exercised de facto and de jure a sovereign authority ;not as the delegated agents of the governments defacto of the colonies, but in virtue of original powersderived from the people. The revolutionary government,thus formed, terminated only, when it was regularlysuperceded by the confederated government underthe articles finally ratified, as we shall hereafter see,in 1781.86 HISTORY OF THE REVOLUTION. [bOOK II.§ 106. The first and most important of their actswas a declaration, that in determining questions in thiscongress, each colony or province should have one vote ;and this became the established course during the revolution.They adopted a declaration of rights, not differingin substance from that of the congress of 1765,and affirming, that the respective colonies are entidedto the common law of England and the benefit of suchEnglish statutes, as existed at the time of their colonization,and which they have by experience respectivelyfound to be applicable to their local and othercircumstances. They also adopted addresses to thepeople of England, to the neighbouring British colonies,and to the king, explaining their grievances, andrequesting aid and redress.§ 107. In May, 1775, a second congress of delegatesmet from all the states. These delegates werechosen, as the preceding had been, partly by the popularbranch of the state legislatures, when in session ;but principally by conventions of the people in thevarious states. In a few instances the choice by thelegislative body was confirmed by that of a convention,and e converso. They authorized the raising of continentaltroops, and appointed General Washington commanderin chief, to whom they gave a commission inthe name of the delegates of the united colonies. Theyhad previously authorized certain military measures, andespecially the arming of the militia of New-york, andthe occupation of Crown Point and Ticonderoga. Theyauthorized the emission of two millions of dollars inbills of credit, pledging the colonies to the redemptionthereof. They framed rules for the government pf thearmy. They published a solemn declaration of thecauses of their taking up arms, an address to the king,CH. I.] HISTORY OF THE REVOLUTION. 87entreating a change of measures, and an address to thepeople of Great Britain, requesting their aid, and admonishingthem of the threatening evils of a separation.They erected a general post-office, and organized thedepartment for all the colonies. They apportioned thequota, that each colony should pay of the bills emittedby congress.§ 108. At a subsequent adjournment, they authorizedthe equipment of armed vessels to intercept suppliesto the British, and the organization of a marinecorps. They authorized the grant of commissions tocapture armed vessels and transports in the Britishservice ; and recommended the creation of prize courtsin each colony, reserving a right of appeal to congress.They adopted rules for the regulation of the navy, andfor the division of prizes and prize money. They denounced,as enemies, all, who should obstruct or discouragethe circulation of bills of credit. They authorizedfurther emissions of bills of credit, and created twomilitary departments for the middle and southern colonies.They authorized general reprisals, and theequipment of private armed vessels against British vesselsand property. They organized a general treasurydepartment. They authorized the exportation andimportation of all goods to and from foreign countries,not subject to Great Britain, with certain exceptions ;and prohibited the importation of slaves ; and declareda forfeiture of all prohibited goods. They recommendedto the respective assemblies and conventions of thecolonies, where no government, sufficient to the exigencies,had been established, to adopt such government,as in the opinion of the representatives shouldbest conduce to the happiness and safety of their constituentsin particular, and America in general, and88 HISTORY OF THE RE Volitions. [bOOK II.adopted a preamble, which stated, " that the exerciseof every kind of authority under the crown of GreatBritain should be totally suppressed."§ 109. These measures, all of which progressivelypointed to a separation from the mother country, andevinced a determination to maintain, at every hazard,the liberties of the colonies, were soon followed by moredecisive steps. On the 7th of June, 1776, certainresolutions respecting independency were moved,which were referred to a committee of the whole. Onthe 10th of June it was resolved, that a committee beappointed to prepare a declaration, " that these unitedcolonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independentstates ; that they are absolved from all allegianceto the British crown; and that all political connexionbetween them and the state of Great Britain is,and ought to* be, dissolved." On the 11th of June acommittee was appointed to prepare and digest theform of a confederation to be entered into between thecolonies, and also a committee to prepare a plan oftreaties to be proposed to foreign powers. On the28th of June the committee appointed to prepare a Declarationof Independence brought in a draft. On the2d of July, congress adopted the resolution for Independence; and on the 4th of July they adopted theDeclaration of Independence ; and thereby solemnlypublished and declared, " That these united coloniesare, and of right ought to be, free and independentstates ; that they are absolved from all allegiance to theBritish crown; and that all political connexion betweenthem and the state of Great Britain island ought to be,totally dissolved; and that, as free and independentstates, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace,contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do allCH. I.] HISTORY OF THE REVOLUTION. 89Other acts and things, which independent states may ofright do."§ 1 10. From the moment of the declaration of independence,if not for most purposes at an antecedentperiod, the united colonies must be considered as beinga nation de facto, having a general governmentover it created, and acting by the general consent ofthe people of all the colonies. The powers of thatgovernment were not, and indeed could not be welldefined. But still its exclusive sovereignty, in manycases, was firmly established ; and its controlling powerover the states was in most, if not in all national measures,universally' admitted. The articles of confederation,of which we shall have occasion to speak morehereafter, were not prepared or adopted by congressuntil November, 1777 ; they were not signed or ratifiedby any of the states until July, 1778 ; and theywere not ratified, so as to become obligatory upon allthe states, until March, 1781. In the intermediatetime, congress continued to exercise the powers of ageneral government whose acts were binding on allthe states. And though they constantly admitted thestates to be " sovereign and independent communities; " yet it must be obvious, that the terms wereused in the subordinate and limited sense alreadyalluded to ; for it was impossible to use them inany other sense, since a majority of the states could bytheir public acts in congress control and bind the minority.Among the exclusive powers exercised by congress,were the power to declare war and make peace ;to authorize captures; to institute appellate prizecourts; to direct and control all national, military, andnaval operations; to form alliances, and make treaties;to contract debts, and issue bills of credit upon national.1290 HISTORY OF THE REVOLUTION. [BOOK II.al account. In respect to foreign governments, wewere politically known as the United States* only ; andit was in our national capacity, as such, that we sentand received ambassadors, entered into treaties andalliances, and were admitted into the general communityof nations, who might exercise the right of belligerents,and claim an equality of sovereign powers and prerogatives.^ 111. In respect to the powers of the continentalcongress exercised before the adoption of the articlesof confederation, few questions were judicially discussedduring the revolutionary contest ; for men had notleisure in the heat of war nicely to scrutinize or weighsuch subjects ; inter arma silent leges, . The people,relying on the wisdom and patriotism of congress, silentlyacquiesced in whatever authority they assumed.But soon after the organization of the present government,the question was most elaborately discussed beforethe Supreme Court of the United States, in a casecalling for an exposition of the appellate jurisdiction ofcongress in prize causes before the, ratification of theconfederation. The result of that examination was,that congress, before the confederation, possessed, bythe consent of the people of the United States, sovereignand supreme powers for national purposes ; andamong others, the supreme powers of peace and war,and, as an incident, the right of entertaining appeals inthe last resort in prize causes, even in opposition tostate legislation. And that the actual powers exercisedby congress, in respect to national objects, furnishedthe best exposition of its constitutional authority,since they Emanated from the representatives of thepeople, and were acquiesced in by the people.CH. II.] ORIGIN OF THE CONFEDERATION. 91CHAPTER II.ORIGIN OF THE CONFEDERATION.§ 112. The union, thus formed, grew out of theexigences of the times; and from its nature and objectsmight be deemed temporary, extending only to themaintenance of the common liberties and independenceof the states, and to terminate with the return of peacewith Great Britain, and the accomplishment of the endsof the revolutionary contest. It was obvious to reflectingminds, that such a future separation of the statesinto absolute, independent communities with no mutualties, or controlling national government, would be fraughtwith the most imminent dangers to their common safetyand peace, and expose them not only to the chance ofre-conquest by Great Britain, after such separation indetached contests, but also to all the hazards of internalwarfare and civil dissensions. So, that those, who hadstood side by side in the common cause against GreatBritain, might then, by the intrigues of their enemies,and the jealousies always incident to neighbouring nations,become instruments, in the hands of the ambitiousabroad, or the corrupt at home, to aid in the mutualdestruction of each other; and thus all successivelyfall, the victims of a domestic or foreign tyranny.Such considerations could not but have great weightwith all honest and patriotic citizens, independent ofthe real blessings, which a permanent union could notfail to secure throughout all the states.^ 113. It will be an instructive and useful lesson tousto trace historically the steps, which led to the formationand final adoption of the articles of confederation92 HISTORY OF THE CONFEDERATION. [bOOK II.and perpetual union between the United States. It willbe instructive by disclosing the real difficulties attendantupon such a plan, even in times, when the necessityof it was forced upon the minds of men not only bycommon dangers, but by common protection, by commonfeelings of affection, and by common efforts ofdefence. It will be useful, by moderating the ardour ofinexperienced minds, which are apt to imagine, that thetheory of government is too plain, and the principles,on which it should be formed, too obvious, to leavemuch doubt for the exercise of the wisdom of statesmen,or the ingenuity of speculations. Nothing isindeed more difficult to foresee, than the practicaloperation of given powers, unless it be the practicaloperation of restrictions, intended to control thosepowers.§ 114. On the 1 th of June, 1776, the same day, onwhich the committee for preparing the declaration ofindependence vas appointed, congress resolved, thata committee be appointed to prepare and digest theform of a confederation to be entered into betweenthese colonies ; " and on the next day a committee wasaccordingly appointed, consisting of a member fromeach colony Nearly a year before this period, (viz.on the 21st of July, 1775,) Dr. Franklin had submittedto congress a sketch of articles of confederation,which does not, however, appear to have been acted on.These articles contemplated a union, until a reconciliationwith Great Britain, and on failure thereof, the confederationto be perpetual.§ 115. On the 12th of July, 1776, the committee,appointed to prepare articles of confederation, presenteda draft, which was in the hand-writing of Mr.Dickinson, one of the committee, and a delegate fromCH. II.] ORIGIN OF THE CONFEDERATION.Pennsylvania. The draft, so reported, was debatedfrom the 22d to the 31st of July, and on several daysbetween the 5th and 20th of August, 1776. On thislast day, congress, in committee of the whole, reporteda new draft, which was ordered to be printed for the useof the members.§ 116. The subject seems not again to have beentouched until the 8th of April, 1777, and the articleswere debated at several times between that time andthe 15th of November of the same year. On this lastday the articles were reported with sundry amendments,and finally adopted by congress. A committeewas then appointed to draft, and they accordinglydrafted, a circular letter, requesting the states respectivelyto authorize their delegates in congress to subscribethe same in behalf of the state.^ 117. Notwithstanding the strong and eloquentappeal made to the states in this letter it carried convictionvery slowly to the minds of the local legislatures.Many objections were stated ; and many amendmentswere proposed. All of them, however, were rejectedby congress, not probably because they were all deemedinexpedient or improper in themselves ; but from thedanger of sending the instrument back again to all thestates, for reconsideration. Accordingly on the 26thof June, 1 778, a copy, engrossed for ratification, wasprepared, and the ratification begun on the 9th day ofJuly following. It was ratified by all the states, exceptDelaware and Maryland, in 1778; by Delaware in 1779,and by Maryland on the first of March, 1781, fromwhich last 'date its final ratification took effect, and wasjoyfully announced by congress.94 DECLINE AND FALL [bOOK II.CHAPTER III.DECLINE AND FALL OF THE CONFEDERATION.§ 118. Any survey, however slight, of the confederationwill impress the mind with the intrinsic difficultieswhich attended the formation of its principal features.It is well known, that upon three importantpoints, touching the common rights and interests of theseveral states, much diversity of opinion prevailed, andmany animated discussions took place. The first was,as to the mode of voting in congress, whether it shouldbe by states, or according to wealth, or population.The second, as to the rule, by which the expenses ofthe Union should be apportioned among the states.And the third, relative to the disposal of the vacant andunappropriated lands in the western territory.^ 119. The leading defects of the confederation maybeenumerated under the following heads :In the first place, there was an utter want of all coerciveauthority to carry into effect its own constitutionalmeasures. This, of itself, was sufficient to destroy itswhole efficiency, as a superintending government, ifthat may be called a government, which possessed noone solid attribute of power. It has been justly observed,that "a government authorized to declare war,but relying on independent states for the means ofprosecuting it; capable of contracting debts, and ofpledging the public faith for their payment ; but dependingon thirteen distinct sovereignties for the preservationof that faith ; could only be rescued from ignominyand contempt by finding those sovereigntiesadministered by men exempt from the passions incidentCH. III.] OF THE CONFEDERATION.to human nature." That is, by supposing a case, inwhich all human governments would become unnecessary,and all differences of opinion would become impossible.In truth, congress possessed only the^powerof recommendation.^ 120. The fact corresponded with the theory.Even during the revolution, while all hearts and handswere engaged in the common cause, many of the measuresof congress were defeated by the inactivity ofthe states ; and in some instances the exercise of itspowers were resisted. But after the peace of 1783,such opposition became common, and gradually extendedits sphere of activity, until, in the expressive languagealready quoted, " the confederation became ashadow without the substance." There were nonational courts having original or appellate jurisdictionover cases regarding the powers of the union ; and ifthere had been, the relief would have been but of avery partial nature, since, without some act of statelegislation, many of those powers could not be broughtinto life.§ 121. A striking illustration of these remarks mayhe found in our juridical history. The power of appealin prize causes, as an incident to the sovereign powersof peace and war, was asserted by congress after themost elaborate consideration, and supported by thevoice of ten states, antecedent to the ratification of thearticles of confederation. The exercise of that powerwas, however, resisted by the state courts, notwithstandingits immense importance to the preservationof the rights of independent neutral nations. The confederationgave, in express terms, this right of appeal.The deci;:ees of the court of appeals were equally resisted; and in fact, they remained a dead letter, until96 DECLINE AND FALL [BOOK II.they were enforced by the courts of the United Statesunder the present constitution.^ 122. A farther illustration of this topic may begathered from the palpable defect in the confederation,of any power to give a sanction to its laws. Congresshad no power to exact obedience, or finish disobedienceto its ordinances. They could neither imposefines, nor direct imprisonment, nor divest privileges, nordeclare forfeitures, nor suspend refractory officers.There was in the confederation no express authority toexercise force ; and though it might ordinarily be implied,as an incident, the right to make such implicationwas prohibited, for each state was to " retain everypower, right, and. jurisdiction, not expressly delegatedto congress." The consequence naturally was, that theresolutions of congress were disregarded, not only bystates but by individuals. Men followed their interestsmore than their duties; they cared litde for persuasions,which came without force ; or for recommendations,which appealed only to their consciences or their patriotism.Indeed it seems utterly preposterous to callthat a government, which has no power to pass laws ;or those enactments laws, which are attended with nosanction, and have no penalty or punishment annexedto the disobedience of them.§ 123. But a still more striking defect was the totalwant of power to lay and levy taxes, or to raise revenueto defray the ordinary expenses of government.The whole power, confided to congress upon this head,was the power " to ascertain the sums necessary to beraised for the service of the United States;" and toapportion the quota or proportion on each state. Butthe power was expressly reserved to the states to layand levy the taxes, and of course the time, as well asCH. IV.] OF THE CONFEDERATION. 97the mode of payment, was extremely uncertain. Theevils resulting from this source, even during the revolutionarywar, were of incalculable extent ; and, but forthe good fortune of congress in obtaining foreign loans,it is far from being certain, that they would not havebeen fatal. The principle, which formed the basis ofthe apportionment, was sufficiently objectionable, as ittook a standard extremely unequal in its operation uponthe different states. The value of its lands was by nomeans a just representative of the proportionate contributions,which each state ought to make towards thedischarge of the common burthens.^ 124. But this consideration sinks into utter insignificance,in comparison with others. Requisitionswere to be made upon thirteen independent states ; andit depended upon the good will of the legislature of eachstate, whether it would comply at all ; or if it did comply,at what time, and in what manner. The verytardiness of such an operation, in the ordinary courseof things, was sufficient to involve the government inperpetual financial embarrassments, and to defeat manyof its best measures, even when there was the utmostgood faith and promptitude on the part of the states incomplying with the requisitions. But many reasonsconcurred to produce a total want of promptitude onthe part of the states, and, in numerous instances, atotal disregard of the requisitions. Indeed, from themoment, that the peace of 1783 secured the countryfrom the distressing calamities of wars a general relaxationtook place ; and many of the states successivelyfound apologies for their gross neglect in evils commonto all, or complaints listened to by all. Many solemnand affecting appeals were, from time to time, made bycongress to the states; but they were attended with noAbr. 1398 DECLINE AND FALL [bOOK II.salutary effect. Many measures were devised to obviatethe difficulties, nay, the dangers, which threatenedthe Union ; but they failed to produce any amendmentsin the confederation. An attempt was made by congress,during the war, to procure from the states anauthority to levy an impost of five per cent, upon importedand prize goods; but the assent of all the statescould not be procured. The treasury was empty ; thecredit of the confederacy was sunk to a low ebb ; thepublic burthens were increasing ; and the public faithwas prostrate.^ 125. In February, 1786, congress determined tomake another and last appeal to the states upon thesubject. The report adopted upon that occasion containsa melancholy picture of the state of the nation.In the course of this inquiry (said the report) it mostclearly appeared, that the requisitions of congress foreight years past have been so irregular in their operation,so uncertain in their collection, and so evidentlyunproductive, that a reliance on them in future, as asource, from whence monies are to be drawn to dischargethe engagements of the confederation, definiteas they are in time and amount, would he no less dishonourableto the understandings of those, who entertainedsuch confidence than it would be dangerous tothe welfare and peace of the Union." "It has becomethe duty of congress to declare most explicit, that thecrisis has arrived, when the people ol these UnitedStates, by whose will and for whose benefit the federalgovernment was instituted, must decide, whether theywill support their rank, as a nation, by maintaining thepublic faith at home or abroad ; or whether, for want ofa timely exertion in establishing a general revenue, andthereby giving strength to the confederacy, they willCH. IV.] OF THE CONFEDERATION. 99hazard, not only the existence of the Union, but of thosegreat and invaluable privileges, for which they have soarduously and so honourably contended." After theadoption of this report, three states, which had hithertostood aloof, came into the measure. New-york alonerefused to comply with it ; and after a most animateddebate in her legislature, she remained inflexible, andthe fate of the measure was sealed forever by hersolitary negative.§ 126. Independent, however, of this inability to laytaxes, or collect revenue, the want of any power in congressto regulate foreign or domestic commerce wasdeemed a leading defect in the confederation. Thisevil was felt in a comparatively slight degree during thewar. But when the return of peace restored the countryto its ordinary commercial relations, the want of someuniform system to regulate them was early perceived ;and the calamities, which followed our shipping andnavigation, our domestic, as well as our foreign trade,convinced the reflecting, that ruin impended upon theseand other vital interests, unless a national remedy couldbe devised. We accordingly find the public papers ofthat period crowded with complaints on this subject.It was, indeed, idle and visionary to suppose, that whilethirteen independent states possessed the exclusivepower of regulating commerce, there could be foundany uniformity of system, or any harmony and cooperationfor the general welfare. Measures of a commercialnature, which were adopted in one state from asense of its own interests, would be often countervailed,or rejected by other states from similar motives.If one state should deem a navigation act favourable toits own growth, the efficacy of such a measure mightbe defeated by the jealousy or policy of a neighbouring100 DECLINE AND FALL [bOOK II.State. If one should levy duties to maintain its owngovernment and resources, there were many temptationsfor its neighbours to adopt the system of freetrade, to draw to itself a larger share of foreign anddomestic commerce. The agricultural states mighteasily suppose, that they had not an equal interest in arestrictive system with the navigating states. And, atall events, each state would legislate according to itsestimate of its own interests, the importance of its ownproducts, and the local advantages or disadvantages ofits position in a political or commercial view. To dootherwise would be to sacrifice its immediate interests,without any adequate or enduring consideration; tolegislate for others, and not for itself ; to dispenseblessings abroad, without regarding the security of thoseat home.§ 127. These evils were aggravated by the situationof our foreign commerce. During the war, our commercewas nearly annihilated by the superior navalpower of the enemy ; and the return of peace enabledforeign nations, and especially Great Britain, in a greatmeasure to monopolize all the benefits of our hometrade. In the first place, our navigation, having no protection,was unable to engage in competition with foreignships. In the next place, our supplies were almostaltogether furnished by foreign importers or on foreignaccount. We were almost flooded with foreign manufactures,while our own produce bore but a reducedprice. It was easy to foresee, that such a state ofthings must soon absorb all our means ; and as our industryhad but a narrow scope, would soon reduceus to absolute poverty. Our trade in our own shipswith foreign nations was depressed in an equal degree ;for it was loaded with heavy restrictions in their ports.CH. IV.] OF THE CONFEDERATION. 101While, for instance, British ships with their commoditieshad free admission into our ports, American shipsand exports were loaded with heavy exactions, or prohibitedfrom entry into British ports. We were,therefore, the victims of our own imbecility, and reducedto a complete subjection to the commercial regulationsof other countries, notwithstanding our boasts offreedom and independence. Congress had been longsensible of the fatal effects flowing from this source ;but their efforts to ward off the mischiefs had beenunsuccessful. Being invested by the articles of confederationwith a limited power to form commercialtreaties, they endeavoured to enter into treaties with foreignpowers upon principles of reciprocity. But thesenegotiations were, as might be anticipated, unsuccessful,for the parties met upon very unequal terms. Foreignnations, and especially Great Britain, felt secure inthe possession of their present command of our tradeand had not the least inducement to part with a singleadvantage. It was further pressed upon us, with a truthequally humiliating and undeniable, that congress possessedno effectual power to guaranty the faithful observanceof any commercial regulations ; and there must insuch cases be reciprocal obligations.^ 128. There were other defects seriously urgedagainst the confederation, which, although not of such afatal tendency, as those already enumerated, weredeemed of sufficient importance to justify doubts, as toits efficacy as a bond of union, or an enduring schemeof government. It is not necessary to go at large intoa consideration of them. It will suffice for the presentpurpose to enumerate the principal heads. (1.) Theprinciple of regulating the contributions of the statesinto the common treasury by quotas, apportioned DECLINE AND FALL [bOOK II.cording to the value of lands, which (as has been alreadysuggested) was objected to, as unjust, unequal, andinconvenient in its operation. (2.) That want of amutual guaranty of the state governments, so as to protectthem against domestic insurrections, and usurpationsdestructive of their liberty. (3.) The want of adirect power to raise armies, which was objected to, asunfriendly to vigour and promptitude of action, as wellas to economy and a just distribution of the public burthens.(4.) The right of equal suffrage among all thestates, so that the least in point of wealth, population,and means stood equal in the scale of representationwith those, which were the largest. From this circumstanceit might, nay it must happen, that a majority ofthe states, constituting a third only of the people ofAmerica, could control the rights and interests of theother two thirds. Nay, it was constitutionally, notonly possible, but true in fact, that even the votes ofnine states might not comprehend a majority of thepeople in the Union. The minority, therefore, possesseda negative upon the majority. (5.) The organizationof the whole powers of the general government inasingle assembly, without any separate or distinct distributionof the executive, judicial, and legislativefunctions. It was objected, that either the whole superstructurewould thus fall, from its own intrinsic feebleness; or, engrossing all the attributes of sovereignty,entail upon the country a most execrable form of governmentin the shape of an irresponsible aristocracy.(6.) The want of an exclusive power in the generalgovernment to issue paper money ; and thus to preventthe inundation of the country with a base currency,calculated to destroy public faith, as well as privatemorals. (7.) The too frequent rotation required byCH. IV.] OF THE CONFEDERATION. 103the confederation in the office of members of congress,by which the advantages, resulting from long experienceand knowledge in the public affairs, were lost tothe public councils. (8.) The want of judiciary powerco-extensive with the powers of the general government.§ 129. The last defect, which seems worthy of enumeration,is, that the confederation never had a ratificationof the PEOPLE. Upon this objection, it will besufficient to quote a single passage from the Federalist,as it affords a very striking commentary uponsome extraordinary doctrines recently promulgated." Resting on no better foundation than the consentof the state legislatures, it [the confederation] has beenexposed to frequent and intricate questions concerningthe validity of its powers ; and has, in some instances,given birth to the enormous doctrine of a right of legislativerepeal. Owing its ratification to a law of a state,it has been contended, that the same authority mightrepeal the law, by which it was ratified. However grossa heresy it may be to maintain, that a party to a compacthas a right to revoke that compact, the doctrineitself has had respectable advocates. The possibilityof a question of this nature proves the necessity oflaying the foundations of our national government deeper,than in the mere sanction of delegated authority.The fabric of American empire ought to rest on thesolid basis of the consent of the people. Thestreams of national power ought to flow immediatelyfrom that pure, original fountain of all legitimate authority."^ 130. Whatever may be thought as to some of theseenumerated defects, whether they were radical deficienciesor not, there cannot be a doubt, that others of104 FALL OF THE CONFEDERATION. [BOOK II. CH. IV.]them went to the very marrow and essence of government.There had been, and in fact then were, differentparties in the several states, entertaining opinions hostile,or friendly to the existence of a general government. Theformer would naturally cling to the state governmentswith a close and unabated zeal, and deem the least possibledelegation of power to the Union sufficient, (if anywere to be permitted,) with which it could creep on inasemi-animated state. The latter would as naturallydesire, that the powers of the general governmentshould have a real, and not merely a suspended vitality; that it should act, and move, and guide, and notmerely totter under its own weight, or sink into a drowsydecrepitude, powerless and palsied. But each party musthave felt, that the confederation had at last totally failed,as an effectual instrument of government ; that itsglory was departed, and its days of labour done ; thatit stood the shadow of a mighty name ; that it was seenonly, as a decayed monument of the past, incapable ofany enduring record ; that the steps of its declinewere numbered and finished; and that it must soon begathered to the perishable fragments of other ages.BOOK III.THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.CHAPTER I.ORIGIN AND ADOPTION OF THE CONSTITUTION.§ 131. In this state of things, commissioners wereappointed by the legislatures of Virginia and Marylandearly in 1 785, to form a compact relative to the navigationof the rivers Potomac and Pocomoke, and theChesapeake Bay. The commissioners having met inMarch, in that year, felt the want of more enlargedpowers, and particularly of powers to provide for a localnaval force, and a tariff of duties upon imports.Upon receiving their recommendation, the legislature ofVirginia passed a resolution for laying the subjectof a tariff before all the states composing the Union.Soon afterwards, in January, 1786, the legislature adoptedanother resolution, appointing commissioners, " whowere to meet such, as might be appointed by the otherstates in the Union, at a time and place to be agreed ontotake into consideration the trade of the UnitedStates ; to examine the relative situation and trade ofthe states ; to consider how far a uniform system intheir commercial relations may be necessary to theirAbr. 14106 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.common interest, and their permanent harmony ; andto report to the several states such an act, relative tothis great object, as, when unanimously ratified bythem, will enable the United States in congress assembledto provide for the same."§ 132. These resolutions were communicated to thestates, and a convention of commissioners from fivestates only, viz. New-york, New-jersey, Pennsylvania,Delaware, and Virginia, met at Annapolis, in September,1786. After discussing the subject theydeemed more ample powers necessary, and as wellfrom this consideration, as because a small number onlyof the states was represented, they agreed to come tono decision, but to frame a report to be laid before theseveral states, as well as before congress. In this reportthey recommended the appointment of commissionersfrom all the states, "to meet at Philadelphia, on thesecond Monday of May, then next, to take into considerationthe situation of the United States ; to devisesuch further provisions, as shall appear to them necessary,to render the constitution of the federal governmentadequate to the exigencies of the Union ; and toreport such an act for that purpose to the United Statesin congress assembled, as when agreed to by them,and afterwards confirmed by the legislature of everystate, will effectually provide for the same."^ 133. On receiving this report, the legislature of |Virginia passed an act for the appointment of delegates Jto meet such, as might be appointed by other states, atPhiladelphia. The report was also received in congress.But no step was taken, until the legislature ofNew-york instructed its delegation in congress to movea resolution, recommending to the several states to appointdeputies to meet in convention for the purposeCH. I.] Adoption OF THE CONSTITUTION. 107of revising and proposing amendments to the federalconstitution. On the 21st of February, 1787, a resolutionwas accordingly moved and carried in congress,recommending a convention to meet in Philadelphia,on the second Monday of May ensuing, " for the purposeof revising the articles of confederation, and reportingto congress, and the several legislatures, suchalterations and provisions therein, as shall, w^hen agreedto in congress, and confirmed by the states, render thefederal constitution adequate to the exigencies of government,and the preservation of the Union." Thealarming insurrection then existing in Massachusetts,without doubt, had no small share in producing thisresult. The report of congress, on that subject, atonce demonstrates their fears, and their political weakness.^ 134. At the time and place appointed, the representativesof twelve states assembled. Rhode-islandalone declined to appoint any on this momentous occasion.After very protracted deliberations, the conventionfinally adopted the plan of the present constitution,on the 17th of September, 1787 ; and by a contemporaneousresolution, directed it to be " laid beforethe United States in congress assembled," and declaredtheir opinion, " that it should afterwards be submittedto a convention of delegates chosen in each state bythe people thereof, under a recommendation of its legislature,for their assent and ratifications and that eachconvention, assenting to and ratifying the same, shouldgive notice thereof to congress. The convention by afurther resolution declared their opinion, that as soonas nine states had ratified the constitution, congressshould fix a day, on which electors should be appointedby the states, which should have ratified the same,108 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.and a day, on which the electors should assembleand vote for the president, and the time and place ofcommencing proceedings under the constitution ; andthat after such publication, the electors should be appointed,and the senators and representatives elected.The same resolution contained further recommendationsfor the purpose of carrying the constitution intoeffect.§ 135. Congress, having received the report of theconvention, on the 28th of September, 1787, unanimouslyresolved, " that the said report, with the resolutionsand letter accompanying the same, be transmitted tothe several legislatures in order to be submitted to aconvention of delegates chosen in each state by the peoplethereof, in conformity to the resolves of the convention,made and provided in that case."§ 136. Conventions in the various states, which hadbeen represented in the general convention, were accordinglycalled by their respective legislatures ; andthe constitution having been ratified by eleven out ofthe twelve states, congress, on the 13th of September,1788, passed a resolution appointing the first Wednesdayin January following, for the choice of electors ofpresident; the first Wednesday of February following,for the assembling of the electors to vote for a president ;and the first Wednesday of March following, at thethen seat of congress [New-york] the time and placefor commencing proceedings under the constitution.Electors were accordingly appointed in the severalstates, who met and gave their votes for a president ;and the other elections for senators and representativeshaving been duly made, on Wednesday, the 4th ofMarch, 1789, congress assembled under the new constitution,and commenced proceedings under it. ACH. I.] ADOPTION OF THE CONSTITUTION. 109quorum of both houses, however, did not assemble untilthe 6th of April, when the votes for president beingcounted, it was found that George Washington wasunanimously elected president, and John Adams waselected vice-president. On the 30th of April, presidentWashington was sworn into office, and the governmentthen went into full operation in all its departments.§ 137. North Carolina had not, as yet, ratified theconstitution. The first convention called in that state,in August, 1 788, refused to ratify it without some previousamendments, and a declaration of rights. In asecond convention, however, called in November, 1789,this state adopted the constitution. The state ofRhode-island had declined to call a convention ; but*finally, by a convention held in May, 1790, its assentwas obtained ; and thus all the thirteen original statesbecame parties to the new government.^ 138. Thus was achieved another, and still moreglorious triumph in the cause of national liberty, thaneven that, which separated us from the mother country.By it we fondly trust, that our republican institutionswill grow up, and be nurtured into more mature strengthand vigour ; our independence be secured againstforeign usurpation and aggression ; our domestic blessingsbe widely diffused, and generally felt ; and ourunion, as a people, be perpetuated, as our own truestglory and support, and as a proud example of a wiseand beneficent government, entitled to the respect, ifnot to the admiration of mankind.r110 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.CHAPTER IT.OBJECTIONS TO THE CONSTITUTION.^ 139. Let it not, however, be supposed, that aconstitution, which is now looked upon with suchgeneral favour and affection by the people, had no difficultiesto encounter at its birth. The history of thosetimes is full of melancholy instruction on this subject,at once to admonish us of past dangers, and to awakenus to a lively sense of the necessity of future vigilance.The constitution was adopted unanimously by Georgia,New-jersey, and Delaware. It was supported bylarge majorities in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Maryland,and South Carolina. It was carried in the other statesby small majorities, and especially in Massachusetts,New-york, and Virginia, by little more than a preponderatingvote.§ 140. Some of the objections were to the supposeddefects and omissions in the instrument ; others wereto the nature and extent of the powers conferred by it ;and others again to the fundamental plan or scheme ofits organization.(1.) It was objected in the first place, that thescheme of government was radically wrong, because itwas not a confederation of the states ; but a governmentover individuals. It was said, that the federalform, which regards the Union, as a confederation ofsovereign states, ought to have been preserved ; insteadof which the convention had framed a nationalgovernment, which regards the Union, as a consolidationof states. This objection was far from being unica.II.] Objections TO TUB CONSTITUTION* 111versal ; for many admitted, that there ought to be agovernment over individuals tOfaVceitain extent, but byno means to the extent proposed Fit is obvious, thatthis objection, pushed to its full extent, went to the oldquestion of the confederation ; and was but a re-argumentof the point, whether there should exist a nationalgovernment adequate to the protection and support of theUnion. In its mitigated form it was a mere question,as to the extent of powers to be confided to the generalgovernment, and was to be classed accordingly.It was urged, however, with no inconsiderable forceand emphasis ; and its supporters predicted with confidence,that a government so organized would soonbecome corrupt and tyrannical, " and absorb the legislative,executive, and judicial powers of the severalstates, and produce from their ruins one consolidatedgovernment, which, from the nature of things, would beaniron-handed despotism."^ 141. But the friends of the constitution met theobjection by asserting the indispensable necessity ofa form of government, like that proposed, and demonstratingthe utter imbecility of a mere confederation,without powers acting directly upon individuals. Theyconsidered, that the constitution was partly federal,and partly national in its character, and distribution*of powers. In its origin and establishment it wasfederal. In some of its relations it was federal ; inothers, national. In the senate it was federal ; in thehouse of representatives it was national ; in the executiveit was of a compound character ; in the operationof its powers it was national ; in the extent of its powers,federal. It acted on individuals, and not on statesmerely. But its powers were limited, and left a largemass of sovereignty in the states. In making CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.ments, it was also of a compound character, requiringthe concurrence of more than a majority, and less thanthe whole of the states. So, that on the whole theirconclusion was, that " the constitution is, in strictness,neither a national nor a federal constitution, but a compositionof both. In its foundation it is federal, notnational ; in the sources, from which the ordinary powersof the government are drawn, it is partly federal andpartly national ; in the operation of these powers it isnational, not federal; in the extent of them again it isfederal, not national ; and, finally, in the authoritativemode of introducing amendments it is neither whollyfederal, nor wholly national."^ 142. If the original structure of the governmentwas, as has been shown, a fertile source of opposition,another objection of a more wide and imposing naturewas drawn from the nature and extent of its powers.This, indeed, like the former, gave rise to most animateddiscussions, in which reason was employed to demonstratethe mischiefs of the system, and imaginationto portray them in all the exaggerations, which fear andprophesy could invent. Looking back, indeed, to thatperiod with the calmness, with which we naturallyreview events and occurrences, which are now felt onlyas matters of history, one is surprised at the futility ofsome of the objections, the absurdity of others, and theoverwrought colouring of almost all, which were urgedon this head against the constitution. That some ofthem had a just foundation, need not be denied or concealed; for the system was human, and the result ofcompromise and conciliation, in which something of thecorrectness of theory was yielded to the interests orprejudices of particular states, and something of inequalityof benefit borne for the common good.CH. II.] OBJECTIONS TO THE CONSTITUTION. 1 13^ 143. The objections from different quarters werenot only of different degrees and magnitude, but oftenof totally opposite natures. With some persons themass of the powers was a formidable objection ; withothers, the distribution of those powers. With somethe equality of vote in the senate was exceptionable ;with others the inequality of representation in the house.With some the power of regulating the times andplaces of elections was fatal ; with others the power ofregulating commerce by a bare majority. With somethe power of direct taxation was an intolerable grievance; with others the power of indirect taxation byduties on imports. With some the restraint of the statelegislatures from laying duties upon exports, and passingex post facto laws, was incorrect ; with others thelodging of the executive power in a single magistrate.With some the term of office of the senators and f e-representatives was too long ; with others the term ofoffice of the president was obnoxious to a like censure,as well as his re-eligibility. With some the intermixtureof the legislative, executive, and judicial functions in thesenate was a mischievous departure from all ideas ofregular government ; with others the non-participationof the house of representatives in the same functionswas the alarming evil. With some the powers of thepresident were alarming and dangerous to liberty ; withothers the participation of the senate in some of thosepowers. With some the powers of the judiciary werefar too extensive ; with others the power to make treatieseven with the consent of two thirds of the senate.With some the power to keep up a standing army wasa sure introduction to despotism ; with others the powerover the militia. With some the paramount authorityof the constitution, treaties, and laws of theAbr. 15114 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOQK III.United States was a dangerous feature ; with othersthe small number composing the senate and the houseof representatives was an alarming and corruptingevil.^ 144. Another class of objections urged against theconstitution was founded upon its deficiencies andomissions. It cannot be denied, that some of the objectionson this head were well taken, and that therewas a fitness in incorporating some provision on thesubject into the fundamental articles of a free government.There were others again, which might fairlyenough be left to the legislative discretion, and to thenatural influences of the popular voice in a republicanform of government. There where others again sodoubtful, both in principle and policy, that they mightproperly be excluded from any system aiming at permanencein its securities as well as in its foundations.§ 145. Among the defects which were enumerated,none attracted more attention, or were urged with morezeal, than the want of a distinct bill of rights, whichshould recognise the fundamental principles of a freerepublican government, and the right of the people tothe enjoyment of life, liberty, property, and the pursuitof happiness.§ 146. Besides these, there were other defects reliedon, such as the want of a suitable provision for arotation in office, to prevent persons enjoying them forlife ; the want of an executive council for the president ;the want of a provision limiting the duration of standingarmies ; the want of a clause securing to the people theenjoyment of the common law ; the want of securityfor proper elections of public officers ; the want of aprohibition of members of congress holding any publicoffices, and of judges holding any other offices ; andCH. II.] OBJECTIONS TO THE CONSTITUTION. 115finally the want of drawing a clear and direct line betweenthe powers to be exercised by congress and bythe states.§ 147. Many of these objections found their way intothe amendments, which, simultaneously with the ratification,were adopted in many of the state conventions.With the view of carrying into effect the popular will,and also of disarming the opponents of the constitutionof all reasonable grounds of complaint, congress, at itsvery first session, took into consideration the amendmentsso proposed ; and by a succession of supplementaryarticles provided, in substance, a bill of rights, andsecured by constitutional declarations most of the otherimportant objects thus suggested. These articles (inall, twelve) were submitted by congress to the statesfor their ratification ; and ten of them were finally ratifiedby the requisite number of states ; and thus becameincorporated into the constitution. It is a curiousfact, however, that although the necessity of theseamendments had been urged by the enemies of theconstitution, and denied by its friends, they encounteredscarcely any other opposition in the state legislatures,than what was given by the very party, which hadraised the objections. The friends of the constitutiongenerally supported them upon the ground of a largepublic policy, to quiet jealousies, and to disarm resentments.116 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.CHAPTER III.NATURE OF THE CONSTITUTION — WHETHER ACOMPACT.^ 148. Having thus sketched out a general historyof the origin and adoption of the constitution of theUnited States, and a summary of the principal objectionsand difficulties, which it had to encounter, weareat length arrived at the point, at which it may beproper to enter upon the consideration of the actualstructure, organization, and powers, which belong toit§ 149. Before doing this, however, it seems necessary,in the first place, to bestow some attention uponseveral points, which have attracted a good deal of discussion,and which are preliminary in their own nature ;and in the next place to consider, what are the truerules of interpretation belonging to the instrument.^ 150. In the first place, what is the true nature andimport of the instrument 7 Is it a treaty, a convention,a league, a contract, or a compact ? Who are the partiesto it 1 By whom was it made ? By whom wasit ratified ? What are its obligations ? By whom, andin what manner may it be dissolved ? Who are todetermine its validity and construction? Who areto decide upon the supposed infractions and violationsof it? These are questions often asked, and oftendiscussed, not merely for the purpose of theoreticalspeculation ; but as matters of practical importance,and of earnest and even of vehement debate. Theanswers given to them by statesmen and jurists areCH. II.] NATURE OF THE CONSTITUTION. 117often contradictory, and irreconcilable with eachother ; and the consequences, deduced from the viewstaken of some of them, go very deep into the foundationsof the government itself, and expose it, ifnot to utter destruction, at least to evils, whichthreaten its existence, and disturb the just operationof its powers.^ 151. In what light, then, is the constitution of theUnited States to be regarded 7 Is it a mere compact,treaty, or confederation of the states composing theUnion, or of the people thereof, whereby each of theseveral states, and the people thereof, have respectivelybound themselves to each other? Or is it a form ofgovernment, which, having been ratified by a majorityof the people in all the states, is obligatory upon them,as the prescribed rule of conduct of the sovereign power,to the extent of its provisions 1^ 152. Let us consider, in the first place, whether itis to be deemed a compact. By this, we do not meanan act of solemn assent by the people to it, as a formof government, (of which there is no room for doubt ;)but a contract imposing mutual obligations, and contemplatingthe permanent subsistence of parties havingan independent right to construe, control, and judge ofits obligations. If in this latter sense it is to be deemeda compact, it must be, either because it contains on itsface stipulations to that effect, or because it is necessarilyimplied from the nature and objects of a frame ofgovernment.§ 153. There is nowhere found upon the face of theconstitution any clause, intimating it to be a compact,or in anywise providing for its interpretation, as such.On the contrary, the preamble emphatically speaks ofit, as a solemn ordinance and establishment of governessCONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.ment. The language is, " We, the people of the UnitedStates, do ordain and establish this constitution forthe United States of America." The people do ordainand establish, not contract and stipulate with each other.The people of the United States, not the distinct peopleof a particular state with the people of the other states.The people ordain and establish a " constitutions not aconfederation,''^ The distinction between a constitutionand a confederation is well known, and understood.The latter, or at least a pure confederation, is a meretreaty or league between independent states, and bindsno longer, than during the good pleasure of each. Itrests forever in articles of compact, where each is, ormay be the supreme judge of its own rights and duties.The former is a permanent form of government, wherethe powers, once given, are irrevocable, and cannotbe resumed or withdrawn at pleasure. Whether formedby a single people, or by different societies of people,in their political capacity, a constitution, though originatingin consent, becomes, when ratified, obligatory, asafundamental ordinance or. law. The constitution ofa confederated republic, that is, of a national republic,formed of several states, is, or at least may be, not lessan irrevocable form of government, than the constitutionof a state formed and ratified by the aggregate ofthe several counties of the state.§ 154. If it had been the design of the framers of theconstitution or of the people, who ratified it, to considerit a mere confederation, resting on treaty stipulations, itis difficult to conceive, that the appropriate terms shouldnot have been found in it. The United States wereno strangers to compacts of this nature. They hadsubsisted to a limited extent before the revolution. Thearticles of confederation, though in some few respectsCH. III.] NATURE OF THE CONSTITUTION. 119national, were mainly of a pure federative character,and were treated as stipulations between states, formany purposes independent and sovereign. And yet,(as has been already seen,) it was deemed a poUticalheresy to maintain, that under it any state had a rightto withdraw from it at pleasure, and repeal its operation; and that a party to the compact had a right torevoke that compact.§ 155. But that, which would seem conclusive onthe subject, (as has been already stated,) is the verylanguage of the constitution itself, declaring it to be asupreme fundamental law, and to be of judicial obligation,and recognition in the administration of justice."This constitution," says the sixth article, "and thelaws of the United States, which shall be made in pursuancethereof, and all treaties made, or which shall bemade under the authority of the United States, shall hethe supreme law of the land ; and the judges in everystate shall be bound thereby, anie thing in the constitutionor laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding."If it is the supreme law, how can the people ofany state, either by any form of its own constitution, orlaws, or other proceedings, repeal, or abrogate, or suspendit 1§ 156. But if the language of the constitution wereless explicit and irresistible, no other inference couldbe correctly deduced from a view of the nature andobjects of the instrument. The design is to establish aform of government. This, of itself, imports legal obligation,permanence, and uncontrollability by any, butthe authorities authorized to alter, or abolish it. Theobject was to secure the blessings of liberty to thepeople, and to their posterity. The avowed intentionwas to supercede the old confederation, and substitute120 CONSTITUTION OP THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.in its place a new form of government. We have seen,that the inefficiency of the old confederation forced thestates to surrender the league then existing, and toestablish a national constitution. The convention also,which framed the constitution, declared this in the letteraccompanying it. " It is obviously impracticable inthe federal government of these states," says that letter,"to secure all rights of independent sovereignty to each,and yet provide for the interest and safety of all. Individualsentering into society must give up a share ofPuberty to preserve the rest." " In all our deliberationson this subject, we kept steadily in our view that, whichI appeared to us the greatest interest of every trueamerican, the consolidation of our Union, in which isinvolved our prosperity, felicity, safety, perhaps ournational existence." Could this be attained consistentlywith the notion of an existing treaty or confederacy,which each at its pleasure was at liberty to dissolve1^ 157. It is also historically known, that one of theobjections taken by the opponents of the constitutionwas, " that it is not a confederation of the states, but agovernment of individuals." It was, nevertheless, inthe solemn instruments of ratification by the people ofthe several states, assented to, as a constitution. Andalthough many declarations of rights, many propositionsof amendments, and many protestations of i servedpowers, are to be found accompanying the ratificationsof the various conventions, sufficiently evince of theextreme caution and jealousy of those bodies, and ofthe people at large, it is remarkable, that there is nowhereto be found the slightest allusion to the instrument,as a confederation or compact of states in theirsovereign capacity, and no reservation of any right, onCH. III.] NATURE OF THE CONSTITUTION. 121the part of any state, to dissolve its connexion, or toabrogate its assent, or to suspend the operations of theconstitution, as to itself.§ 158. So that there is very strong negative testismony against the notion of its being a compact or confederation,founded upon the known history of the)times, and the acts of ratification, as well as upon theantecedent articles of confederation. The latter purportedon their face to be a mere confederacy. Thelanguage of the third article was, "The said stateshereby severally enter into a firm league of friendshipwith each other for their common defence, &c. bindingthemselves to assist each other." And the ratificationwas by delegates of the state legislatures, who solemnlyplighted and engaged the faith of their respectiveconstituents, that they should abide by the determinationof the United States in congress assembled on allquestions, which by the said confederation, are submittedto them ; and that the articles thereof should beinviolably observed by the states they respectivelyrepresented.§ 159. It is not unworthy of observation, that in thedebates of the various conventions called to examineand ratify the constitution, this subject did not passwithout discussion. The opponents, on many occasions,pressed the objection, that it was a consolidatedgovernment, and contrasted it with the confederation.None of its advocates pretended to deny, that its de \sign was to establish a national government, as contradistinguishedfrom a mere league or treaty, howeverthey might oppose the suggestion, that it was a consolidationof the states.§ 160. The cardinal conclusion, for which this doctrineof a compact has been, with so much ingenuityAhr. 16122 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III*and ability, forced into the language of the constitution,(for the latter no where alludes to it,) is avowedlyto establish, that in construing the constitution, there isno common umpire ; but that each state, nay each departmentof the government of each state, is the supremejudge for itself, of the powers, and rights, and duties,arising under that instrument.^ 161. But if it were admitted, that the constitutionis a compact, the conclusion, that there is no commonarbiter, would neither be a necessary, nor a natural conclusionfrom that fact standing alone. To decide uponthe point, it would still behove us to examine the veryterms of the constitution, and the delegation of powersunder it. It would be perfectly competent even forconfederated states to agree upon,and delegate authorityto construe the compact to a common arbiter. Thepeople of the United States had an unquestionableright to confide this power to the government of theUnited States, or to any department thereof, if theychose so to do. The question is, whether they havedone it. If they have, it becomes obligatory and bindingupon all the states.^ 1 62. It is not, then, by artificial reasoning foundedupon theory, but upon a careful survey of the languageof the constitution itself, that we are to interpret itspowers, and its obligations. We are to treat it, as itpurports on its face to be, as a constitution of government; and we are to reject all other appellations,and definitions of it, such, as that it is a compact, especiallyas they may mislead us into false constructionsand glosses, and can have no tendency to instruct usin its real objects.CH. IV.] FINAL INTERPRETER. 123CHAPTER IV.WHO IS THE FINAL JUDGE OR INTERPRETER IN ConstitutionalCONTROVERSIES.^ 163. The consideration of the question, whetherthe constitution has made provision for any commonarbiter to construe its powers and obligations, wouldproperly find a place in the analysis of the differentclauses of that instrument. But, as it is immediatelyconnected with the subject before us, it seems expedientin this place to give it a deliberate attention.^ 164. In order to clear the question of all minorpoints, which might embarrass us in the discussion, it isnecessary to suggest a few preliminary remarks. Theconstitution, contemplating the grant of limited powers,and distributing them among various functionaries, andthe state governments, and their functionaries, beingalso clothed with limited powers, subordinate to thosegranted to the general government, whenever anyquestion arises, as to the exercise of any power by anyof these functionaries under the state, or federal government,it is of necessity, that such functionaries must,in the first instance, decide upon the constitutionallyof the exercise of such power. It may arise in thecourse of the discharge of the functions of any one, orof all, of the great departments of government, the executive,the legislative, and the judicial. The officersof each of these departments are equally bound bytheir oaths of office to support the constitution of theUnited States, and are therefore conscientiously boundto abstain from all acts, which are inconsistent with it.Whenever, therefore, they are required to act m a case,124 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.not hitherto settled by any proper authority, thesefunctionaries must, in the first instance, decide, eachfor himself, whether, consistently with the constitution,the act can be done. If, for instance, the presidentis required to do any act, he is not only authorized,but required, to decide for himself, whether, consistentlywith his constitutional duties, he can do theact. So, if a proposition be before congress, everymember of the legislative body is bound to examine,and decide for himself, whether the bill or resolutionis within the constitutional reach of the legislativepowers confided to congress. And in many cases thedecisions of the executive and legislative departments,thus made, become final and conclusive, being fromtheir very nature and character incapable of revision.Thus, in measures exclusively of a political, legislative,or executive character, it is plain, that as the supremeauthority, as to these questions, belongs to the legislativeand executive departments, they cannot be re-examinedelsewhere. Thus, congress having thepower to declare war, to levy taxes, to appropriatemoney, to regulate intercourse and commerce withforeign nations, their mode of executing these powerscan never become the subject of re-examination inany other tribunal. So the power to make treatiesbeing confided to the president and senate, when atreaty is properly ratified, it becomes the law of theland, and no other tribunal can gainsay its stipulations.Yet cases may readily be imagined, in which a tax maybelaid, or a treaty made, upon motives and groundswholly beside the intention of the constitution. Theremedy, however, in such cases is solely by an appealto the people at the elections ; or by the salutary powerof amendment, provided by the constitution itself.CH. IV.] FINAL INTERPRETER. 125^ 165. But, where the question is of a different nature,and capable of judicial inquiry and decision, thereit admits of a very different consideration. The decisionthen made, vi^hether in favour, or against theconstitutionality of the act, by the state, or by the nationalauthority, by the legislature, or by the executive,being capable, in its own nature, of being brought tothe test of the constitution, is subject to judicial revision.It is in such cases, as we conceive, that there is afinal and common arbiter provided by the constitutionitself, to whose decisions all others are subordinate ;and that arbiter is the supreme judicial authority ofthe courts of the Union.§ 166. Let us examine the grounds, on which thisdoctrine is maintained. The constitution declares,(Art. 6,) that " This constitution and the laws of theUnited States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof,and all treaties, &c. shall be the supreme law of theland." It also declares, (Art. 3,) that " The judicialpower shall extend to all cases in law and equity, arisingunder this constitution, the laws of the UnitedStates and treaties made, and which shall be madeunder their authority." It further declares, (Art. 3,)that the judicial power of the United States " shall bevested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts,as the congress may, from time to time, ordain and establish."Here, then, we have express, and determinateprovisions upon the very subject. Nothing is imperfect,and nothing is left to implication. The constitutionis the supreme law ; the judicial power extendsto all cases arising in law and equity under it ;and the courts of the United States are, and, in thelast resort, the Supreme Court of the United States is,to be vested with this judicial power. No man can126 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.doubt or deny, that the power to construe the constitutionis a judicial power. The power to construe atreaty is clearly so, when the case arises in judgmentin a controversy between individuals. The like principlemust apply, where the meaning of the constitutionarises in a judicial controversy ; for it is an appropriatefunction of the judiciary to construe laws.If, then, a case under the constitution does arise, if itis capable of judicial examination and decision, wesee, that the very tribunal is appointed to make thedecision. The only point left open for controversy is,whether such decision, when made, is conclusive, andbinding upon the states, and the people of the states.The reasons, why it should be so deemed, will now besubmitted.^167. In the first place, the judicial power of theUnited States rightfully extending to all such cases,its judgment becomes ipso facto conclusive betweenthe parties before it, in respect to the points decided,unless some mode be pointed out by the constitution,in which that judgment may be revised. No suchmode is pointed out. Congress is vested with ampleauthority to provide for the exercise by the SupremeCourt of appellate jurisdiction from the decisions of allinferior tribunals, whether state or national, in caseswithin the purview of the judicial power of the UnitedStates ; but no mode is provided, by which any superiortribunal can re-examine, what the SupremeCourt has itself decided. Ours is emphatically a governmentof laws, and not of men ; and judicial decisionsof the highest tribunal, by the known course ofthe common law, are considered, as establishing thetrue construction of the laws, which are brought intocontroversy before it. The case is not alone consider.IV.] FINAL INTERPRETER. 127red as decided and settled ; but the principles of thedecision are held, as precedents and authority, to bindfuture cases of the same nature. This is the constantpractice under our whole system of jurisprudence.Our ancestors brought it with them, when they firstemigrated to this country ; and it is, and always hasbeen considered, as the great security of our rights,our liberties, and our property. It is on this account,that our law is justly deemed certain, and founded inpermanent principles, and not dependent upon the caprice,or will of particular judges. A more alarmingdoctrine could not be promulgated by any Americancourt, than that it was at liberty to disregard all formerrules and decisions, and to decide for itself, withoutreference to the settled course of antecedent principles.^ 168. This known course of proceeding, this settledhabit of thinking, this conclusive effect of judicial adjudications,was in the full view of the framers of the constitution.It was recognized, and enforced in everystate in the Union ; and a departure from it would havebeen justly deemed an approach to tyranny and arbitrarypower, to the exercise of mere discretion, and to theabandonment of all the just checks upon judicial authority.It would seem impossible, then, to presume, ifthe people intended to introduce a new rule in respectto the decisions of the Supreme Court, and to limit thenature and operations of their judgments in a mannerwholly unknown to the common law, and to our existingjurisprudence, that some indication of that intentionshould not be apparent on the face of the constitution.We find, (Art. 4.) that the constitution hasdeclared, that full faith and credit shall be given ineach state to the judicial proceedings of every other128 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.State. But no like provision has been made in respectto the judgments of the courts of the United States,because they were plainly supposed to be of paramountand absolute obligation throughout all the states. Ifthe judgments of the Supreme Court upon constitutionalquestions are conclusive and binding upon thecitizens at large, must they not be equally conclusiveupon the states ? If the states are parties to that instrument,are not the people of the states also parties ?§ 169. In the next place, as the judicial powerextends to all cases arising under the constitution,and that constitution is declared to be the supremelaw, that supremacy would naturally be construed toextend, not only over the citizens, but over the states.This, however, is not left to implication, for it is declaredto be the supreme law of the land, " anythingin the constitution or laws of any state to the contrarynotwithstanding." The people of any state cannot,then, by any alteration of their state constitution, destroy,or impair that supremacy. How, then, can theydo it in any other less direct manner ? Now, it is theproper function of the judicial department to interpretlaws, and by the very terms of the constitution to interpretthe supreme law. Its interpretation, then, becomesobligatory and conclusive upon all the departments ofthe federal government, and upon the whole people,so far as their rights and duties are derived from, oraffected by that constitution. If then all the departmentsof the national government may rightfully exerciseall the powers, which the judicial department has,by its interpretation, declared to be granted by the constitution; and are prohibited from exercising those,which are thus declared not to be granted by it, wouldit not be a solecism to hold, notwithstanding, that suchCH. IV.J FINAL INTERPRETER. 129rightful exercise should not be deemed the supremelaw of the land, and such prohibited powers shouldstill be deemed granted ? It would seem repugnantto the first notions of justice, that in respect to thesame instrument of government, different powers, andduties, and obligations should arise, and different rulesshould prevail, at the same time among the governed,from a right of interpreting the same words (manifestlyused in one sense only) in different, nay, in oppositesenses. If there ever was a case, in which uniformityof interpretation might well be deemed a necessarypostulate, it would seem to be that of a fundamentallaw of a government. It might otherwise follow, thatthe same individual, as a magistrate, might be boundby one rule, and in his private capacity by another, atthe very same moment.^ 170. There would be neither wisdom nor policyin such a doctrine ; and it would deliver over theconstitution to interminable doubts, founded uponthe fluctuating opinions and characters of those, whoshould, from time to time, be called to administer it.Such a constitution could, in no just sense, be deemeda law, much less a supreme or fundamental law. Itwould have none of the certainty or universality, whichare the proper attributes of such a sovereign rule. Itwould entail upon us all the miserable servitude, whichhas been deprecated, as the result of vague and uncertainjurisprudence. Miser a est servetus, uhi jus estvague aut interdum. It would subject us to constantdissensions, and perhaps to civil broils, from the perpetuallyrecurring conflicts upon constitutional questions.On the other hand, the worst, that could happen froma wrong decision of the judicial department, would be,that it might require the interposition of congress, or,Abr. IT130 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [boOK UI.in the last resort, of the amendatory power of the states,to redress the grievance.§ 171. We find the power to construe the constitutionexpressly confided to the judicial department,without any limitation or qualification, as to itsconclusiveness. Who, then, is at liberty, by generalimplications, not from the terms of the instrument, butfrom mere theory, and assumed reservations of sovereignright, to insert such a limitation or qualification ?We find, that to produce uniformity of interpretation,and to preserve the constitution, as a perpetual bondof union, a supreme arbiter or authority of construingis, if not absolutely indispensable, at least, of thehighest possible practical utility and importance.Who, then, is at liberty to reason down the terms ofthe constitution, so as to exclude their natural forceand operation ?^ 172. We find, that it is the known course ofthe judicial department of the several states to decidein the last resort upon all constitutional questionsarising in judgment ; and that this has always beenmaintained as a rightful exercise of authority, and conclusiveupon the whole state. As such, it has beenconstantly approved by the people, and never withdrawnfrom the courts by any amendment of their constitutions,when the people have been called to revisethem. We find, that the people of the several stateshave constantly relied upon this last judicial appeal,as the bulwark of their state rights and liberties ; andthat it is in perfect consonance with the whole structureof the jurisprudence of the common law. Undersuch circumstances, is it not most natural to presume,that the same rule was intended to be applied to theconstitution of the United States? And when werCH. IV.] FINAL INTERPRETER. 131find, that the judicial department of the United Statesis actually entrusted with a like power, is it not anirresistible presumption, that it had the same object,and was to have the same universally conclusive effect?Even under the confederation, an instrument framedwith infinitely more jealousy and deference for staterights, the judgment of the judicial department appointedto decide controversies between states wasdeclared to be final and conclusive ; and the appellatepower in other cases was held to overrule all statedecisions and state legislation.^ 173. If, then, reasoning from the terms of theconstitution, and the known principles of our jurisprudence,the appropriate conclusion is, that the judicialdepartment of the United States is, in the last resort,the final expositor of the constitution, as to all questionsof a judicial nature ; let us see, in the next place, howfar this reasoning acquires confirmation from the pasthistory of the constitution, and the practice under it.§ 174. That this view of the constitution was takenby its framers and friends, and was submitted to thepeople before its adoption, is positively certain. Thesame doctrine was constantly avowed in the stateconventions, called to ratify the constitution. Withsome persons it formed a strong objection to the constitution; with others it was deemed vital to its existenceand value. So, that it is indisputable, thatthe constitution was adopted under a full knowledgeof this exposition of the grant of power to the judicialdepartment.^ 175. This is not all. The constitution hasnow been in full operation more than forty years ; andduring this period the Supreme Court has constantly exercisedthis power of final interpretation in relation, not132 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.only to the constitution, and laws of the Union, but inrelation to state acts and state constitutions and laws,so far as they have affected the constitution, and laws,and treaties of the United States. Their decisions uponthese grave questions have never been repudiated, orimpaired by congress. No state has ever deliberately,or forcibly resisted the execution of the judgmentsfounded upon them ; and the highest state tribunalshave, jvith scarcely a single exception, acquiesced in,and, in most instances, assisted in executing them.During the same period, eleven states have been admittedinto the Union, under a full persuasion, that thesame power would be exerted over them. Many ofthe states have, at different times within the same period,been called upon to consider, and examine thegrounds, on which the doctrine has been maintained,at the solicitation of other states, which felt, that itoperated injuriously, or might operate injuriously upontheir interests. A great majority of the states,which have been thus called upon in their legislativecapacities to express opinions, have maintained thecorrectness of the doctrine, and the beneficial effectsof the power, as a bond of union, in terms of the mostunequivocal nature. Whenever any amendment hasbeen proposed to change the tribunal, and substituteanother common umpire or interpreter, it has rarelyreceived the concurrence of more than two or threestates, and has been uniformly rejected by a greatmajority, either silently, or by an express dissent.And instances have occurred, in which the legislatureof the same state has, at different times, avowed oppositeopinions, approving at one time, what it had denied,or at least questioned at another. So, that it may beasserted with entire confidence, that for forty yearsCH. IV. FINAL INTERPRETER. 133three fourths of all the states composing the Union haveexpressly assented to, or silently approved, this constructionof the constitution, and have resisted everyeffort to restrict, or alter it.^ 176. A weight of public opinion among the peoplefor such a period, uniformly thrown into one scaleso strongly, and so decisively, in the midst of all theextraordinary changes of parties, the events of peaceand of war, and the trying conflicts of public policyand state interests, is perhaps unexampled in the historyof all other free governments. 1 1 affords, as satisfactorya testimony in favor of the just and safeoperation of the system, as can well be imagined ; and,as a commentary upon the constitution itself, it is asabsolutely conclusive, as any ever can be, and affordsthe only escape from the occurrence of civil conflicts,and the delivery over of the subject to interminabledisputes.^ 177. In this review of the power of the judicialdepartment, upon a question of its supremacy in theinterpretation of the constitution, it has not been thoughtnecessary to rely on the deliberate judgments of thatdepartment in affirmance of it. But it may be properto add, that the judicial department has not only constantlyexercised this right of interpretation in the lastresort ; but its whole course of reasonings and operationshas proceeded upon the ground, that, once made,the interpretation was conclusive, as well upon thestates, as upon the people.134 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.CHAPTER V.RULES OF INTERPRETATION.^ 178. In our future commentaries upon the constitutionwe shall treat it, then, as it is denominatedin the instrument itself, as a constitution of government,ordained and established by the people of theUnited States for themselves and their posterity. Theyhave declared it the supreme law of the land. Theyhave made it a limited government. They have definedits authority. They have restrained it to the exerciseof certain powers, and reserved all others to thestates or to the people. It is a popular government. -Those, who administer it, are responsible to the people.It is as popular, and just as much emanating from thepeople, as the state governments. It is created for onepurpose ; the state governments for another. It maybealtered, and amended, and abolished at the will ofthe people. In short, it was made by the people,made for the people, and is responsible to the people.^ 179. In this view of the matter, let us now proceedto consider the rules, by which it ought to be interpreted;for if these rules are correctly laid down, it will saveus from many embarrassments in examining and definingits powers. Much of the difficulty, which has arisenin all the public discussions on this subject, has hadits origin in the want of some uniform rules of interpretation,expressly or tacitly agreed on by the disputants.Very different doctrines on this point have been adoptedby different commentators ; and not unfrequentlyvery different language held by the same parties atdifferent periods. In short, the rules of interpretationCH. v.] RULES OF INTERPRETATION. 135have often been shifted to suit the emergency ; and thepassions and prejudices of the day, or the favor andodium of a particular measure, have not unfrequentlyfurnished a mode of argument, which would, on theone hand, leave the constitution crippled and inanimate,or, on the other hand, give it an extent and elasticity,subversive of all rational boundaries.§ 180. Let us, then, endeavor to ascertain, whatare the true rules of interpretation applicable to theconstitution ; so that we may have some fixed stan fdard, by which to measure its powers, and limit itsprohibitions, and guard its obligations, and enforce itssecurities of our rights and liberties.§ 181. I. The first and fundamental rule in theinterpretation of all instruments is, to construe themaccording to the sense of the terms, and the intentionof the parties. Mr Justice Blackstone has remarked,that the intention of a law is to be gathered from thewords, the context, the subject-matter, the effects andconsequence, or the reason and spirit of the law. Hegoes on to justify the remark by stating, that words aregenerally to be understood in their usual and mostknown signification, not so much regarding the proprietyof grammar, as their general and popular use ;that if words happen to be dubious, their meaning maybeestablished by the context, or by comparing themwith other words and sentences in the same instrument; that illustrations may be further derived fromthe subject-matter, with reference to which the expressionsare used ; that the effect and consequence of aparticular construction is to be examined, because, ifa literal meaning would involve a manifest absurdity,it ought not to be adopted ; and that the reason andspirit of the law, or the causes, which led to its enactsCONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.ment, are often thebes exponents of the words, andlimit their application.^ 182. Where the words are plain and clear, andthe sense distinct and perfect arising on them, there isgenerally no necessity to have recourse to other meansof interpretation. It is only, when there is some ambiguityor doubt arising from other sources, that interpretationhas its proper office. There may be obscurity,as to the meaning, from the doubtful character ofthe words used, from other clauses in the same instrument,or from an incongruity or repugnancy betweenthe words, and the apparent intention derived from thewhole structure of the instrument, or its avowed object.In all such cases interpretation becomes indispensable.^ 183. II. In construing the constitution of theUnited States, we are, in the first instance, to consider,what are its nature and objects, its scope and design,as apparent from the structure of the instrument, viewedas a whole, and also viewed in its component parts.Where its words are plain, clear, and determinate,they require no interpretation ; and it should, therefore,be admitted, if al all, with great caution, and onlyfrom necessity, either to escape some absurd consequence,or to guard against some fatal evil. Wherethe words admit of two senses, each of which is conformableto common usage, that sense is to be adopted,which, without departing from the literal import ofthe words, best harmonizes with the nature and objects,the scope and design of the instrument. Where thewords are unambiguous, but the provision may covermore or less ground according to the intention, whichis yet subject to conjecture ; or where it may includein its general terms more or less, than might seemdictated by the general design, as that may be gatheredCH. v.] RULES OF INTERPRETATION. 137from other parts of the instrument, there is much moreroom for controversy ; and the argument from inconveniencewill probably have different influences upondifferent minds. Whenever such questions arise, theywill probably be settled, each upon its own peculiargrounds ; and whenever it is a question of power, itshould be approached with infinite caution, and affirmedonly upon the most persuasive reasons. In examiningthe constitution, the antecedent situation of thecountry, and its institutions, the existence and operationsof the state governments, the powers and operationsof the confederation, in short all the circumstances,which had a tendency to produce, or to obstructits formation and ratification, deserve a careful attention.Much, also, may be gathered from contemporaryhistory, and contemporary interpretation, to aidus in just conclusions.§ 184. Contemporary construction is properly resortedto, to illustrate, and confirm the text, to explain adoubtful phrase, or to expound an obscure clause ; andin proportion to the uniformity and universality ofthat construction, and the known ability and talentsof those, by whom it was given, is the credit, to whichit is entitled. It can never abrogate the text ; it cannever fritter away its obvious sense ; it can never narrowdown its limitations ; it can never enlarge its naturalboundaries.^ 185. And, after all, the most unexceptionablesource of collateral interpretation is from the practicalexpositions of the government itself in its various departmentsupon particular questions, discussed and settledupon their own single merits. These approachthe nearest in their own nature to judicial expositions;and have the same general recommendation, that bear.18138 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK Ut.longs to the latter. They are decided upon solemnargument, pro re naici, upon a doubt raised, upon a lismota, upon a deep sense of their importance and difficulty,in the face of the nation, with a view to presentaction, in the midst of jealous interests, and by mencapable of urging, or repelling the grounds of argument,from their exquisite genius, their comprehensive learning,or their deep meditation upon the absorbingtopic. How light, compared with these means ofinstruction, are the private lucubrations of the closet,or the retired speculations of ingenious minds, intenton theory, or general views, and unused to encountera practical difficulty at every step !§ 186. But to return to the rules of interpretation,arising ex directo from the text of the constitution.And first the rules to be drawn from the nature of theX instrument. (1.) It is to be construed, as a/ramc, orfundamental laid of government, established by thePEOPLE of the United States, according to their ownfree pleasure and sovereign will. In this respect it isin no wise distinguishable from the constitutions ofthe state governments. Each of them is established bythe people for their own purposes, and each is foundedon their supreme authority. The powers, which areconferred, the restrictions, which are imposed, theauthorities, which are exercised, the organization anddistribution thereof, which are provided, are in eachcase for the same object, the common benefit of thegoverned, and not for the profit or dignity of therulers.^ 187. If this be the true view of the subject, theconstitution of the United States is to receive as favorablea construction, as those of the states. Neither isto be construed alone; but each with a reference toCH. v.] RULES OF INTERPRETATION. 139the Other. Each belongs to the same system of government; each is limited in its powers ; and withinthe scope of its powers each is supreme. Each, by thetheory of our government, is essential to the existenceand due preservation of the powers and obligations ofthe other. The destruction of either would be equallycalamitous, since it would involve the ruin of thatbeautiful fabric of balanced government, which has beenreared with so much care and wisdom, and in whichthe people have reposed their confidence, as the truestsafeguard of their civil, religious, and political liberties.The exact limits of the powers, confided by thepeople to each, may not always be capable, from theinherent difficulty of the subject, of being defined, orascertained in all cases with perfect certainty. Butthe lines are generally marked out with sufficient broadnessand clearness ; and in the progress of the developmentof the peculiar functions of each, the part oftrue wisdom would seem to be, to leave in every practicabledirection a wide, if not an unmeasured, distancebetween the actual exercise of the sovereignty of each.In every complicated machine slight causes may disturbthe operations ; and it is often more easy to detectthe defects, than to apply a safe and adequate remedy.^ 1 88. IV. From the foregoing considerations wededuce the conclusion, that as a frame or fundamentallaw of government, (2.) The constitution of the UnitedStates is to receive a reasonable interpretation ofits language, and its powers, keeping in view the objectsand purposes, for which those powers were conferred.By a reasonable interpretation, we mean, thatin case the words are susceptible of two differentsenses, the one strict, the other more enlarged, thatshould be adopted, which is most consonant with the140 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.apparent objects and intent of the constitution ; thatwhich will give it efficacy and force, as a governmentrather than that, which will impair its operations, andreduce it to a state of imbecility. Of course we do notmean, that the words for this purpose are to be strainedbeyond their common and natural sense ; but keepingwithin that limit, the exposition is to have a fair andjust latitude, so as on the one hand to avoid obviousmischief, and on the other hand to promote the publicgood.^ 189. This consideration is of great importance inconstruing a frame of government ; and a fortiori aframe of government, the free and voluntary institutionof the people for their common benefit, security,and happiness. It is wholly unlike the case ofa municipal charter, or a private grant, in respect bothto its means and its ends. When a person makes aprivate grant of a particular thing, or of a license to doathing, or of an easement for the exclusive benefit ofthe grantee, we naturally confine the terms, howevergeneral, to the objects clearly in the view of the parties.But even in such cases, doubtful words, within thescope of those objects, are construed most favorablyfor the grantee ; because, though in derogation of therights of the grantor, they are promotive of the generalrights secured to the grantee. But, where the grantenures, solely and exclusively, for the benefit of thegrantor himself, no one would deny the propriety ofgiving to the words of the grant a benign and liberalinterpretation. In cases, however, of private grants,the objects generally are few ; they are certain ; theyare limited ; they neither require, nor look to a varietyof means or changes, which are to control, or modifyeither the end, or the means.rICH. v.] RULES OF Interpretation. 141^ 190. But a constitution of government, foundedby the people for themselves and their posterity, andfor objects of the most momentous nature, for perpetualunion, for the establishment of justice, for the generalwelfare, and for a perpetuation of the blessings of liberty,necessarily requires, that every interpretation ofits powers should have a constant reference to theseobjects. No interpretation of the words, in which thosepowers are granted, can be a sound one, which narrowsdown their ordinary import, so as to defeat those objects.That would be to destroy the spirit, and to cramp theletter. It has been justly observed, by the Supreme ^Court, that "the constitution unavoidably deals in generallanguage. It did not suit the purposes of the people,in framing this great charter of our liberties, to providefor minute specification of its powers, or to declarethe means, by which those powers should be carried intoexecution. It was foreseen, that it would be a perilous,and difficult, if not an impracticable task. The instrumentwas not intended to provide merely for the exigenciesof a few years ; but was to endure through along lapse of ages, the events of which were locked upin][the inscrutable purposes of Providence. It couldnot be foreseen, what new changes and modificationsof power might be indispensable to effectuate the generalobjects of the charter; and restrictions and specifications,which at the present might seem salutary,might in the end prove the overthrow of the systemitself. Hence its powers are expressed in generalterms, leaving the legislature, from time to time, toadopt its own means to effectuate legitimate objects,and to mould and model the exercise of its powers, asits own wisdom and the public interests should require."Language to the same effect will be found inother judgments of the same tribunal.142 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III§ 191. V. Where the power is granted in generalterms, the power is to be construed, as co-extensivewith the terms, unless some clear restriction upon itis deducible from the context. We do not mean toassert, that it is necessary, that such restriction shouldbe expressly found in the context. It will be sufficient,if it arise by necessary implication. But it is not sufficientto show, that there was, or might have been, asound or probable motive to restrict it. A restrictionfounded on conjecture is wholly inadmissible. Thereason is obvious : the text was adopted by the peoplein its obvious, and general sense. We have no meansof knowing, that any particular gloss, short of thissense, was either contemplated, or approved by thepeople ; and such a gloss might, though satisfactoryin one state, have been the very ground of objectionin another. It might have formed a motive to rejectit in one, and to adopt it in another. The sense of apart of the people has no title to be deemed the senseof the whole. Motives of state policy, or state interest,may properly have influence in the question ofratifying it ; but the constitution itself must be expounded,as it stands ; and not as that policy, or thatinterest may seem now to dictate. We are to construe,and not to frame the instrument.^ 1 92. VI. A power, given in general terms, is notto be restricted to particular cases, merely because itmay be susceptible of abuse, and, if abused, may leadto mischievous consequences. This argument is oftenused in public debate ; and in its common aspect addressesitself so much to popular fears and prejudices,that it insensibly acquires a weight in the public mind,to which it is no wise entitled. The argument ab inconvenientis sufficiently open to question, from theCH. v.] RULES OF INTERPRETATION. 143laxity of application, as well as of opinion, to which itleads. But the argument from a possible abuse of apower against its existence or use, is, in its nature, notonly perilous, but, in respect to governments, wouldshake their very foundation. Every form of governmentunavoidably includes a grant of some discretionarypowers. It would be wholly imbecile without them.t is impossible to foresee all the exigencies, whichlay arise in the progress of events, connected with therights, duties, and operations of a government. If theyI could be foreseen, it would be impossible ab ante toprovide for them. The means must be subject to perpetualmodification, and change ; they must be adaptedto the existing manners, habits, and institutions of;society, which are never stationary ; to the pressure ofDangers, or necessities ; to the ends in view ; to generaland permanent operations, as well as to fugitive;and extraordinary emergencies. In short, if the whole[society is not to be revolutionized at every critical period,and remodeled in every generation, there must be[left to those, who administer the government, a verylarge mass of discretionary powers, capable of greatertot less actual expansion according to circumstances,[and sufficiently flexible not to involve the nation inutter destruction from the rigid limitations imposedupon it by an improvident jealousy. Every power,however limited, as well as broad, is in its owen naturesusceptible of abuse. No constitution can provide perfectguards against it. Confidence must be reposedsome where ; and in free governments, the ordinarysecurities against abuse are found in the responsibilityof rulers to the people, and in the just exercise of theirelective franchise ; and ultimately in the sovereign powerof change belonging to them, in cases requiring CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.extraordinary remedies. Few cases are to be supposed,in which a power, however general, will be exertedfor the permanent oppression of the people. And yet,cases may easily be put, in which a limitation uponsuch a power might be found in practice to work mischief; to incite foreign aggression ; or encourage domesticdisorder. The power of taxation, for instance,may be carried to a ruinous excess ; and yet, a limitationupon that power might, in a given case, involvethe destruction of the independence of the country.^ 193. VII. On the other hand, a rule of equal importanceis, not to enlarge the construction of a givenpower beyond the fair scope of its terms, merely becausethe restriction is inconvenient, impolitic, or evenmischievous. If it be mischievous, the power of redressingthe evil lies with the people by an exercise ofthe power of amendment. If they do not choose toapply the remedy, it may fairly be presumed, that themischief is less than what would arise from a furtherextension of the power ; or that it is the least of two\ evils. Nor should it ever be lost sight of, that the governmentof the United States is one of limited and^ enumerated powers ; and that a departure from thetrue import and sense of its powers is, pro tanto, theestablishment of a new constitution. It is doing forthe people, what they have not chosen to do for themselves.It is usurping the functions of a legislator,and deserting those of an expounder of the law.Arguments drawn from impolicy or inconvenienceought here to be of no weight. The only soundprinciple is to declare, ita lex scripta est, to follow,and to obey. Nor, if a principle so just and conclusivecould be overlooked, could there well be found amore unsafe guide in practice, than mere policy andCH. v.] RULES OF INTERPRETATION. 145•convenience. Men on such subjects complexionalljdiffer from each other. The same men differ fromthemselves at different times. Temporary delusions,prejudices, excitements, and objects have irresistibleinfluence in mere questions of policy. And the policyof one age may ill suit the wishes, or the policy ofanother. The constitution is not to be subject to suchfluctuations. It is to have a fixed, uniform, permanentconstruction. It should be, so far at least as humaninfirmity will allov^^, not dependent upon the passionsor parties of particular times, but the same yesterday,to-day, and for ever.^ 194. VIII. No construction of a given power is tobe allowed, which plainly defeats, or impairs its avowedobjects. If, therefore, the words are fairly susceptibleof two interpretations, according to their commonsenseand use, the one of which would defeat one, orall of the objects, for which it was obviously given, andthe other of which would preserve and promote all, theformer interpretation ought to be rejected, and the latterbe held the true interpretation. This rule resultsfrom the dictates of mere common sense ; for everyinstrument ought to be so construed, ut magis valet,quin pereat. For instance, the constitution conferson congress the power to declare war. Now the worddeclare has several senses. It may mean to proclaim,or publish. But no person would imagine, that thiswas the whole sense, in which the word is used in thisconnexion. It should be interpreted in the sense, inwhich the phrase is used among nations, when appliedto such a subject matter. A power to declare war isa power to make, and carry on war. It is not a merepower to make known an existing thing, but to givelife and effect to the thing itself. The true doctrineMr 19146 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.has been expressed by the Supreme Court : *' If fromthe imperfection of human language there should beany serious doubts respecting the extent of any givenpower, the objects, for which it was given, especiallywhen those objects are expressed in the instrument itself,should have great influence in the construction."^ 195. IX. Where a power is remedial in its nature,there is much reason to contend, that it ought to beconstrued liberally. That was the doctrine of MrChief Justice Jay, in Chisholm v. Georgia ; and it isgenerally adopted in the interpretation of laws. Butthis liberality of exposition is clearly inadmissible, if itextends beyond the just and ordinary sense of theterms.^ 196. X. In the interpretation of a power, all theordinary and appropriate means to execute it are to bedeemed a part of the power itself. This results fromthe very nature and design of a constitution. In givingthe power, it does not intend to limit it to any onemode of exercising it, exclusive of all others. It mustbe obvious, (as has been already suggested,) that themeans of carrying into effect the objects of a powermay, nay, must be varied, in order to adapt themselvesto the exigencies of the nation at different times. Amode efficacious and useful in one age, or under oneposture of circumstances, may be wholly vain, or evenmischievous at another time. Government pre-supposesthe existence of a perpetual mutability in itsown operations on 'those, who are its subjects ; and aperpetual flexibility in adapting itself to their wants,their interests, their habits, their occupations, and theirinfirmities.^ 197. XI. And this leads us to remark, in the nextplace, that in the interpretation of the constitution there€H. v.] RULES OF INTERPRETATION. 147is no solid objection to implied powers. Had the facultiesof man been competent to the framing of a systemof government, which would leave nothing to implication,it cannot be doubted, that the effort wouldhave been made by the framers of our constitution.The fact, however, is otherwise. There is not in thewhole of that admirable instrument a grant of powers,which does not draw after it others, not expressed, butvital to their exercise ; not substantive and independent,indeed, but auxiliary and subordinate. There isno phrase in it, which, like the articles of confederation,excludes incidental and implied powers, and whichrequires, that every thing granted shall be expresslyand minutely described. Even the tenth amendment,which was framed for the purpose of quieting the excessivejealousies, which had been excited, omits theword "expressly," (which was contained in the articlesof confederation,) and declares only, that "the powers,not delegated to the United States, nor prohibited byit to the states, are reserved to the states respectively,or to the people ;" thus leaving the question, whetherthe particular power, which may become the subjectof contest, has been delegated to the one government,or prohibited to the other, to depend upon a fair constructionof the whole instrument. The men, whodrew and adopted this amendment, had experiencedthe embarrassments, resulting from the insertion of thisword in the articles of confederation, and probablyomitted it to avoid those embarrassments. A constitution,to contain an accurate detail of all the subdivisions,of which its great powers will admit, and ofall the means, by which these may be carried into execution,would partake of the prolixity of a legal code,and could scarcely be embraced by the human mind.148 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK UKIt would probably never be understood by the public.Its nature, therefore, requires, that only its great outlinesshould be marked, its important objects designated,and the minor ingredients, which compose thoseobjects, be deduced from the nature of those objectsthemselves. That this idea was entertained by theframers of the American constitution, is not only tobe inferred from the nature of the instrument, but fromthe language. Why, else, were some of the limitations,found in the ninth section of the first article, introduced? It is also, in some degree, warranted, bytheir having omitted to use any restrictive term, whichmight prevent its receiving a fair and just interpretation.In considering this point, we should never forget,that it is a constitution we are expounding.^ 198. XII. Another point, in regard to the interpretationof the constitution, requires us to advert tothe rules applicable to cases of concurrent and exclusivepowers. In what cases are the powers given to thegeneral government exclusive, and in what cases maythe states maintain a concurrent exercise ? Upon thissubject we have an elaborate exposition by the authorsof the Federalist ; and as it involves some of the mostdelicate questions growing out of the constitution, andthose, in which a conflict with the states is most likelyto arise, we cannot do better than to quote the reasoning.^ 199. "An entire consolidation of the states intoone complete national sovereignty, would imply an entiresubordination of the parts ; and whatever powersmight remain in them, would be altogether dependenton the general will. But as the plan of the conventionaims only at a partial union or consolidation, the stategovernments would clearly retain all the rights of sove-CH. v.] RULES OF INTERPRETATION. 149reign, which they before had, and which were not,by that act, exclusively delegated to the United States.This exclusive delegation, or rather this alienation ofstate sovereignty, would only exist in three cases :where the constitution in express terms granted an exclusiveauthority to the Union ; where it granted, inone instance, an authority to the Union, and in another,prohibited the states from exercising the like authority ;and where it granted an authority to the Union, towhich a similar authority in the states would be absolutelyand totally contradictory and repugnant, I usethese terms to distinguish this last case from another,which might appear to resemble it ; but which would,in fact, be essentially different : I mean, where theexercise of a concurrent jurisdiction might be productiveof occasional interferences in the policy of anybranch of administration, but would not imply any directcontradiction or repugnancy in point of constitutionalauthority. These three cases of exclusive jurisdictionin the federal government, may be exemplifiedby the following instances. The last clause but onein the eighth section of the first article, provides expressly,that congress shall exercise ' exclusive legislation' over the district to be appropriated as the seatof government. This answers to the first case. Thefirst clause of the same section empowers congressto lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises ;'and the second clause of the tenth section of the samearticle declares, that ' no state shall, without the consentof congress, lay any imposts or duties on importsor exports, except for the purpose of executing itsinspection laws.' Hence would result an exclusivepower in the Union to lay duties on imports and exports,with the particular exception mentioned. But150 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III,this power is abridged by another clause, which declares,that no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exportedfrom any state ; in consequence of which qualification,it now only extends to the duties on imports.This answers to the second case. The third will befound in that clause, which declares, that congressI shall have power ' to establish an uniform rule ofj naturalization throughout the United States.' Thismust necessarily be exclusive ; because, if each stateshad power to prescribe a distinct rule, there could beno uniform rules The correctness of these rules ofinterpretation has never been controverted ; and theyhave been often recognised by the Supreme Court.§ 200. The two first rules are so completely self-evident,that every attempt to illustrate them would bevain, if it had not a tendency to perplex and confuse.The last rule, viz. that which declares, that the poweris exclusive in the national government, where an authorityis granted to the Union, to which a similarauthority in the states would be absolutely and totallycontradictory and repugnant, is that alone, which maybethought to require comment. This rule seems, inits own nature, as little susceptible of doubt, as theothers, in reference to the constitution. For, since theconstitution has declared, that the constitution andlaws, and treaties in pursuance of it shall be the supremelaw of the land ; it would be absurd to say,that a state law, repugnant to it, might have concurrentoperation and validity ; and especially, as it isexpressly added, anything in the constitution or lawsof any state to the contrary notwithstanding. Therepugnancy, then, being made out, it follows, that thestate law is just as much void, as though it had beenexpressly declared to be void ; or the power in conch.v.] RULES OF INTERPRETATION. 151dress had been expressly declared to be exclusive.Every power given to congress is by the constitutionnecessarily supreme ; and if, from its nature, or fromthe words of the grant, it is apparently intended to beexclusive, it is as much so, as if the states were expresslyforbidden to exercise it.^ 201. And this leads us to remark, that in the exerciseof concurrent powers, if there be a conflict betweenthe laws of the Union and the laws of the states,the former being supreme, the latter must of courseyield. The possibility, nay the probability, of such aconflict was foreseen by the framers of the constitution,and was accordingly expressly provided for. If a statepasses a law inconsistent with the constitution of theUnited States it is a mere nullity. If it passes a lawclearly within its own constitutional powers, still if itconflicts with the exercise of a power given to congress,to the extent of the interference its operation is suspended; for in a conflict of laws, that which is suprememust govern. Therefore, it has often been adjudged,that if a state law is in conflict with a treaty,or an act of congress, it becomes ipso facto inoperativeto the extent of the conflict.^ 202. From this great rule, that the constitutionand law s, made in pursuance thereof, are supreme ;and that they control the constitutions and laws of thestates, and cannot be controlled by them, from this,which may be deemed an axiom, other auxiliary corol ^ladies may be deduced. In the first place, that, if apower is given to create a thing, it implies a powerto preserve it. Secondly, that a power to destroy, ifwielded by a different hand, is hostile to, and incompatiblewith this power to create and preserve.Thirdly, that where this repugnancy exists, the CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.thirty, which is supreme, must control, and not yieldto that, over which it is supreme. Consequently, theinferior power becomes a nullity.§ 203. But a question of a still more delicate naturemay arise ; and that is, how far in the exercise of aconcurrent power, the actual legislation of congress supersedesthe state legislation, or suspends its operationover the subject matter. Are the state laws inoperativeonly to the extent of the actual conflict ; or doesthe legislation of congress suspend the legislative powerof the states over the subject matter ? To such aninquiry, probably, no universal answer could be given.It may depend upon the nature of the power, the effectof the actual exercise, and the extent of the subjectmatter.^ 204. It has been sometimes argued, that when apower is granted to congress to legislate in specificcases, for purposes growing out of the Union, the naturalconclusion is, that the power is. designed to beexclusive ; that the power is to be exercised for thegood of the whole, by the will of the whole, and consistentlywith the interests of the whole ; and that theseobjects can no where be so clearly seen, or so thoroughlyweighed, as in congress, where the whole nationis represented. But the argument proves toomuch ; and pursued to its full extent, it would establish,that all the powers granted to congress are exclusive,unless where concurrent authority is expressly reservedto the states. For instance, upon this reasoning thepower of taxation in congress would annul the wholepower of taxation of the states ; and thus operate a virtualdissolution of their sovereignty. Such a pretensionhas been constantly disclaimed.CH. v.] RULES OF INTERPRETATION. 153^ 205. On the other hand, it has been maintainedwith great pertinacity, that the states possess concurrentauthority with congress in all cases, where the poweris not expressly declared to be exclusive, or expresslyprohibited to the states ; and if, in the exercise of aconcurrent power, a conflict arises, there is no reason,why each should not be deemed equally rightful. Butit is plain, that this reasoning goes to the direct overthrowof the principle of supremacy ; and, if admitted,it would enable the subordinate sovereignty to annulthe powers of the superior. There is a plain repugnancein conferring on one government a power to controlthe constitutional measures of another, which other,with respect to these very measures, is declared to besupreme over that, which exerts the control. For instance,the states have acknowledged a concurrentpower of taxation. But it is wholly inadmissible toallow that power to be exerted over any instrumentemployed by the general government to execute itsown powers ; for such a power to tax involves a powerto destroy ; and this power to destroy may defeat,and render useless the power to create. Thus, a statemay not tax the mail, the mint, patent rights, customhousepapers, or judicial process of the courts of theUnited States. And yet there is no clause in the constitution,which prohibits the states from exercisingthe power ; nor any exclusive grant to the UnitedStates. The apparent repugnancy creates, by implication,the prohibition.^ 206. In considering, then, this subject, it would beimpracticable to lay down any universal rule, as towhat powers are, by implication, exclusive in the generalgovernment, or concurrent in the states ; and inrelation to the latter, what restrictions either on theAhr. 20154 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.power itself, or on the actual exercise of the power,arise by implication. In some cases, as we have seen,there may exist a concurrent power, and yet restrictionsupon it must exist in regard to objects. In othercases, the actual operations of the power only are suspendedor controlled, when there arises a conflict withthe actual operations of the Union. Every question ofthis sort must be decided by itself upon its own circumstancesand reasons. Because the power to regulatecommerce, from its nature and objects, is exclusive, itdoes not follow, that the power to pass bankrupt lawsalso is exclusive.^ 207. XIII. Another rule of interpretation deservesconsideration in regard to the constitution. There arecertain maxims, which have found their way, not onlyinto judicial discussions, but into the business of commonlife, as founded in common sense, and commonconvenience. Thus, it is often said, that in an instrumenta specification of particulars is an exclusion ofgenerals ; or the expression of one thing is the exclusionof another. Lord Bacon's remark, " that, as exceptionstrengthens the force of a law in cases not excepted,so enumeration weakens it in cases not enumerated,"has been perpetually referred to, as a fine illustration.These maxims, rightly understood, and rightlyapplied, undoubtedly furnish safe guides to assist us inthe task of exposition. But they are susceptible of beingapplied, and indeed are often ingeniously applied,to the subversion of the text, and the objects of theinstrument. Thus, it has been suggested, that anaffirmative provision in a particular case excludes theexistence of the like provision in every other case ;and a negative provision in a particular case admitsthe existence of the same form in every other case.CH. v.] RULES OF INTERPRETATION. 155Both of these deductions are, or rather may be, unfoundedin solid reasoning. Thus, it was objected tothe constitution, that, having provided for the trial byjury in criminal cases, there was an implied exclusionof it in civil cases. As if there was not an essentialdifference between silence and abolition, between apositive adoption of it in one class of cases, and a discretionaryright (it being clearly within the reach ofthe judicial power confided to the Union) to adopt,or reject it in all or any other cases. One might withjust as much propriety hold, that, because congresshave power " to declare war," but no power is expresslygiven to make peace, the latter is excluded ; or that,because it is declared, that " no bill of attainder, orex post facto law shall be passed " by congress, thereforecongress possess in all other cases the right topass any laws. The truth is, that in order to ascertain,how far an affirmative or negative provision excludes,or implies others, we must look to the natureof the provision, the subject matter, the objects, and thescope of the instrument. These, and these only, canproperly determine the rule of construction. Therecan be no doubt, that an affirmative grant of powersin many cases will imply an exclusion of all others.As, for instance, the constitution declares, that thepowers of congress shall extend to certain enumeratedcases. This specification of particulars evidently excludesall pretensions to a general legislative authority.Why ? Because an affirmative grant of special powerswould be absurd, as well as useless, if a general authoritywere intended. In relation, then, to such asubject as a constitution, the natural and obvious senseof its provisions, apart from any technical or artificialrules, is the true criterion of construction.^>ml156 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.§ 208. XIV. Another rule of interpretation of the^- constitution, suggested bj the foregoing, is, that thenatural import of a single clause is not to be narrowed,so as to exclude implied powers resulting from itscharacter, simply because there is another clause,which enumerates certain powers, which might otherwisebe deemed implied powers within its scope ; forin such cases we are not, as a matter of course, to assume,that the affirmative specification excludes allother implications. This rule has been put in a clearand just light by one of our most distinguished statesmen; and his illustration will be more satisfactory,perhaps, than any other, which can be offered. *' Theconstitution," says he, " vests in congress, expressly,the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, andexcises, and the power to regulate trade. That theformer power, if not particularly expressed, wouldhave been included in the latter, as one of the objectsof a general power to regulate trade, is not necessarilyimpugned by its being so expressed. Examples ofthis sort cannot sometimes be easily avoided, and areto be seen elsewhere in the constitution. Thus, thepower * to define and punish offences against the lawof nations ' includes the power, afterwards particularlyexpressed, ' to make rules concerning captures,' &:c.from offending neutrals. So, also, a power ' to coinmoney ' would, doubtless, include that of ' regulatingits value,' had not the latter power been expressly inserted.The term taxes, if standing alone, would certainlyhave included * duties, imposts, and excises.'In another clause it is said, * no tax or duty shall belaid on exports.' Here the two terms are used assynonymous. And in another clause, where it is said« no state shall lay any imposts or duties,' &c. theCH. v.] RULES OF INTERPRETATION. 157terms imposts and duties are synonymous. Pleonasms,tautologies, and the promiscuous use of terms and ^"8^phrases, differing in their shades of meaning, (alwaysto be expounded with reference to the context, andunder the control of the general character and scopeof the instrument, in which they are found,) are to beascribed, sometimes to the purposes of greater caution,sometimes to the imperfection of language, and sometimesto the imperfection of man himself. In thisview of the subject it was quite natural, however certainlythe power to regulate trade might include apower to impose duties on it, not to omit it in a clauseenumerating the several modes of revenue authorizedby the construction. In few cases could the rule,ex major cautela, occur with more claim to respect."^ 209. We may close this view of some of the moreimportant rules to be employed in the interpretationof the constitution, by adverting to a few belonging tomere verbal criticism, which are indeed but corollariesfrom what has been said, and have been already alludedto ; but which, at the same time, it may be of someuse again distinctly to enunciate.^210. XV. In the first place, then, every wordemployed in the constitution is to be expounded in itsplain, obvious, and common sense, unless the contextfurnishes some ground lo control, qualify, or enlargeit. Constitutions are not designed for metaphysicalor logical subtleties, for niceties of expression, forcritical propriety, for elaborate shades of meaning, orfor the exercise of philosophical acuteness, or juridicalresearch. They are instruments of a practical nature,founded on the common business of human life, adaptedto common wants, designed for common use, andfitted for common understandings. The people make158 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.them ; the people adopt them ; the people must besupposed to read them, with the help of common sense;and cannot be presumed to admit in them any reconditemeaning, or any extraordinary gloss.^ 21 1. XVI. But, in the next place, words, from thenecessary imperfection of all human language, acquiredifferent shades of meaning, each of which is equallyappropriate, and equally legitimate ; each of which recedesin a wider or narrower degree from the others,according to circumstances ; and each of which receivesfrom its general use some indefiniteness and obscurity,as to its exact boundary and extent. We are,indeed, often driven to multiply commentaries from thevagueness of words in themselves ; and perhaps stillmore often from the different manner, in which differentminds are accustomed to employ them. They expandor contract, not only from the conventional modificationsintroduced by the changes of society ; but alsofrom the more loose or more exact uses, to which mendifferent talents, acquirements, and tastes, from choiceor necessity apply them. No person can fail to remarkthe gradual deflections in the meaning of words fromone age to another ; and so constantly is this processgoing on, that the daily language of life in one generationsometimes requires the aid of a glossary in another.It has been justly remarked, that no language is so copious,as to supply words and phrases for every complexidea ; or so correct, as not to include many, equivocallydenoting different ideas. Hence it must happen,that however accurately objects may be discriminatedin themselves, and however accurately the discriminationmay be considered, the definition of them may berendered inaccurate by the inaccuracy of the terms, inwhich it is delivered. We must resort then to theCH. v.] RULES OF INTERPRETATION. 159context, and shape the particular meaning, so as tomake it fit that of the connecting words, and agreewith the subject matter.§ 212. XVII. In the next place, where technicalwords are used, the technical meaning is to be appliedto them, unless it is repelled by the context. But thesame word often possesses a technical, and a commonsense.In such a case the latter is to be preferred,unless some attendant circumstance points clearly tothe former. No one would doubt, when the constitutionhas declared, that " the privilege of the writ ofhabeas corpus shall not be suspended," unless underpeculiar circumstances, that it referred, not to everysort of writ, which has acquired that name ; but tothat, which has been emphatically so called, on accountof its remedial power to free a party from arbitraryimprisonment. So, again, when it declares, that insuits at common laid, &c. the right of trial by jury shallbe preserved, though the phrase "common law " admitsof different meanings, no one can doubt, that it is usedin a technical sense. When, again, it declares, thatcongress shall have power to provide a navy, we readilycomprehend, that authority is given to construct,prepare, or in any other manner to obtain a navy. Butwhen congress is further authorized to provide for callingforth the militia, we perceive at once, that theword " provide " is used in a somewhat different sense.^ 213. XVIII. And this leads us to remark, in thenext place, that it is by no means a correct rule ofinterpretation to construe the same word in the samesense, wherever it occurs in the same instrument. Itdoes not follow, either logically or grammatically, thatbecause a word is found in one connexion in the constitution,with a definite sense, therefore the same160 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.sense is to be adopted in every other connexion, inwhich it occurs. This would be to suppose, that theframers weighed only the force of single words, as philologistsor critics, and not whole clauses and objects,as statesmen and practical reasoners. And yet nothinghas been more common than to subject the constitutionto this narrow and mischievous criticism.Men of ingenious and subtle minds, who seek forsymmetry and harmony in language, having found inthe constitution a word used in some sense, whichfalls in with their favourite theory of interpreting it,have made that the standard, by which to measure itsuse in every other part of the instrument. They havethus stretched it, as it were, on the bed of Procrustes,lopping off its meaning, when it seemed too large fortheir purposes, and extending it, when it seemed tooshort. They have thus distorted it to the most unnaturalshapes, and crippled, where they have sought onlyto adjust its proportions according to their own opinions.It was very justly observed by the SupremeCourt, " that the same words have not necessarily thesame meaning attached to them, when found in differentparts of the same instrument. Their meaningis controlled by the context. This is undoubtedlytrue. In common language, the same word has variousmeanings ; and the peculiar sense, in which itis used in any sentence, is to be determined by thecontext." A very easy example of this sort willbe found in the use of the word "establish," which isfound in various places in the constitution. Thus,in the preamble, one object of the constitution isavowed to be "to establish justice," which seemshere to mean to settle firmly, to fix unalterably, orrather, perhaps, as justice, abstractedly considered.CH. v.] RULES OF INTERPRETATION. 161must be considered as for ever fixed and unalterable, todispense or administer justice. Again, the constitutiondeclares, that congress shall have power " to establishan uniform rule of naturalization, and uniform laws onthe subject of bankruptcies," where it is manifestly-usedas equivalent to make, or form, and not to fix orsettle unalterably and forever. Again, " congress shallhave power to establish post-offices and post-roads,"where the appropriate sense would seem to be to create,to found, and to regulate, not so much with a viewto permanence of form, as to convenience of action.Again, it is declared, that " congress shall make no lawrespecting an establishment of religion," which seemsto prohibit any laws, which shall recognise, found, confirm,or patronize any particular religion, or form of religion,whether permanent or temporary, whetheralready existing, or to arise in future. In this clause,establishment seems equivalent in meaning to settlement,recognition, or support. And again, in the preamble,it is said, " We, the people, &c. do ordain andestablish this constitution," &c. where the most appropriatesense seems to be to create, to ratify, and to confirm.So, the word " state " will be found used in theconstitution in all the various senses, to which it is commonlyapplied. It sometimes means, the separate sectionsof territory occupied by the political societieswithin each ; sometimes the particular governmentsestablished by these societies ; sometimes these societiesas organized into these particular governments ;and lastly, sometimes the people composing these politicalsocieties in their highest sovereign capacity.§ 214. XIX. But the most important rule, in casesof this nature, is, that a constitution of governmentdoes not, and cannot, from its nature, depend in anyAbr. 21162 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.great degree upon mere verbal criticism, or upon theimport of single words. Such criticism may not bewholly without use ; it may sometimes illustrate, orunfold the appropriate sense ; but unless it stands wellwith the context and subject-matter, it must yield tothe latter. While, then, we may well resort to themeaning of single words to assist our inquiries, weshould never forget, that it is an instrument of governmentwe are to construe ; and, as has been alreadystated, that must be the truest exposition, which bestharmonizes with its design, its objects, and its generalstructure.§ 215. The remark of Mr. Burke may, with a veryslight change of phrase, be addressed as an admonitionto all those, who are called upon to frame, or to interpreta constitution. Government is a practical thingmade for the happiness of mankind, and not to furnishout a spectacle of uniformity to gratify the schemes olvisionary politicians. The business of those, who arecalled to administer it, is to rule, and not to wrangle.It would be a poor compensation, that we had triumphedin a dispute, whilst we had lost an empire ;that we had frittered down a power, and at the sametime had destroyed the republic.CH. VI.] THE PREAMBLE. 163CHAPTER VLTHE PREAMBLE.§ 216. Having disposed of these preliminary inquiries,we are now arrived at that part of our labours,which involves a commentary upon the actual provisionsof the constitution of the United States. It isproposed generally to take up the successive clauses inthe order in which they stand in the instrument itself,so that the exposition may naturally flow from the termsof the text.§ 217. We begin then with the preamble of theconstitution. It is in the following words :"We, the people of the United States, in orderto form a more perfect union, establish justice, insuredomestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence,promote the general welfare, and secure the blessingsof liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain andestablish this constitution for the United States ofAmerica."^ 218. The importance of examining the preamble,for the purpose of expounding the language of a statute,has been long felt, and universally conceded in alljuridical discussions. It is an admitted maxim in theordinary course of the administration of justice, thatthe preamble of a statute is a key to open the mind ofthe makers, as to the mischiefs, which are to be remedied,and the objects, which are to be accomplished bythe provisions of the statute. We find it laid down insome of our earliest authorities in the common law ;and civilians are accustomed to a similar expression,cessante legis gremio, cessat et ipsa lex.164 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.§ 219. There does not seem any reason, why, in afundamental law or constitution of government, anequal attention should not be given to the intention ofthe framers, as stated in the preamble. And accordinglywe find, that it has been constantly referred tobystatesmen and jurists to aid them in the expositionof its provisions.§ 220. The language of the preamble of the constitutionwas probably in a good measure drawn fromthat of the third article of the confederation, which declares,that "The said states hereby severally enterinto a firm league of friendship with each other, fortheir common defence, the security of their liberties,and their mutual and general welfare." And we accordinglyfind, that the first resolution offered in the convention,which framed the constitution, was, that thearticles of the confederation ought to be so correctedand enlarged, as to accomplish the objects proposedby their institution, namely, common, defence, securityof liberty, and general welfare.^ 221. And, here, we must guard ourselves againstan error, which is too often allowed to creep into thediscussions upon this subject. The preamble nevercan be resorted to, to enlarge the powers confided tothe general government, or any of its departments. Itcannot confer any power per se ; it can never amount,by implication, to an enlargement of any power expresslygiven. It can never be the legitimate source of anyimplied power, when otherwise withdrawn from theconstitution. Its true office is to expound the nature,and extent, and application of the powers actually conferredby the constitution, and not substantively tocreate them. For example, the preamble declares oneobject to be, " to provide for the common defence."CH. VI.] THE PREAMBLE. 165jk No one can doubt, that this does not enlarge the power of congress to pass any measures, which they mayw- deem useful for the common defence. But, suppose theI terms of a given power admit of two constructions, theone more restrictive, the other more Liberal, and eachof them is consistent with the words, but is, and oughtto be, governed by the intent of the power ; if onewould promote, and the other defeat the common defence,ought not the former, upon the soundest principepies of interpretation to be adopted? Are we at liberty,upon any principles of reason, or common sense, toadopt a restrictive meaning, which will defeat an avowedobject of the constitution, when another equallynatural, and more appropriate to the object, is before us?Would not this be to destroy an instrument by a measureof its words, which that instrument itself repudiates?^ 222. The constitution having been in operationmore than forty years, and being generally approved, itmay, at first sight, seem unnecessary to enter upon anyexamination of the manner and extent, to which it iscalculated to accomplish the objects proposed in thepreamble, or the importance of those objects, not merelyto the whole, in a national view, but also to the individualstates. Attempts have, however, been made atdifferent times, in different parts of the Union, to stirup a disaffection to the theory, as well as to the actualexercise of the powers of the general government ; todoubt its advantages ; to exaggerate the unavoidableinequalities of its operations ; to accustom the minds ofthe people to contemplate the consequences of a division,as fraught with no dangerous evils ; and thus tolead the way, if not designedly, at least insensibly, to aseparation, as involving no necessary sacrifice of importCONSTITUTION OF The. STATES. [bOOK III.tant blessings, or principles, and, on the whole, undersome circumstances, as not undesirable, or improbable.§ 223. It is easy to see, how many different, and evenopposite motives may, in different parts of the Union, atdifferent times, give rise to, and encourage such speculations.Political passions and prejudices, the disappointmentsof personal ambition, the excitements andmortifications of party strife, the struggles for particularsystems and measures, the interests, jealousies, andrivalries of particular states, the unequal local pressureof a particular system of policy, either temporary orpermanent, the honest zeal of mere theorists and enthusiastsin relation to government, the real or imaginarydread of a national consolidation, the decisive and corruptprojects of mere demagogues ; these, and manyother influences of more or less purity and extent, may,and we almost fear, must, among a free people, open toargument, and eager for discussion, and anxious for amore perfect organization of society, for ever preservethe elements of doubt and discord, arid bring into inquiryamong many minds, the question of the value of theUnion.^ 224. Under these circumstances it may not bewithout some use to condense, in an abridged form,some of those reasons, which became, with reflectingminds, the solid foundation, on which the adoption ofthe constitution was originally rested, and which, beingpermanent in their nature, ought to secure its perpetuity,as the sheet anchor of our political hopes.^ 225. The constitution, then, was adopted, first " toform a more perfect union." Why this was desirablehas been in some measure anticipated in consideringthe defects of the confederation. When the constitution,however, was before the people for ratification,CH. VI.] THE PREAMBLE. 167suggestions were frequently made by those, who wereopposed to it, that the country was too extensive for asingle national government, and ought to be broken upinto several distinct confederacies, or sovereignties ; andsome even went so far, as to doubt, whether it was not,on the whole, best, that each state should retain a separate,independent, and sovereign political existence.Those, who contemplated several confederacies, speculatedupon a dismemberment into three great confederacies,one of the northern, another of the middle, anda third of the southern states. The greater probability,certainly, then was of a separation into two confederacies; the one composed of the northern and middlestates, and the other of the southern. The reasoningof the Federalist on this subject seems absolutely irresistible.The progress of the population in the westernterritory since that period has materially changedthe basis of all that reasoning. There could scarcelynow exist, upon any dismemberment with a view tolocal interests, poUtical associations, or public safety,less than three confederacies, and most probably four.And it is more than probable, that the line of divisionwould be traced out by geographical boundaries, whichwould separate the slave-holding from the non-slaveholdersstates. Such a distinction in government is sofraught with causes of irritation and alarm, that no honestpatriot could contemplate it without many painfuland distressing fears.^ 226. But the material consideration, which shouldbe kept steadily in view, is, that under such circumstancesa national government, clothed with powers atleast equally extensive with those given by the constitution,would be indispensable for the preservation ofeach separate confederacy. Nay, it cannot be doubted,168 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.that much larger powers, and much heavier expenditureswould be necessary. No nation could long maintainits public liberties, surrounded by powerful andvigilant neighbours, unless it possessed a governmentclothed with powers of great efficiency, prompt to act,and able to repel every invasion of its rights. Norwould it afford the slightest security, that all the confederacieswere composed of a people descended fromthe same ancestors, speaking the same language, professingthe same religion, attached to the same principlesof government, and possessing similar manners,habits, and customs. If it be true, that these circumstanceswould not be sufficient to hold them in a bondof peace and union, when forming one government, actingfor the interests, and as the representatives of therights of the whole ; how could a better fate be expected,when the interests and the representation wereseparate; and ambition, and local interests, and feelings,and peculiarities of climate, and products, and institutions,and imaginary or real aggressions and grievances,and the rivalries of commerce, and the jealousies ofdominion, should spread themselves over the distinctcouncils, which would regulate their concerns by independentlegislation? The experience of the wholeworld is against any reliance for security and peace betweenneighbouring nations, under such circumstances.The Abbe Manly has forcibly stated in a single passagethe whole result of human experience on this subject." Neighbouring states," says he, " are naturallyenemies of each other, unless their common weaknessforces them to league in a confederate republic ; andtheir constitution prevents the differences, that neighbourhoodoccasions, extinguishing that secret jealousy,which disposes all states to aggrandize themselves atCH. VI.] THE PREAMBLE* 169the expense of their neighbours." This passage, ashas been truly observed, at the same time points outthe evils, and suggests the remedy.§ 227. The same reasoning would apply with augmentedforce to the case of a dismemberment, wheneach state should by itself constitute a nation. Thevery inequalities in the size, the revenues, the population,the products, the interests, and even in the institutionsand laws of each, would occasion a perpetualpetty warfare of legislation, of border aggressions andviolations, and of political and personal animosities,which, first or last, would terminate in the subjugationof the weaker to the arms of the stronger. In our furtherobservations on this subject, it is not proposedto distinguish the case of several confederacies fromthat of a complete separation of all the states ; as in ageneral sense the remarks apply with irresistible, if notwith uniform, force to each,§ 228. Does, then, the extent of our territory offerany solid objection against forming " this more perfectunion ? " This question, so far as respects the originalterritory included within the boundaries of the UnitedStates by treaty of peace of 1783, seems almost settledby the experience of the last forty years. It is nolonger a matter of conjecture, how far the governmentis capable (all other things being equal) of beingpractically applied to the whole of that territory. Thedistance between the utmost limits of our present population,and the diversity of interests among the whole,seem to have presented no obstacles under the beneficentadministration of the general government, to themost perfect harmony and general advancement of all.Perhaps it has been demonstrated, (so far as our limitedexperience goes,) that the increased facilities of interior.22170 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.course, the uniformity of regulations and laws, the commonprotection, the mutual sacrifices of local interests,when incompatible with that of the nation, and the prideand confidence in a government, in which all are represented,and all are equal in rights and privileges ; perhaps,we say, it has been demonstrated, that these effectsof the Union have promoted, in a higher degree, the prosperityof every state, than could have been attained byany single state, standing alone, in the freest exerciseof all its intelligence, its resources, and its institutions,without any check or obstruction during the same period.The great change, which has been made in ourinternal condition, as w^ell as in our territorial power, bythe acquisition of Louisiana and Florida, have, indeed,given rise to many serious reflections, whether such anexpansion of our empire may not hereafter endangerthe original system. But time alone can solve this question; and to time it is the part of wisdom and patriotismto leave it.^ 229. The union of these states, " the more perfectunion " is, then, and must for ever be invaluable to all,in respect both to foreign and domestic concerns. Itwill prevent some of the causes of war, that scourge ofthe human race, by enabling the general government,not only to negotiate suitable treaties for the protectionof the rights and interests of all, but by compelling ageneral obedience to them, and a general respect forthe obligations of the law of nations. It is notorious,that even under the confederation, the obligations oftreaty stipulations were openly violated, or silently disregarded; and the peace of the whole confederacy wasat the mercy of the majority of any single state. Ifthe states were separated, they would, or might, formseparate and independent treaties with different nations,CH. VI.] THE PREAMBLE. 171according to their peculiar interests. These treatieswould, or might, involve jealousies and rivalries athome, as well as abroad, and introduce conflicts betweennations struggling for a monopoly of the tradeof each state. Retaliatory or evasive stipulationswould be made, to counteract the injurious system of aneighbouring or distant state, and thus the scene beagain acted over with renewed violence, which succeededthe peace of 1 783, when the common interestswere forgotten in the general struggle for superiority.It would manifestly be the interest of foreign nations topromote these animosities and jealousies, that in thegeneral weakness the states might seek their protectionby an undue sacrifice of their own interests, or fallan easy prey to their arms.§ 230. The dangers, too, to all the states, in case ofdivision, from foreign wars and invasion, must be imminent,independent of those from the neighbourhoodof the colonies and dependencies of other governmentson this continent. Their very weakness would inviteaggression. The ambition of the European governments,to obtain a mastery of power in colonies anddistant possessions, would be perpetually involvingthem in embarrassing negotiations or conflicts, howeverpeaceable might be their own conduct, and howeverinoffensive their own pursuits and objects. America,as of old, would become the theatre of warlike operations,in which she had no interests ; and with a viewto their own security, the states would be compelled tofall back into a general colonial submission, or sink intodependencies of such of the great European powers,as might be most favorable to their interests, or mostcommanding over their resources.172 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.^231 There are also peculiar interests of some ofthe states, which would, upon a separation, be whollysacrificed, or become the source of immeasurable calamities.The New-england states have a vital interestin the fisheries with their rivals, England and France ;and how could New-england resist either of these powersin a struggle for the common right, if it should beattempted to be restrained or abolished ? What wouldbecome of Maryland and Virginia, if the Chesapeakewere under the dominion of different foreign powersde facto, though not in form '? The free navigation ofthe Mississippi and the lakes, and it may be added, theexclusive navigation of them, seems indispensable tothe security, as well as the prosperity of the westernstates. How otherwise than by a general union, couldthis be maintained or guarantied ?§ 232. And again, as to commerce, so important tothe navigating states, and so productive to the agriculturalstates, it must be at once perceived, that no adequateprotection could be given to either, unless by thestrong and uniform operations of a general government.Each state by its own regulations would seek to promoteits own interests, to the ruin or injury of those ofothers. The relative situation of these states ; thenumber of rivers, by which they are intersected, and ofbays, that wash their shores ; the facility of communicationin every direction ; the affinity of language andmanners ; the familiar habits of intercourse ; all thesecircumstances would conspire to render an illicit tradebetween them matter of Httle difficulty, and would insurefrequent evasions of the commercial regulations ofeach other. All foreign nations would have a commoninterest in crippling us ; and all the evils of colonialservitude, and commercial monopoly would be inflictedCH. VI.] THE PREAMBLE. 173upon us, by the hands of our own kindred and neighbours.But this topic, though capable of being presentedin detail from our past experience in such glowingcolours, as to startle the most incredulous into aconviction of the ultimate poverty, wretchedness, anddistress, which would overwhelm every state, does notrequire to be more than hinted at. We have alreadyseen in our former examination of the defects of theconfederation, that every state was ruined in its revenues,as well as in its commerce, by the want of a moreefficient government.§ 233. Nor should it be imagined, that however injuriousto commerce, the evils would be less in respectto domestic manufactures and agriculture. In respectto manufactures, the truth is so obvious, that it requiresno argument to illustrate it. In relation to the agriculturalstates, however, an opinion has, at some timesand in some sections of the country, been prevalent,that the agricultural interests would be equally safewithout any general government. The following,among other considerations, may serve to show thefallacy of all such suggestions. A large and uniformmarket at home for native productions has a tendencyto prevent those sudden rises and falls in prices, whichare so deeply injurious to the farmer and the planter.The exclusive possession of the home market againstall foreign competition gives a permanent security toinvestments, which slowly yield their returns, and encouragesthe laying out of capital in agricultural improvements.Suppose cotton, tobacco, and wheatwhere at all times admissible from foreign states withoutduty, would not the effect be permanently to checkany cultivation beyond what at the moment seems sureof a safe sale ? Would not foreign nations be perpetuaCONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.sally tempted to send their surplus here, and thus,from time to time, depress or glut the home market ?§ 234. Again ; the neighbouring states would oftenengage in the same species of cultivation ; and yet withvery different natural, or artificial means of making theproducts equally cheap. This inequality would immediatelygive rise to legislative measures to correct theevil, and to secure, if possible, superior advantagesover the rival state. This would introduce endlesscrimination and retaliation, laws for defence, and lawsfor offence. Smuggling would be every where openlyencouraged, or secretly connived at. The vital interestsof a state would lie in many instances at the mercyof its neighbours, who might, at the same time, feel,that their own interests were promoted by the ruin oftheir neighbours. And the distant states, knowingthat their own wants and pursuits were wholly disregarded,would become willing auxiliaries in any plansto encourage cultivation and consumption elsewhere.Such is human nature ! Such are the infirmities, whichhistory severely instructs us belong to neighbours andrivals ; to those, who navigate, and those, who plant ; tothose, who desire, and those, who repine at the prosperityof surrounding states.^ 235. Again ; foreign nations, under such circumstances,must have a common interest, as carriers, tobring to the agricultural states their own manufactures,at as dear a rate as possible, and to depress the marketof the domestic products to the minimum price of competition.They must have a common interest to stimulatethe neighbouring states to a ruinous jealousy ; orby fostering the interests of one, with whom they candeal upon more advantageous terms, or over whomthey have acquired a decisive influence, to subject to aCH VI.] THE PREAMBLE. 175corresponding influence others, which struggle for anindependent existence. This is not mere theory.Examples, and successful examples of this policy, maybetraced throughout the period between the peace of1783 and the adoption of the constitution.§ 236. But not to dwell farther on these importantinducements " to form a more perfect union," let uspass to the next object, which is to " establish justice."This must for ever be one of the great ends of everywise government ; and even in arbitrary governmentsit must, to a great extent, be practised, at least in respectto private persons, as the only security againstrebellion, private vengeance, and popular cruelty. Butina free government it lies at the very basis of all itsinstitutions. Without justice being freely, fully, andimpartially administered, neither our persons, nor ourrights, nor our property, can be protected. And ifthese, or either of them, are regulated by no certainlaws, and are subject to no certain principles, and areheld by no certain tenure, and are redressed, whenviolated, by no certain remedies, society fails of all itsvalue ; and men may as well return to a state of savageand barbarous independence. No one can doubt,therefore, that the establishment of justice must be onemain object of all our state governments. Why, then,may it be asked, should it form so prominent a motivein the establishment of the national government 7§ 237. This is now proposed to be shown in a concisemanner. In the administration of justice, foreignnations, and foreign individuals, as well as citizens, havea deep stake ; but the former have not always as completemeans of redress as the latter ; for it may be presumed,that the state laws will always provide adequatetribunals to redress the grievances and sustain176 Constitutions of the U. states. [book III*the rights of their own citizens. But this would be avery imperfect view of the subject. Citizens of contiguousstates have a very deep interest in the administrationof justice in each state ; and even those, whichare more distant, but belonging to the same confederacy,cannot but be affected by every inequality in theprovisions, or in the actual operations of the laws of eachother. While every state remains at full liberty tolegislate upon the subject of rights, preferences, contracts,and remedies, as it may please, it is scarcely tobe expected, that they will all concur in the same generalsystem of policy. The natural tendency of everygovernment is to favour its own citizens ; and unjustpreferences, not only in the administration of justice,but in the very structure of the laws, may reasonablybe expected to arise. Popular prejudices, or passions,supposed or real injuries, the predominance of homepursuits and feelings over the comprehensive views ofa liberal jurisprudence, will readily achieve the mostmischievous projects for this purpose. And these,again, by a natural reaction, will introduce correspondentregulations, and retaliatory measures in otherstates.§ 238. JN'ow, exactly what this course of reasoning"would lead us to presume as probable, has-been demonstratedby experience to be true in respect to our ownconfederacy, during the short period of its existence,and under circumstances well calculated to induceeach state to sacrifice many of its own objects for thegeneral good. Nay, even when we were colonies,dependent upon the authority of the mother country,these inequalities were observable in the local legislationof several of the states, and produced heart-burningsand discontents, which were not easily appeased.CH. VI.] THE PREAMBLE. 177§ 239. First, in respect to foreign nations. Afterthe confederacy was formed, and we had assumed thegeneral rights of war as a sovereign belligerent nation,authority to make captures, and to bring in ships andcargoes for adjudication naturally flowed from theproper exercise of these rights by the law of nations.The states respectively retained the power of appointingprize tribunals, to take cognizance of these mattersin the first instance ; and thus thirteen distinct jurisdictionswere established, which acted entirely independentof each other. It is true, that the articles ofconfederation had delegated to the general governmentthe authority of establishing courts for receiving anddetermining, finally, appeals in all cases of captures.Congress accordingly instituted proper appellate tribunals,to which the state courts were subordinate,and, upon constitutional principles, were bound to yieldobedience. But it is notorious, that the decisions ofthe appellate tribunals where disregarded, and treatedas mere nullities, for no power to enforce them waslodged in congress. They operated, therefore, merelyby moral influence and requisition, and, as such, soonsunk into insignificance. Neutral individuals, as wellas neutral nations, were left wholly without any adequateredress for the most inexcusable injustice, andthe confederacy was subjected to imminent hazards.Until the constitution of the United States was established,no remedy was ever effectually administered.Treaties, too, were formed by congress with variousnations ; and above all, the treaty of peace of 1 783,which gave complete stability to our independenceagainst Great Britain. These treaties were, by thetheory of the confederation, absolutely obligatory uponall the states. Yet their provisions were notoriouslyAbr. 23A.178 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.violated both by state legislation and state judicial tribunals.The non-fulfilment of the stipulations of theBritish treaty on our part more than once threatenedto involve the whole country again in war. And theprovision in that treaty for the payment of British debtswas practically disregarded in many, if not in all thestate courts. These debts never were enforced, untilthe constitution gave them a direct and adequate sanction,independently of state legislation and statecourts.§ 240. Besides the debts due to foreigners, and theobligations to pay the same, the public debt of theUnited States was left utterly unprovided for ; and theofficers and soldiers of the revolution, who had achievedour independence, were, as we have had occasionto notice, suffered to languish in want, and their justdemands evaded, or passed by with indifference. Noefficient system to pay the public creditors was evercarried into operation, until the constitution was adopted; and, notwithstanding the increase of the publicdebt, occasioned by intermediate wars, it is now on thevery eve of a total extinguishment.§ 241. These evils, whatever might be their magnitude,did not create so universal a distress, or so muchprivate discontent, as others of a more domestic nature,which were subversive of the first principles of justice.Independent of the unjustifiable preferences, whichwere fostered in favour of citizens of the state overthose belonging to other states, which were not few,nor slight, there were certain calamities inflicted by thecommon course of legislation in most of the states,which went to the prostration of all public faith and allprivate credit. Laws were constantly made by theestate legislatures violating, with more or less degreesCH. VI.] THE PREAMBLE. 179of aggravation, the sacredness of private contracts.Laws compelling the receipt of a depreciated and depreciatingpaper currency in payment of debts weregenerally, if not universally, prevalent. Laws authorizingthe payment of debts by instalments, at periodsdiffering entirely from the original terms of the contract; laws, suspending, for a limited or uncertain period,the remedies to recover debts in the ordinarycourse of legal proceedings ; laws authorizing the deliveryof any sort of property, however unproductive orundesirable, in payment of debts upon an arbitrary orfriendly appraisement ; laws shutting up the courts forcertain periods and under certain circumstances ; werenot infrequent upon the statute books of many of thestates now composing the Union. In the rear of allthese came the systems of general insolvent laws, someof which were of a permanent nature, and others againwere adopted upon the spur of the occasion, like a sortof gaol delivery under the Lords' Acts in England, whichhad so few guards against frauds of every kind by thedebtor, that in practice they amounted to an absolutedischarge from every debt, without any thing more thananominal dividend; and sometimes even this vainmockery was dispensed with. In short, by the operationsof paper currency, tender laws, instalment laws,suspension laws, appraisement laws, and insolvent laws,contrived with all the dexterous ingenuity of men oppressedby debt, and popular by the very extent ofprivate embarrassments, the states were almost universallyplunged into a ruinous poverty, distrust, debility,and indifference to justice. The local tribunals werebound to obey the legislative will ; and in the few instances,in which it was resisted, the independence ofthe judges was sacrificed to the temper of the times.180 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.It is well known, that Shays's rebellion in Massachusettstook its origin from this source. The object wasto prostrate the regular administration of justice by asystem of terror, which should prevent the recovery ofdebts and taxes.^ 242. So, that we see completely demonstrated byour own history the importance of a more effectualestablishment of justice under the auspices of a nationalgovernment.^ ^ 243. The next clause in the preamble is " to ensuredomestic tranquillity." The illustrations appropriateto this head have been in a great measure anticipatedin our previous observations. The security ofthe states against foreign influence, domestic dissensions,commercial rivalries, legislative retaliations, territorialdisputes, and the petty irritations of a borderwarfare for privileges, exemptions, and smuggling, havebeen already noticed. The very habits of intercourse,to which the states were accustomed with each otherduring their colonial state, would, as has been justlyremarked, give a keener edge to every discontent excitedby any inequalities, preferences, or exclusions,growing out of the public policy of any of them.These, however, are not the only evils. In small communitiesdomestic factions may well be expected toarise, which, when honest, may lead to the most perniciouspublic measures ; and when corrupt, to domesticinsurrections, and even to an overthrow of the government.The dangers to a republican government from thissource have been dwelt upon by the advocates of arbitrarygovernment with much exultation ; and it mustbe confessed, that the history of free governments hasfurnished but too many examples to apologize for,though not to justify their arguments, urged not onlyCH. VI.] THE PREAMBLE. 181against the forms of republican government, but againstthe principles of civil liberty. They have pointed outthe brief duration of republics, the factions, by whichthey have been rent, and the miseries, which they havesuffered from distracted councils, and time-servingpolicy, and popular fury, and corruption, in a mannercalculated to increase the solicitude of every wellwishersto the cause of rational liberty. And even those,who are most favourable in their views, seem to havethought, that the experience of the world had never yetfurnished any conclusive proofs in its support. Weknow but too well, that factions have been the specialgrowth of republics. By a faction, we are to understanda number of citizens, whether amounting to aminority or majority of the whole, who are united bysome common impulse or passion, or interest, or party,adverse to the rights of the other citizens, or to thepermanent and aggregate interests of the community.^ 244. There are but two methods of curing themischiefs of faction ; the one, by removing its causes,which, in a free government, is impracticable withoutthe destruction of liberty ; the other, by controlling itseffects. If a faction be a minority, the majority mayapply the proper corrective, by defeating or checkingthe violence of the minority in the regular course oflegislation. In small states, however, this is not alwayseasily attainable, from the difficulty of combining in apermanent form sufficient influence for this purpose.A feeble domestic faction will naturally avail itself, notonly of all accidental causes of dissatisfaction at home,but also of all foreign aid and influence to carry its projects.And, indeed, in the gradual operations of factions,so many combinations are formed and dissolved,so many private resentments become embodied in CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.lie measures, and success and triumph so often followafter defeat, that the remnants of different factions,which have had a brief sway, however hostile to eachother, have an interest to unite in order to put downtheir rivals. But if the faction be a majority, and standunchecked, except by its own sense of duty, or its ownfears, the dangers are imminent to all those, whoseprinciples, or interests, or characters stand in the wayof its supreme dominion.^ 245. These evils are felt in great states ; but it hasbeen justly observed, that in small states they are farmore aggravated, bitter, cruel, and permanent. Themost effectual means to control such effects seem to bein the formation of a confederate republic, consisting ofseveral states. It will be rare, under such circumstances,if proper powers are confided to the generalgovernment, that the state line does not form the natural,as it will the jurisdictional boundary of the operationsof factions. The authority of the general governmentwill have a natural tendency to suppress the violenceof faction, by diminishing the chances of ultimatesuccess ; and the example of the neighbouring states,who will rarely, at the same time, partake of the samefeelings, or have the same causes to excite them intoaction, will mitigate, if it does not wholly Swarm, theviolence of the predominant faction.^ 246. We now proceed to the next clause in thepreamble, to " provide for the common defence." Andmany of the considerations already stated apply withstill greater force under this head. One of the surestmeans of preserving peace is said to be, by beingalways prepared for war. But a still more sure meansis the power to repel, with effect, every aggression.That power can scarcely be attained without a wideCH. VI.] THE PREAMBLE. 183extent of population, and at least a moderate extent ofterritory. A country, which is large in its limits, evenif thinly peopled, is not easily subdued. Its variety ofsoil and climate, its natural and artificial defences, nay,its very poverty and scantiness of supplies, make it difficultto gain, or to secure a permanent conquest. It isfar easier to overrun, than to subdue it. Armies mustbe divided, distant posts must be maintained, and channelsof supplies kept constantly open. But where theterritory is not only large, but populous, permanent conquestcan rarely occur, unless (which is not our case)there are very powerful neighbours on every side, havinga common interest to assist each other, and to subjugatetheir enemy. It is far otherwise, where thereare many rival and independent states, having no commonunion of government or interests. They are halfsubdued by their own dissensions, jealousies, and resentmentsbefore the conflict is begun. They are easilymade to act a part in the destruction of each other, oreasily fall a prey for want of proper concert and energyof operations.§ 247. Besides; — The resources of a confederacymust be far greater than those of any single state belongingto it, both for peace and war. It can commanda wider range of revenue, of military power, ofnaval armaments, and of productive industry. It ismore independent in its employments, in its capacities,and in its influences. In the present state of the world,a few great powers possess the command of commerce,both on land and at sea. In war, they trample uponthe rights of neutrals, who are feeble ; for their weaknessfurnishes an excuse both for servility and disdain.In peace, they control the pursuits of the rest of theworld, and force their trade into every channel by thev»'184 CONSTITUTION OF THE U, STATES. [bOOK III.activity of their enterprise, their extensive navigation,and their flourishing manufactures. They little regardthe complaints of those, vi^ho are subdivided into pettystates with varying interests ; and use them only as instrumentsto annoy or check the enterprise of eachother. Such states are not formidable in peace or inwar. To secure their rights and maintain their independencethey must become a confederated nation, andspeak with the force of numbers, as well as the eloquenceof truth. The navy or army, which could bemaintained by any single state in the Union, would bescarcely formidable to any second rate power in Europe.It would be a grievous public burthen, and exhaust thewhole resources of the state. But a navy or army forall the purposes of home defence, or protection uponthe ocean, is within the compass of the resources of thegeneral government, without any severe exaction. Andwith the growing strength of the Union must be at oncemore safe for us, and more formidable to foreign nations.The means, therefore, to provide for the common defenceare ample ; and they can only be rendered inertand inadequate by a division among the states, and awant of unity of operations.^ 248. We pass, in the next place, to the clause topromote the general welfare." And it may be asked,as the state governments are formed for the same purposeby the people, why should this be set forth, as apeculiar or prominent object of the constitution of theUnited States? To such an inquiry two general answersmay be given. (1.) The states, separately, wouldnot possess the means. (2.) If they did possess themeans, they would not possess the power to carry theappropriate measures into operation.CH. VI.] THE PREAMBLE. 186^ 249. First, in respect to means. It is obvious fromthe local position and size of several of the states, thatthey must for ever possess but a moderate revenue, notmore than what is indispensable for their own wants,and, in the strictest sense, for domestic improvements.In relation to others more favourably situated for commerceand navigation, the revenues from taxation maybelarger ; but the main reliance must be placed uponthe taxation by way of imposts upon importations.Now, it is obvious, from the remarks already made, thatno permanent revenue can be raised from this source,when the states are separated. The evasions of thelaws, which will constantly take place from the rivalries,and various interests of the neighbouring states ; thefacilities afforded by the numerous harbours, rivers, andbays, which indent and intersect our coasts ; the stronginterest of foreigners to promote smuggling ; the wantof uniformity in the duties laid by the different states ;the means of intercourse along the internal territorialboundaries of the commercial states ; these, and manyother causes, would inevitably lead to a very feeble administrationof any local revenue system, and wouldmake its returns moderate and unsatisfactory. Whatcould New-york do with a single sea-port, surroundedon each side by jealous maritime neighbours with numerousports 1 What could Massachusetts, or Connecticutdo with the intermediate territory of Rhode-island,running into the heart of these states by watercommunications admirably adapted for the security ofillicit trade? What could Maryland, or Virginia dowith the broad Chesapeake between them with itsthousand landing places? What could Pennsylvaniaoppose to the keen resentments, or the facile policy ofher weaker neighbour, Delaware ? What could anyAbr. 24186 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.single state on the Mississippi do to force a steady tradefor itself with adequate protecting duties? In short,turn to whichever part of the continent we may, thedifficulties of maintaining . an adequate system of revenuewould be insurmountable, and the expenses of collectingit enormous. After some few struggles for uniformity,and co-operation for mutual support, each statewould sink back into Useless indifference or gloomy despondency; and rely, principally, upon direct taxationfor its ordinary supplies. The experience of the fewyears succeeding the peace of 1783 fully justifies theworst apprehensions on this head.§ 250. On the other hand, a general government,clothed with suitable authority over all the states, couldeasily guard the whole Atlantic coast, and make it theinterest of all honourable merchants to assist in a regularand punctilious payment of duties. Vessels arriving atdifferent ports of the Union would rarely choose to exposethemselves to the perils of seizure, not in a singlestate only, but in every state, into which the goodsmight be successively imported. The dangers uponthe coast, from the vigilant operations of the revenueofficers and revenue vessels, would be great ; and theywould be much enhanced by the expenses of concealmentafter the goods were landed. And the fact hascorresponded with the theory. Since the establishmentof the national government, there has been comparativelylittle smuggling on our coasts ; and the revenuefrom the duties upon importations has steadily increasedwith the development of the other resources of thecountry.§ 251. But the fact alone of an unlimited intercourse,without duty or restriction, between all thestates, is of itself a blessing of almost inconceivableCH. VI.] THE PREAMBLE. 187value. It makes it an object with each permanently tolook to the interests of all, and to withdraw its operationsfrom the narrow sphere of its own exclusive territory.Without entering here into the inquiry, how farthe general government possesses the power to make,or aid in the making of roads, canals, and other generalimprovements, which will properly arise in our futurediscussions, it is clear, that, if there were no generalgovernment, the interest of each state to undertake, orto promote in its own legislation any such project, wouldbe far less strong, than it now is ; since there would beno certainty, as to the value or duration of such improvements,looking beyond the boundaries of the state.The consciousness, that the Union of the states is permanent,and will not be broken up by rivalries, or conflictsof policy, that caprice, or resentment, will not divertany state from its proper duties, as a member ofthe Union, will give a solid character to all improvements.Independent of the exercise of any authorityby the general government for this purpose, it was justlyforeseen, that roads would be every where shortenedand kept in better order; accommodations for travellerswould be multiplied and meliorated ; an interior navigationon our eastern side would be opened throughoutthe whole extent of our coast ; and, by canals and improvementsin river navigation, a boundless field openedto enterprise and emigration, to commerce and products,through the interior states, to the farthest Unitsof our western territories.^ 252. Independent of these means of promoting thegeneral welfare, we shall at once see, in our negotiationswith foreign powers, the vast superiority of a nationcombining numbers and resources over states ofsmall extent, and divided by different interests. If we188 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III,are to negotiate for commercial or other advantages,the national government has more authority to speak,as well as more power to influence, than can belong toa single state. It has more valuable privileges to givein exchange, and more means of making those privilegesfelt by prohibitions, or relaxations of its commerciallegislation. Is money wanted ; how much moreeasy and cheap to borrow upon the faith of a nationcompetent to pay, than of a single state of fluctuatingpolicy. Is confidence asked for the faithful fulfilmentof treaty stipulations ; how much more strong the guarantyof the Union with suitable authorities, than anypledge of an individual state. Is a currency wanted atonce fixed on a solid basis, and sustained by adequatesanctions to enlarge public or private credit ; how muchmore decisive is the legislation of the Union, than thatof a single state, with a view to extent, or uniformity ofoperations.§ 253. Thus we see, that the national government,suitably organized, has more efficient means, and moreextensive jurisdiction to promote the general welfare,than can belong to any single state of the confederacy.And there is much truth in the suggestion, that it willgenerally be directed by a more enlightened policy, amore liberal justice, and more comprehensive wisdom,in the application of its means and its powers to theirappropriate end. Generally speaking, it will be betteradministered ; because it will command higher talents,more extensive experience, more practical knowledge,and more various information of the wants of the wholecommunity, than can belong to smaller societies. Thewider the sphere of action, the less reason there is topresume, that narrow views, or local prejudices willprevail in the public councils. The very diversities ofCH. VI.] THE PREAMBLE. 189opinion in the different representatives of distant regionswill have a tendency, not only to introduce mutualconcession and conciliation, but to elevate the policy,and instruct the judgment of those, who are to directthe public measures.§ 254. The last clause in the preamble is to " securethe blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity."And surely no object could be more worthy of the wisdomand ambition of the best men in any age. If thereis any thing, which may justly challenge the admirationof all mankind, it is that sublime patriotism, which,looking beyond its own times, and its own fleeting pursuits,aims to secure the permanent happiness of posterityby laying the broad foundations of governmentupon immovable principles of justice. Our affections,indeed, may naturally be presumed to outlive the brieflimits of our own lives, and to repose with deep sensibilityupon our own immediate descendants. But thereis a noble disinterestedness in that forecast, which disregardspresent objects for the sake of all mankind,and erect structures to protect, support, and bless themost distant generations. He, who founds a hospital,a college, or even a more private and limited charity, isjustly esteemed a benefactor of the human race. Howmuch more do they deserve our reverence and praise,whose Hves are devoted to the formation of institutions,which, when they and their children are mingled in thecommon dust, may continue to cherish the principlesand the practice of liberty in perpetual freshness andvigour.^ 255. The grand design of the state governments is,doubtless, to accomplish this important purpose ; andthere can be no doubt, that they are, when well administered,well adapted to the end. But the question is190 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.not SO much, whether they conduce to the preservationof the blessings of liberty, as whether they of themselvesfurnish a complete and satisfactory security. If theremarks, which have been already offered, are foundedin sound reasoning and human experience, they establishthe position, that the state governments, per se, areincompetent and inadequate to furnish such guards andguaranties, as a free people have a right to require forthe maintenance of their vital interests, and especiallyof their liberty. The inquiry then naturally presentsitself, whether the establishment of a national governmentwill afford more effectual and adequate securities.^ 256. The fact has been already adverted to, thatwhen the constitution was before the people for adoption,it was generally represented by its opponents, thatits obvious tendency to a consolidation of the powersof government would subvert the state sovereignties,and thus prove dangerous to the liberties of the people.This indeed was a topic dwelt on with peculiar emphasis; and it produced so general an alarm and terror,that it came very nigh accomplishing the rejection ofthe constitution. And yet the reasoning, by which itwas supported, was so vague and unsatisfactory ; andthe reasoning, on the other side, was so cogent andjust, that it seems difficult to conceive, how, at thattime, or at any later time, (for it has often been resortedto for the same purpose,) the suggestion could havehad any substantial influence upon the public opinion.§ 257. Let us glance at a few considerations, (someof which have been already hinted at,) which are calculatedto suppress all alarm upon this subject. In thefirst place, the government of the United States is oneof limited powers, leaving all residuary general powersin the state governments, or in the people thereof. TheCH. VI.] THE PREAMBLE. 191jurisdiction of the general government is confined to afew enumerated objects, which concern the commonwelfare of all the states. The state governments have afull superintendence and control over the immense massof local interests of their respective states, which connectthemselves with the feelings, the affections, themunicipal institutions, and the internal arrangements ofthe whole population. They possess, too, the immediateadministration of justice in all cases, civil andcriminal, which concern the property, personal rights,and peaceful pursuits of their own citizens. Theymust of course possess a large share of influence ; andbeing independent of each other, will have many opportunitiesto interpose checks, as well as to combine acommon resistance, to any undue exercise of power bythe general government, independent of direct force.^ 258. In the next place, the state governments are,by the very theory of the constitution, essential constituentparts of the general government. They canexist without the latter, but the latter cannot exist withoutthem. Without the intervention of the state legislatures,the president of the United States cannot beelected at all ; and the senate is exclusively and absolutelyunder the choice of the state legislatures.The representatives are chosen by the people of thestates. So that the executive and legislative branchesof the national government depend upon, and emanatefrom the states. Every where the state sovereigntiesare represented ; and the national sovereignty, assuch, has no representation. How is it possible, undersuch circumstances, that the national government canbe dangerous to the liberties of the people, unless thestates, and the people of the states, conspire togetherfor their overthrow ? If there should be such a CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.spiracy,fis not this more justly to be deemed an act ofthe states through their own agents, and by their ownchoice, rather than a corrupt usurpation by the generalgovernment 7^ 259. Besides ; the perpetual organization of thestate governments, in all their departments, executive,legislative, and judicial ; their natural tendency to cooperationin cases of threatened danger to their commonliberties ; the perpetually recurring right of theelective franchise, at short intervals, must present themost formidable barriers against any deliberate usurpation,which does not arise from the hearty co-operationof the people of the states. And when such a generalco-operation for usurpation shall exist, it is obvious,that neither the general, nor the state governments, caninterpose any permanent protection. Each must submitto that public will, which created, and may destroythem.^ 260. Another not unimportant consideration is,that the powers of the general government will be, andindeed must be, principally employed upon externalobjects, such as war, peace, negotiations with foreignpowers, and foreign commerce. In its internal operationsit can touch but few objects, except to introduceregulations beneficial to the commerce, intercourse, andother relations, between the states, and to lay taxes forthe common good. The powers of the states, on theother hand, extend to all objects, which, in the ordinary icourse of affairs, concern the Hves, and liberties, andproperty of the people, and the internal order, improvement,and prosperity of the state. The operations ofthe general government will be most extensive and importantin times of war and danger ; those of the stategovernments in times of peace and security. .VI.] THE PREAMBLE. 193pendent of all other considerations, the fact, that thestates possess a concurrent power of taxation, and anexclusive power to regulate the descents, devise, anddistribution of estates, (a power the most formidable todespotism, and the most indispensable in its right exerciseto republicanism,) will for ever give them an .influence, which will be as commanding, as, with referenceto the safety of the Union, they could deliberatelydesire.^261. Hitherto our experience has demonstratedthe entire safety of the states, under the benign operationsof the constitution. Each of the states has grownin power, in vigour of operation, in commanding influence,in wealth, revenue, population, commerce, agriculture,and general efficiency. No man will ventureto affirm, that their power, relative to that of the Union,has been diminished, although our population has, in theintermediate period, passed from three to more thantwelve millions. No man will pretend to say, that theaffection for the state governments has been sensiblydiminished by the operations of the general government.If the latter has become more deeply an object of regardand reverence, of attachment and pride, it is, becauseit is felt to be the parental guardian of our publicand private rights, and the natural ally of all the stategovernments, in the administration of justice, and thepromotion of the general prosperity. Ii is beloved, notfor its power, but for its beneficence ; not because itcommands, but because it protects ; not because itcontrols, but because it sustains the common interests,and the common liberties, and the common rights ofthe people.^ 262. If, upon a closer survey of all the powers givenby the constitution, and all the guards upon theirAbr. 25194 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.exercise, we shall perceive still stronger inducementsto fortify this conclusion, and to increase our confidencein the constitution, may we not justly hope, that everyhonest American will concur in the dying expression ofFather Paul, " Est perpetua," may it he perpetualCH VII.] DISTRIBUTION OF POWERS. 195CHAPTER VII.DISTRIBUTION OF POWERS.§ 263. In surveying the general structure of theconstitution of the United States, we are naturally ledto an examination of the fundamental principles, onwhich it is organized, for the purpose of carrying intoeffect the objects disclosed in the preamble. Everygovernment must include within its scope, at least if itis to possess suitable stability and energy, the exerciseof the three great powers, upon which all governmentsare supposed to rest, viz. the executive, the legislative,and the judicial powers. The manner and extent, inwhich these powers are to be exercised, and the functionaries,in whom they are to be vested, constitute thegreat distinctions, which are known in the forms ofgovernment. In absolute governments the wholeexecutive, legislative, and judicial powers are, at leastin their final result, exclusively confided to a single individual; and such a form of government is denominateda despotism, as the whole sovereignty of the state isvested in him. If the same powers are exclusively confidedto a few persons, constituting a permanent sovereigncouncil, the government may be appropriatelydenominated an absolute or despotic Aristocracy. Ifthey are exercised by the people at large in their originalsovereign assemblies, the government is a pure andabsolute Democracy. But it is more common to findthese powers divided, and separately exercised by independentfunctionaries, the executive power by onedepartment, the legislative by another, and the judicial196 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.by a third; and in these cases the government is properlydeemed a mixed one ; a mixed monarchy, if theexecutive power is hereditary in a single person ; amixed aristocracy, if it is hereditary in several chieftainsor families ; and a mixed democracy or republic, if it isdelegated by election, and is not hereditary. In mixedmonarchies and aristocracies some of the functionariesof the legislative and judicial powers are, or at leastmay be hereditary. But in a representative republicall power emanates from the people, and is exercisedby their choice, and never extends beyond the lives ofthe individuals, to whom it is 'entrusted. It may beentrusted for any shorter period ; and then it returns tothem again, to be again delegated by a new choice.^ 264. In the convention, which framed the constitutionof the United States, the first resolution adoptedby that body was, that " a national, government ought tobe established, consisting of a supreme legislative, judiciary,and executive." And from this fundamentalproposition sprung the subsequent organization of thewhole government of the United States.^ 265. In the establishment of free governments,the division of the three great powers of government,the executive, the legislative, and the judicial,among different functionaries, has been a favorite policywith patriots and statesmen. It has by many beendeemed a maxim of vital importance, that these powersshould for ever be kept separate and distinct.And accordingly we find it laid down vail emphaticcare in the bill of rights of several of the state constitutions.^ 266. The general reasoning, by which the maximis supported, independently of the just weight of theauthority in its support, seems entirely satisfactory.CH VII.] DISTRIBUTION OF POWERS. 197What is of far more value than any mere reasoning,experience has demonstrated it to be founded in a justview of the nature of government, and the safety andliberty of the people. And it is no small commendationof the constitution of the United States, that instead ofadopting a new theory, it has placed this practical truth,as the basis of its organization. It has placed the legislative,executive, and judicial powers in differenthands. It has, as we shall presently see, made theirterm of office and their organization different ; and, forobjects of permanent and paramount importance, hasgiven to the judicial department a tenure of office duringgood behaviour ; while it has limited each of theothers to a term of years.^ 267. But when we speak of a separation of thethree great departments of government, and maintain,that that separation is indispensable to public liberty,we are to understand this maxim in a limited sense.It is not meant to affirm, that they must be kept whollyand entirely separate and distinct, and have no commonlink of connexion or dependence, the one uponthe other, in the slightest degree. The true meaningis, that the whole power of one of these departmentsshould not be exercised by the same hands, which possessthe whole power of either of the other departments;and that, such exercise of the whole would subvert theprinciples of a free constitution.§ 268. How far the constitution of the UnitedStates, in the actual separation of these departments,and the occasional mixtures of some of the powersof each, has accomplished the objects of the greatmaxim, which we have been considering, will appearmore fully, when a survey is taken of the particularpowers confided to each department. But198 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.the true and only test must, after all, be experience,which corrects at once the errors of theory,and fortifies and illustrates the eternal judgments ofnature.GH. VIII,] THE LEGISLATURE. 199CHAPTER VIII.THE LEGISLATURE.§ 269. The first article of the constitution containsthe structure, organization, and powers, of the legislatureof the Union. Each section of that article, andindeed, of every other article, will require a carefulanalysis, and distinct examination. It is proposed,therefore, to bring each separately under review, in thepresent commentaries, and to unfold the reasons, onwhich each is founded, the objections, which have beenurged against it, and the interpretation, so far as it canbe satisfactorily ascertained, of the terms, in which eachis expressed.^ 270. The first section of the first article is in thefollowing words : " All legislative powers hereingranted shall be vested in a congress of the UnitedStates, which shall consist of a senate and house ofrepresentatives."^271. This section involves, as a fundamental rule,the exercise of the legislative power by two distinctand independent branches. Under the confederation,the whole legislative power of the Union was vested inasingle branch. Limited as was that power, the concentrationof it in a single body was deemed a prominentdefect of the confederation. But if a single assemblycould properly be deemed a fit receptacle of theslender and fettered authorities, confided to the federalgovernment by that instrument, it could scarcely beconsistent with the principles of a good government toentrust it with the more enlarged and vigorous powersdelegated in the constitution.200 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.^ 272. The utility of a subdivision of the legislativepower into different branches, having a negative uponeach other, is, perhaps, at the present time admittedby most persons of sound reflection. But it has notalways found general approbation ; and it is, even now,sometimes disputed by men of speculative ingenuity,and recluse habits. It has been justly observed,that there is scarcely in the whole science of politics amore important maxim, and one, which bears withgreater influence upon the practical operations of government.^ 273. It may not, therefore, be uninstructive to reviewsome of the principal arguments, by which thisdivision is vindicated. The first and most importantground is, that it forms a great check upon undue, hasty,and oppressive legislation. Public bodies, like privatepersons, are occasionally under the dominion of strongpassions and excitements ; and are impatient, irritable,and impetuous. The habit of acting together produces astrong tendency to what, for want of a better word, maybecalled the corporation spirit, or what is so happilyexpressed in a foreign phrase, Esprit du corps. Certainpopular leaders often acquire an extraordinary ascendencyover the body, by their talents, their eloquence,their intrigues, or their cunning. Measures areoften introduced in a hurry, and debated with little care,and examined with less caution. The very restlessnessof many minds produces an utter impossibility ofdebating with much deliberation, when a measure has aplausible aspect, and enjoys a momentary favour. Noris it infrequent, especially in cases of this sort, to overlookwell-founded objections to a measure, not onlybecause the advocates of it have Httle desire to bringthem in review, but because the opponents are oftenCH. VIII.] THE LEGISLATURE* 201seduced into a credulous silence. A legislative body isnot ordinarily apt to mistrust its own powers, and farless the temperate exercise of those powers. As itprescribes its own rules for its own deliberations, iteasily relaxes them, whenever any pressure is made foran immediate decision. If it feels no check but its ownwill, it rarely has the firmness to insist upon holding aquestion long enough under its own view, to see andmark it in all its bearings and relations on society.^ 274. But it is not merely inconsiderate and rashlegislation, which is to be guarded against, in the ordinarycourse of things. There is a strong propensity inpublic bodies to accumulate power in their own hands,to widen the extent of their own influence, and to absorbwithin their own circle the means, and the motivesof patronage. If the whole legislative power is vestedin a single body, there can be, practically, no restraintupon the fullest exercise of that power ; and of anyusurpation, which it may seek to excuse or justify,either from necessity, or a superior regard to the publicgood. It has been often said, that necessity is the pleaof tyrants ; but it is equally true, that it is the plea of allpublic bodies invested with power, where no check existsupon its exercise. Mr. Hume has remarked withgreat sagacity, that men are generally more honest intheir private, than in their public capacity ; and will gogreater lengths to serve a party, than when their ownprivate interest is alone concerned. Honour is a greatcheck upon mankind. But where a considerable bodyof men act together, this check is in a great measureremoved, since a man is sure to be approved of by hisown party, for what promotes the common interest ;and he soon learns to despise the clamours of adversaries.This is by no means an opinion peculiar to Mr.Abr. 26202 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK llHume. It will be found lying at the foundation of thepolitical reasonings of many of the greatest men in allages, as the result of a close survey of the passions, andinfirmities, of the history, and experience of mankind.With a view, therefore, to preserve the rights and libertiesof the people against unjust encroachments, andto secure the equal benefits of a free constitution, it isof vital importance to interpose some check against theundue exercise of the legislative power, which in everygovernment is the predominating, and almost irresistiblepower.§ 275. The value, then, of a distribution of the legislativepower, between two branches, each possessing anegative upon the other, may be summed up under thefollowing heads. First : It operates directly as a securityagainst hasty, rash, and dangerous legislation ;and allows errors and mistakes to be corrected, beforethey have produced any public mischiefs. It interposesdelay between the introduction, and final adoptionof a measure; and thus furnishes time for reflection;and for the successive deliberations of different bodies,actuated by different motives, and organized upon differentprinciples.§ 276. In the next place, it operates indirectly as apreventive to attempts to carry private, personal, orparty objects, not connected with the common good.The very circumstance, that there exists another bodyclothed with equal power, and jealous of its own rights,and independent of the influence of the leaders, whofavour a particular measure, by whom it must be scanned,and to whom it must be recommended upon its ownmerits, will have a silent tendency to discourage theefforts to carry it by surprise, or by intrigue, or bycorrupt party combinations. It is far less easy to deck.VIII.] THE LEGISLATURE. 203clive, or corrupt, or persuade two bodies into a course,subversive of the general good, than it is one ; especiallyif the elements, of which they are composed, are essentiallydifferent.§ 277. In the next place as legislation necessarilyacts, or may act, upon the whole community, and involvesinterests of vast difficulty and complexity, andrequires nice adjustments, and comprehensive enactments,it is of the greatest consequence to secure anindependent review of it by different minds, actingunder different, and sometimes opposite opinions andfeelings ; so, that it may be as perfect, as human wisdomcan devise. An appellate jurisdiction, therefore,that acts, and is acted upon alternatively, in the exerciseof an independent registry authority, must havethe means, and can scarcely fail to possess the will, togive it a full and satisfactory review. Every one knows,notwithstanding all the guards interposed to secure duedeliberation, how imperfect all human legislation is;how much it embraces of doubtful principle, and of stillmore doubtful utility ; how various, and yet how defective,are its provisions to protect rights, and to redresswrongs. Whatever, therefore, naturally and necessarilyawakens doubt, solicits caution, attracts inquiry, orstimulates vigilance and industry, is of value to aid usagainst precipitancy in framing, or altering laws, as wellas against yielding to the suggestions of indolence, theselfish projects of ambition, or the cunning devices ofcorrupt and hollow demagogues. For this purpose, nobetter expedient has, as yet, been found, than the creationof an independent branch of censors to revise thelegislative enactments of others, and to alter, amend, orreject them at its pleasure, while, in return, its own areto pass through a like ordeal.204 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.§ 278. In the next place, there can scarcely be anyOther adequate security against encroachments uponthe constitutional rights and liberties of the people.Algerian Sidney has said with great force, that the legislativepower is always arbitrary, and not to be trustedin the hands of any, who are not bound to obey thelaws they make. But it is not less true, that it has aconstant tendency to overleap its proper boundaries,from passion, from ambition, from inadvertence, fromthe prevalence of faction, or from the overwhelming influenceof private interests. Under such circumstances,the only effectual barrier against oppression, accidentalor intentional, is to separate its operations, tobalance interest against interest, ambition against ambition,the combinations and spirit of dominion of onebody against the like combinations and spirit of another.And it is obvious, that the more various the elements,which enter into the actual composition of each body,the greater the security will be,^ 279. Such is an outline of the general reasoning,by which the system of a separation of the legislativepower into two branches has been maintained. Experiencehas shown, that if in all cases it has not beenfound a complete check to inconsiderate or unconstitutionallegislation; yet, it has, upon many occasions,been found sufficient for the purpose. There is notprobably at this moment a single state in the Union,which would consent to unite the two branches into oneassembly ; though there have not been wanting at alltimes minds of a high order, which have been led byenthusiasm, or a love of simplicity, or a devotion totheory, to vindicate such a union with arguments, strikingand plausible, if not convincing.CH. VIII.] THE LEGISLATURE. 205§ 280. Having considered the general reasoning, bywhich the division of the legislative power has beenjustified, it may be proper, in conclusion, to give a summaryof those grounds, which were deemed most important,and which had most influence in settling theactual structure of the constitution of the United States.The question of course had reference altogether to theestablishment of the senate ; for no one doubted thepropriety of establishing a house of representatives, asadepositary of the legislative power, however muchany might differ, as to the nature of its composition.§ 281. In order to justify the existence of a senatewith co-ordinate powers, it was said, first, that it is amisfortune incident to republican governments, thoughin a less degree, than to other governments, that those,who administer it, may forget their obligations to theirconstituents, and prove unfaithful to their importanttrust. In this point of view, a senate, as a secondbranch of the legislative assembly, distinct from, anddividing the power with a first, must be in all cases asalutary check on the government. It doubles thesecurity to the people by requiring the concurrence oftwo distinct bodies, in schemes of usurpation or perfidy; whereas the ambition or corruption of one wouldotherwise be sufficient. This precaution, it was added,is founded on such clear principles, and so well understoodin the United States, that it is superfluous\o enlarge on it. As the improbability of sinister combinationswould be in proportion to the dissimilarity inthe genius of the two bodies, it must be politic to distinguishthem from each other by every circumstance,which would consist with a due harmony in all propermeasures, and with the genuine principles of republicangovernment.206 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.§ 282. Secondly. The necessity of a senate isnot less indicated by the propensity of all single andnumerous assemblies to yield to the impulse of suddenand violent passions, and to be seduced by factiousleaders into intemperate and pernicious resolutions.Examples of this sort might be cited withoutnumber, and from proceedings in the United States, aswell as from the history of other nations. A body,which is to correct this infirmity, ought to be free fromit, and consequently ought to be less numerous, and topossess a due degree of firmness, and a proper tenureof office.^ 283. Thirdly. Another defect to be supplied bya senate lies in the want of a due acquaintance with theobjects and principles of legislation. A good governmentimplies two things ; first, fidelity to the objects ofthe government ; secondly, a knowledge of the means,by which those objects can be best attained. It was suggested,that in the American governments too little attentionhad been paid to the last ; and that the establishmentof a senate upon a proper basis would greatlyincrease the chances of fidelity, and of wise and safelegislation. What (it was asked) are all the repealing,explaining, and amending laws, which fill and disgraceour voluminous codes, but so many monuments of deficientwisdom ; so many impeachments exhibitedby each succeeding, against each preceding session;so many admonitions to the people of the value of thosaids, which may be expected from a well-constitutedsenate 7^ 284. Fourthly. Such a body would prevent toogreat a mutability in the public councils, arising from arapid succession of new members ; forfrom a change ofmen there must proceed a change of opinions, and fromCH. VIII.] THE LEGISLATURE. 207a change of opinions, a change of measures. Such instabilityin legislation has a tendency to diminish respectand confidence abroad, as well as safety and prosperityat home. It has a tendency to damp the ardour of industryand enterprise ; to diminish the security of property; and to impair the reverence and attachment,which are indispensable to the permanence of everypolitical institution.§ 285. Fifthly. Another ground, illustrating the utilityof a senate, was suggested to be the keeping alive ofa due sense of national character. In respect to foreignnations, this is of vital importance ; for in our intercoursewith them, if a scrupulous and uniform adherenceto just principles is not observed, it must subjectus to many embarrassments and collisions. It isdifficult to impress upon a single body, which is numerousand changeable, a deep sense of the value of nationalcharacter. A small portion of the praise, orblame of any particular measure can fall to the lot ofany particular person ; and the period of office is soshort, that little responsibility is felt, and little pride isindulged, as to the course of the government.§ 286. Sixthly. It was urged, that, paradoxical asit might seem, the want in some important cases of adue responsibility in the government arises from thatvery frequency of elections, which in other cases producessuch responsibility. In order to be reasonable,responsibility must be limited to objects within thepower of the responsible party ; and in order to beeffectual, it must relate to operations of that power, ofwhich a ready and proper judgment can be formed bythe constituents. Some measures have singly an immediateand sensible operation ; others again depend208 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK HI.on a succession of well conducted schemes, and havea gradual, and perhaps unobserved operation. If, therefore,there be but one assembly, chosen for a short period,it will be difficult to keep up the train of propermeasures, or to preserve the proper connexion betweenthe past and the future. And the more numerous thebody, and the more changeable its component parts,the more difficult it will be to preserve the personalresponsibility, as w^ell as the uniform action, of the successivemembers to the great objects of the publicwelfare.^ 287. Lastly. A senate duly constituted would notonly operate, as a salutary check upon the representatives,but occasionally upon the people themselves,against their own temporary delusions and errors.The cool, deliberate sense of the community ought inall governments, and actually will in all free governments,ultimately prevail over the views of their rulers.But there are particular moments in public affairs, w henthe people, stimulated by some irregular passion, orsome illicit advantage, or misled by the artful misrepresentationsof interested men, may call for measures,which they themselves will afterwards be the mostready to lament and condemn. In these critical moments,how salutary will be the interference of a bodyof respectable citizens, chosen without reference to theexciting cause, to check the misguided career of publicopinion, and to suspend the blow, until reason, justice,and truth can regain their authority over the publicmind. It was thought to add great weight to all theseconsiderations, that history has informed us of no long-livedrepublic, which had not a senate. Sparta, Rome,Carthage were, in fact, the only states, to whom thatcharacter can be applied.CH. VIII.] THE LEGISLATURE. 209§ 288. It will be observed, that some parts of theforegoing reasoning apply to the fundamental importanceof an actual division of the legislative power ; andother parts to the true principles, upon which that divisionshould be subsequently organized, in order togive full effect to the constitutional check. Some partsgo to show the value of a senate ; and others, whatshould be its structure, in order to ensure wisdom, experience,fidelity, and dignity in its members. All ofit, however, instructs us, that, in order to give it fairplay and influence, as a co-ordinate branch of government,it ought to be less numerous, more select, andmore durable, than the other branch ; and be chosen inamanner, which should combine, and represent differentinterests with a varied force. How far these objectsare attained by the constitution will be betterseen, when the details belonging to each departmentare successively examined.Abr. 27210 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.CHAPTER IX.HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.^ 289. The second section of the first article containsthe structure and organization of the house ofrepresentatives. The first clause is as follows :The house of representatives shall be composed ofmembers chosen every second year by the people ofthe several states ; and the electors in each state shall"have the qualifications requisite for electors of themost numerous branch of the state legislature."^ 290. As soon as it was settled, that the legislativepower should be divided into two separate and distinctbranches, a very important consideration arose in regardto the organization of those branches respectively. Itis obvious, that the organization of each is susceptible ofvery great diversities and modifications, in respect tothe principles of representation ; the qualification of theelectors, and the elected ; the term of service of themembers; the ratio of representation; and the number,of which the body should be composed.§ 29 1 . First ; the principle of representation. TheAmerican people had long been in the enjoymentof the privilege of electing, at least, one branch of thelegislature ; and, in some of the colonies, of electing allthe branches composing the legislature. A house ofrepresentatives, under various denominations, such as ahouse of delegates, a house of commons, or, simply, ahouse of representatives, emanating directly from, andresponsible to the people, and possessing a distinct andindependent legislative authority, was familiar to all thecolonies, and was held by them in the highest reverse.IX.] HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 211once and respect. They justly thought, that as thegovernment in general should always have a commoninterest with the people, and be administered for theirgood ; so it was essential to their rights and liberties,that the most numerous branch should have an immediatedependence upon, and sympathy with the people.There was no novelty in this view. It was not themere result of a state of colonial dependence, in whichtheir jealousy was awake to all the natural encroachmentsof power in a foreign realm. They had drawntheir opinions and principles from the practice of theparent country. They knew the inestimable value ofthe house of commons, as a component branch of theBritish parliament; and they believed, that it had atall times furnished the best security against the oppressionsof the crown, and the aristocracy. While thepower of taxation, of revenue, and of supplies, remainedin the hands of a popular branch, it was difficult forusurpation to exist for any length of time without check;and prerogative must yield to that necessity, whichcontrolled at once the sword and the purse. No reasoning,therefore, was necessary to satisfy the Americanpeople of the advantages of a house of representatives,which should emanate direct from themselves ; whichshould guard their interests, support their rights, expresstheir opinions, make known their wants, redresstheir grievances, and introduce a pervading popular influencethroughout all the operations of the government.Experience, as well as theory, had settled it in theirminds, as a fundamental principle of a free government,and especially of a republican government, that no lawsought to be passed without the co-operation and consentof the representatives of the people ; and thatthese representatives should be chosen by themselves,212 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.without the intervention of any other functionaries tointercept, or vary their responsibility.§ 292. We accordingly find, that in the section underconsideration, the house of representatives is requiredto be composed of representatives chosen by the peopleof the several states. The choice, too, is to be madeimmediately by them ; so that the power is direct ; theinfluence direct ; and the responsibility direct. If anyintermediate agency had been adopted, such as a choicethrough an electoral college, or by official personages,or by select and specially qualified functionaries prohac vice, it is obvious, that the dependence of the representativesupon the people, and the responsibility tothem, would have been far less felt, and far more obstructed.Influence would have naturally grown upwith patronage ; and here, as in many other cases, thelegal maxim would have applied, causa proxima nonremota, spectator. The select body would have beenat once the patrons and the guides of the representative; and the people themselves would have becomethe instrument of subverting their own rights and power.§ 293. But this fundamental principle of an immediatechoice by the people, however important, wouldalone be insufficient for the public security, if the rightof choice had not had many auxiliary guards and accompaniments.It was indispensable, secondly, to providefor the qualifications of the electors. It is obvious, thateven when the principle is established, that the popularbranch of the legislature shall emanate directly from thepeople, there still remains a very serious question ; bywhom and in what manner the choice shall be made.It is a question vital to the system, and in a practicalsense decisive, as to the durability and efficiency of thepowers of government. Here, there is much room forCH. IX.] HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 213doubt, and ingenious speculation, and theoretical inquiry; upon which different minds may arrive, and indeedhave arrived, at very different results. To whom oughtthe right of suffrage, in a free government, to be confided? Or, in other words, who ought to be permittedto vote in the choice of the representatives of the people?Ought the right of suffrage to be absolutelyuniversal ? Ought it to be qualified and restrained ?Ought it to belong to many, or few ? If there ought tobe restraints and qualifications, what are the true boundariesand limits of such restraints and qualifications ?^ 294. These questions are sufficiently perplexingand disquieting in theory ; and in the practice of differentstates, and even of free states, ancient as well asmodern, they have assumed almost infinite varieties ofform and illustration. Perhaps they do not admit ofany general, much less of any universal answer, so asto furnish an unexceptionable and certain rule for allages and all nations. The manners, habits, institutions,characters, and pursuits of different nations ; the localposition of the territory, in regard to other nations; theactual organizations and classes of society ; the influencesof peculiar religious, civil, or political institutions ;the dangers, as well as the difficulties, of the times ; thedegrees of knowledge or ignorance pervading the massof society ; the national temperament, and even the climateand products of the soil ; the cold and thoughtfulgravity of the north; and the warm and mercurialexcitability of tropical or southern regions ; all thesemay, and probably will, introduce modifications of principle,as well as of opinion, in regard to the right ofsuffrage, which it is not easy either to justify, or to overthrow.214 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.§ 295. Without laying any stress upon theoreticalreasoning on this subject, it may be proper to state,that every civilized society has uniformly fixed, modified,and regulated the right of suffrage for itself,according to its own free will and pleasure. Everyconstitution of government in these United States hasassumed, as a fundamental principle, the right of thepeople of the state to alter, abolish, and modify the formof its own government, according to the sovereign pleasureof the people. In fact, the people of each statehave gone much farther, and settled a far more criticalquestion, by deciding, who shall be the voters, entidedto approve and reject the constitution framed by a delegatedbody under their direction. In the adoption ofno state constitution has the assent been asked of any,but the qualified voters ; and women, and minors, andother persons, not recognised as voters by existinglaws, have been studiously excluded. And yet theconstitution has been deemed entirely obligatory uponthem, as well as upon the minority, who voted againstit. From this it will be seen, how little, even in themost free of republican governments, any abstract rightof suffrage, or any original and indefeasible privilege,has been recognised in practice. If this considerationdoes not satisfy our minds, it at least will prepare usto presume, that there may be an almost infinite diversityin the established right of voting, without any statebeing able to assert, that its own mode is exclusivelyfounded in natural justice, or is most conformable tosound policy, or is best adapted to the public security.It will teach us, that the question is necessarily complexand intricate in its own nature, and is scarcelysusceptible of any simple solution, which shall rigidlyCH. IX.] HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 215apply to the circumstances and conditions, the interestsand the feelings, the institutions and the mannersof all nations. What may best promote the public weal,and secure the public liberty, and advance the publicprosperity in one age or nation, may totally fail of similarresults under local, physical, or moral predicamentsessentially different.^ 296. It would carry us too far from the immediateobjects of these Commentaries to take a general surveyof the various modifications, under which the right ofsuffrage, either in relation to laws, or magistracy, oreven judicial controversies, has appeared in differentnations in ancient and modern times. The examplesof Greece and Rome in ancient times, and of Englandin modern times, will be found most instructive. InEngland, the qualifications of voters, as also the modesof representation, are various, and framed upon nocommon principle. The counties are represented byknights, elected by the proprietors of lands, who arefreeholders ; the boroughs and cities are representedby citizens and burgesses, or others chosen by thecitizens or burgesses, according to the qualifications prescribedby custom, or by the respective charters andby-laws of each borough, or city. In these, theright of voting is almost infinitely varied and modified.In the American colonies, under their charters andlaws, no uniform rules in regard to the right of suffrageexisted. In some of the colonies the course of theparent country was closely followed, so that freeholdersalone were voters ; in others a very near approachwas made to universal suffrage among the males ofcompetent age ; and in others, again, a middle principlewas adopted, which made taxation and voting dependentupon each other, or annexed to it the qualifiedCONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.cation of holding some personal estate, or the privilegeof being a freeman, or the eldest son of a freeman ofthe town or corporation. When the revolution broughtabout the separation of the colonies, and they formedthemselves into independent states, a very strikingdiversity was observable in the original constitutionsadopted by them ; and a like diversity has pervadedall the constitutions of the new states, which have sincegrown up, and all the revised constitutions of the oldstates, which have received the final ratification of thepeople. In some of the states the right of suffragedepends upon a certain length of residence, and paymentof taxes ; in others, upon mere citizenship andresidence; in others, upon the possession of a freehold,or some estate of a particular value, or upon the paymentof taxes, or performance of some public duty,such as service in the militia, or on the highways.In no two of these state constitutions will it be found,that the qualifications of the voters are seeded upon thesame uniform basis. So that we have the mostabundant proofs, that among a free and enlightenedpeople, convened for the purpose of establishing theirown forms of government, and the rights of their ownvoters, the question, as to the due regulation of thequalifications, has been deemed a matter of mere statepolicy, and varied to meet the wants, to suit the prejudices,and to foster the interests of the majority. Anabsolute, indefeasible right to elect, or be elected,seems never to have been asserted on one side, ordenied on the other ; but the subject has been freelycanvassed, as one of mere civil polity, to be arrangedupon such a basis, as the majority might deem expedientwith reference to the moral, physical, and intellectualcondition of the particular state.CH, IX.] HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 217^ 297. It was under this known diversity of constitutionalprovisions in regard to state elections, that theconvention, which framed the constitution of the Union,was assembled. The definition of the right of suffrageis very justly regarded, as a fundamental article of arepublican government. It was incumbent on theconvention, therefore, to define and establish this rightin the constitution. To have left it open for the occasionalregulation of congress would have been improper,for the reason just mentioned. To have submitted itto the legislative discretion of the states would havebeen improper for the same reason, and for the additionalreason, that it would have rendered too dependenton the state governments that branch of the federalgovernment, which ought to be dependent on thepeople alone. Two modes of providing for the rightof suffrage in the choice of representatives were presentedto the consideration of that body. One was todevise some plan, which should operate uniformly in allthe states, on a common principle ; the other was toconform to the existing diversities in the states, thuscreating a mixed mode of representation. In favour ofthe former course, it might be urged, that all the statesought, upon the floor of the house of representatives,to be represented equally; that this could be accomplishedonly by the adoption of a uniform qualificationof the voters, who would thus express the same publicopinion of the same body of citizens throughout theUnion ; that, if freeholders alone in one state chose therepresentatives, and in another all male citizens ofcompetent age, and in another all freemen of particulartowns or corporations, and in another all taxedinhabitants, it would be obvious, that different interestsand classes would obtain exclusive representationsAbr. 2S218 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.in different states ; and thus the great object of theconstitution, the promotion of the general welfare andcommon defence, might be unduly checked and obstructed; that a uniform principle would at least havethis recommendation, that it could create no well-foundedjealousies among the different states, andwould be most likely to satisfy the body of the peopleby its perfect fairness, its permanent equality of operation,and its entire independence of all local legislation,whether in the shape of state laws, or of amendmentsto state constitutions.^ 298. On the other hand, it might be urged in favourof the latter course, that the reducing of the differentqualifications, already existing in the different states,to one uniform rule, would have been a very difficulttask, even to the convention itself, and would be dissatisfactoryto the people of different states. It wouldnot be very easy for the convention to frame any rule,which would satisfy the scruples, the prejudices, or thejudgments of a majority of its own members. It wouldnot be easy to induce Virginia to give up the exclusiveright of freeholders to vote ; or Rhode-island, or Connecticut,the exclusive right of freemen to vote; orMassachusetts, the right of persons possessing a givenvalue of personal property to vote ; or other states, theright of persons paying taxes, or having a fixed residence,to vote. The subject itself was not susceptible of anyvery exact limitations upon any general reasoning. Thecircumstances of different states might create great diversitiesin the practical operation of any uniform system.And the natural attachments, which long habit an(usage had sanctioned, in regard to the exercise of th(right, would enlist all the feelings, and interests, an(opinions of every state against any substantial changeCH. IX.] HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 219in its own institutions. A great embarrassment wouldbe thus thrown in the way of the adoption of the constitutionitself, which perhaps would thus be put at hazard,upon the mere ground of theoretical propriety.^ 299. In the judgment of the convention, this latterreasoning seems to have obtained a decisive influence,and to have established the final result ; and it was accordinglydeclared, in the clause under consideration,that " the electors in each state shall have the qualificationsrequisite for electors of the most numerous branchof the state legislature." Upon this clause (which wasfinally adopted by a unanimous vote) the Federalist hasremarked, " the provision made by the convention appearsto be the best, that lay within their option. It mustbe satisfactory to every state, because it is conformableto the standard already established by the state itself. Itwill be safe to the United States, because, being fixedby the state constitutions, it is not alterable by thestate governments ; and it cannot be feared, that thepeople of the states will alter this part of their constitutionsin such a manner, as to abridge the rights securedto them by the federal constitution."^ 300. In the third place, the term of service ofrepresentatives. In order to ensure permanent safety tothe liberties of the people, other guards are indispensable,besides those, which are derived from the exercise ofthe right of suffrage and representation. If, when the legislatureis once chosen, it is perpetual, or may last duringthe life of the representatives; and in case of death, or resignationonly, the vacancy is to be supplied by the electionof new representatives ; it is easy to perceive, thatin such cases there will be but a very slight check upontheir acts, on the part of the people. In such cases,if the legislative body should be once corrupted, the evil220 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.would be past all remedy, at least without some violentrevolution, or extraordinary calamity. But, when differentlegislative bodies are to succeed each other atshort intervals, if the people disapprove of the present,they may rectify its faults, by the silent exercise of theirpower in the succeeding election. Besides ; a legislativeassembly, which is sure to be separated again, andits members soon return to private Hfe, will feel its owninterests, as well as duties, bound up with those of thecommunity at large. It may, therefore, be safely laiddown as a fundamental axiom of republican governments,that there must be a dependence on, and responsibilityto, the people, on the part of the representative,which shall constantly exert an influence uponhis acts and opinions, and produce a sympathy betweenhim and his constituents. If, when he is once elected,he holds his place for life, or during good behaviour, orfor a long period of years, it is obvious, that there willbe little effective control exercised upon him ; and hewill soon learn to disregard the wishes, the interests,and even the rights of his constituents, whenever theyinterfere with his own selfish pursuits and objects.When appointed, he may not, indeed, consider himself,as exclusively their representative, bound by their opinions,and devoted to their peculiar local interests,although they may be wholly inconsistent with the goodof the Union. He ought rather to deem himself a representativeof the nation, and bound to provide for thegeneral welfare, and to consult for the general safety.But still in a just sense, he ought to feel his responsibilityto them, and to act for them in common with therest of the people; and to deem himself, in an emphaticmanner, their defender, and their friend.CH. IX.] HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 221^301. Frequent elections are unquestionably thesoundest, if not the sole policy, by which this dependenceand sympathy and responsibility can be effectuallysecured. But the question, what degree of frequencyis best calculated to accomplish that object, is notsusceptible of any precise and universal answer, andmust essentially depend upon very different considerationsin different nations, and vary with their size, theirage, their condition, their institutions, and their localpeculiarities.§ 302. Without pretending to go into a completesurvey of the subject in all its bearings, the frequencyof elections may be materially affected, as matter ofpolicy, by the extent of the population and territory ofa country, the concentration or coarseness of the population,the nature of the pursuits, and employments, andengagements of the people; and by the local and poeticalsituation of the nation in regard to contiguous nations.If the government be of small extent, or be concentratedin a single city, it will be far more easy forthe citizens to choose their rulers frequently, and tochange them without mischief, than it would be, if theterritory were large, the population sparse, and the meansof intercourse few, and liable to interruption. If all theinhabitants, who are to vote, reside in towns and villages,there will be little inconvenience in assembling them togetherat a short notice to make a choice. It will be farotherwise, if the inhabitants are scattered over a largeterritory, and are engaged in agricultural pursuits, like theplanters and farmers of the southern and western states,who must meet at a distance from their respective homes,and at some common place of assembling. In cases ofthis sort, the sacrifice of time necessary to accomplish222 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.the object, the expenses of the journey, the imperfectmeans of communication, the slow progress of interchangesof opinion, would naturally diminish the exerciseof the right of suffrage. There would be greatdanger, under such circumstances, that there wouldgrow up a general indifference or inattention to elections,if they were frequent, since they would createlittle interest, and would involve heavy charges andburthens. The nature of the pursuits and employmentsof the people must also have great influence in settlingthe question. If the mass of the citizens are engagedin employments, which take them away for a long periodfrom home, such as employment in the whale andcod fisheries, in the fur trade, in foreign and distantcommerce, in periodical caravans, or in other pursuits,which require constant attention, or long continued laboursat particular seasons; it is obvious, that frequentelections, which should interfere with their primary interestsand objects, would be at once inconvenient, oppressive,and unequal. They would enable the few toobtain a complete triumph and ascendency in the affairsof the state over the many. Besides ; the frequencyof elections must be subject to other considerations,affecting the general comfort and convenience, as wellof rulers, as of electors. In the bleak regions of Lapland,and the farther north, and in the sultry and protractedheats of the south, a due regard must be had to thehealth of the inhabitants, and to the ordinary means oftravelling. If the territory be large, the representativesmust come from great distances, and are liable to beretarded by all the varieties of climate, and geologicalfeatures of the country ; by drifts of impassable snows ;by sudden inundations ; by chains of mountains ; byextensive prairies ; by numerous streams ; by sandydeserts.CH. IX.] HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 223§ 303. The task of legislation, too, is exceedinglydifferent in a small state, from what it is in a large one ;in a state engaged in a single pursuit, or living in pastoralsimplicity, from what it is in a state engaged inthe infinitely varied employments of agriculture, manufacture,and commerce, where enterprise and capitalrapidly circulate and new legislation is constantly requiredby the new fortunes of society. A single weekmight suffice for the ordinary legislation of a state ofthe territorial extent of Rhode-island; while severalmonths would scarcely suffice for that of New-york,In Great-britain a half year is consumed in legislationfor its diversified interests and occupations; while aweek would accomplish all, that belongs to that of Laplandor of Greenland, of the narrow republic of Geneva,or of the subordinate principalities of Germany. Athensmight legislate, without obstructing the daily course ofcommon business, for her own meagre territory ; butwhen Rome had become the mistress of the world, theyear seemed too short for all the exigencies of hersovereignty. When she deliberated for a world, shefelt, that legislation, to be wise or safe, must be slowand cautious ; that knowledge, as well as power, wasindispensable for the just government of her provinces.^ 304. Again ; the local position of a nation in regardto other nations may require very different coursesof legislation, and very different intervals of elections,from what would be dictated by a sense of its own interestand convenience under other circumstances. Ifit is surrounded by powerful and warlike neighbours, itsown government must be invested with proportionatelyprompt means to act, and to legislate, in order to repelaggressions, and secure its own rights. Frequent224 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.changes in the public councils might not only leave itexposed to the hazard of having no efficient body inexistenceto act upon any sudden emergency, but also,by the fluctuations of opinion, necessarily growing outof these changes, introduce imbecility, irresolution, andthe want of due information into those councils. Men,to act with vigour and effect, must have time to maturemeasures, and judgment and experience, as to the bestmethod of applying them. They must not be hurriedon to their conclusions by the passions, or the fears ofthe multitude. They must deliberate, as well as resolve.If the power drops from their hands beforethe* have an opportunity to carry any system into fulleffect, or even to put it on its trials it is impossible, thatforeign nations should not be able, by intrigues, byfalse alarms, and by corrupt influences, to defeat thewisest measures of the best patriots.^ 305. One other consideration of a general naturedeserves attention. It is, that while, on the one hand,constantly recurring elections afibrd a great security topublic liberty, they are not, on the other hand, withoutsome dangers and inconveniences of a formidable nature.The very frequency of elections has a tendencyto create agitations and dissensions in the publicmind ; to nourish factions, and encourage restlessness ;to favour rash innovations in domestic legislation andpublic policy; and to produce violent and suddenchanges in the administration of public affairs, foundedupon temporary excitements and prejudices.§ 306. It is plain, that some of the considerations,which have been stated, must apply with very differentforce to the condition and interests of different states ;and they demonstrate, if not the absurdity, at least theimpolicy of laying down any general maxim, as to theCH. IX.] HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 225frequency of elections to legislative, or other offices.There is quite as much absurdity in laying down, as ageneral rule, that where annual elections end, tyrannybegins, as there is in saying, that the people are free,only while they are choosing their representatives, andslaves during the whole period of their service.§ 307. The reasons, which finally prevailed in theconvention and elsewhere in favour of biennial electionsin preference to any other period, may be arranged underthe following heads :^ 308. In the first place, an argument may properlybe drawn from the extent of the country to begoverned. The territorial extent of the United Stateswill require the representatives to travel from f greatdistances ; and the arrangements, rendered necessaryby that circumstance, will furnish much more seriousobjections with men fit for this service, if limited to asingle year, than if extended to two years. Annualelections might be very well adapted to the state legislaturesfrom the facility of convening the members, andfrom the familiarity of the people with all the generalobjects of local legislation, when they would be highlyinconvenient for the legislature of the Union. If, whenconvened, the term of congress were of short duration,there would scarcely be time properly to examine andmature measures. A new election might intervene beforethere had been an opportunity to interchangeopinions and acquire the information indispensable forwise and salutary action. Much of the business of thenational legislature must necessarily be postponed beyonda single session ; and if new men are to comeevery year, a great part of the information already accumulatedwill be lost, or be unavoidably open for re-examinationbefore any vote can be properly had.Abr. 29226 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.§ 309. In the next place, however well foundedthe maxim may be, that where no other circumstancesaffect the case, the greater the power is, the shorterought to be its duration ; and conversely, the smallerthe power, the more safely its duration may be protracted; that maxim, if it applies at all to the governmentof the Union, is favorable to the extension ofthe period of service beyond that of the state legislatures.The powers of congress are few and limited,and of a national character ; those of the state legislaturesare general, and have few positive limitations. Ifannual elections are safe for a state ; biennial electionswould not be less safe for the United States. No justobjection, then, could arise from this source, upon anynotion, that there would be a more perfect security forpublic liberty in annual than in biennial elections.^310. But a far more important consideration growsout of the nature and objects of the powers of congress.The aim of every political constitution is, or ought tobe, first, to obtain for rulers men, who possess mostwisdom to discern, and most virtue to pursue, the commongood of society ; and, in the next place, to takethe most effectual precautions for keeping them virtuous,whilst they continue to hold their public trust.Frequent elections have, without question, a tendencyto accomplish the latter object. But too great a frequencywill, almost invariably, defeat the former object,and, in most cases, put at hazard the latter. As hasbeen already intimated, it has a tendency to introducefaction, and rash counsels, and passionate appeals tothe prejudices, rather than to the sober judgment ofthe people. And we need not to be reminded, thatfaction and enthusiasm are the instruments, by whichpopular governments are destroyed. It operates also,CH. IX.] HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 227as a great discouragement upon suitable candidatesoffering themselves for the public service. They canhave little opportunity to establish a solid reputation, asstatesmen or patriots, when their schemes are liable tobe suddenly broken in upon by demagogues, who maycreate injurious suspicions, and even displace them fromoffice, before their measures are fairly tried. And theyare apt to grow weary of continued appeals to vindicatetheir character and conduct at the polls, since success,however triumphant, is of such short duration, andconfidence is so easily loosened. These considerations,which are always of some weight, are especially applicableto services in a national legislature, at a distancefrom the constituents, and in cases, where a great varietyof information, not easily accessible, is indispensableto a right understanding of the conduct and votes ofrepresentatives.§ 311. But the very nature and objects of the nationalgovernment require far more experience andknowledge, than what may be thought requisite in themembers of a state legislature. For the latter a knowledgeof local interests and opinions may ordinarily suffice.But it is far different with a member of congress.He is to legislate for the interest and welfare, not ofone state only, but of all the states. It is not enough,that he comes to the task with an upright intention andsound judgment, but he must have a competent degreeof knowledge of all the subjects, on which he is calledto legislate ; and he must have skill, as to the best modeof applying it. The latter can scarcely be acquired, butby long experience and training in the national councils.The period of service ought, therefore, to bearsome proportion to the variety of knowledge and practicalskill, which the duties of the station demand.228 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.§ 312. And this leads us naturally to another remark ;and that is, that a due exercise of some of the powersconfided to the house of representatives, even in itsmost narrow functions, require, that the members shouldat least be elected for a period of two years. The powerof impeachment could scarcely be exerted with effectby any body, which had not a legislative life of such aperiod. It would scarcely be possible, in ordinarycases, to begin and end an impeachment at a single annualsession. And the effect of a change of membersduring its prosecution would be attended with no inconsiderableembarrassment and inconvenience. If thepower is ever to be exerted, so as to bring great offendersto justice, there must be a prolonged legislativeterm of office, so as to meet the exigency. One yearwill not suffice to detect guilt, and to pursue it to conviction.§ 313. Again; the house of representatives is to bethesole judge of the elections of its own members.Now, if but one legislative session is to be held in ayear, and more than one cannot ordinarily be presumedconvenient or proper, spurious elections cannot be investigatedand annulled in time to have a due effect.The sitting member must either hold his seat duringthe whole period of the investigation, or he must besuspended during the same period. In either case thepublic mischief will be very great. The uniform practicehas been to allow the member, who is returned, tohold his seat and vote, until he is displaced by the orderof the house, after full investigation. If, then, areturn can be obtained, no matter by what means, theirregular member is sure of holding his seat, until along period has elapsed, (for that is indispensable toany thorough investigation of facts arising at great discs.IX.] HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 229dances ;) and thus a very pernicious encouragement isgiven to the use of unlawful means for obtaining irregularreturns, and fraudulent elections.§ 314. There is one other consideration, not withoutits weight in all questions of this nature. Where electionsare very frequent, a few of the members, as happensin all such assemblies, will possess superior talents;will, by frequent re-elections, become members of longstanding; will become thoroughly masters of the publicbusiness ; and thus will acquire a preponderating andundue influence, of which they will naturally be disposedto avail themselves. The great bulk of the housewill be composed of new members, who will necessarilybe inexperienced, diffident, and undisciplined, andthus be subjected to the superior ability and informationof the veteran legislators. If biennial electionswould have no more cogent effect, than to diminish theamount of this inequality ; to guard unsuspecting confidenceagainst the snares, which may be set for it ; andto stimulate a watchful and ambitious responsibility, itwould have a decisive advantage over mere annualelections.^315. Such were some of the reasons, which produced,on the part of the framers of the constitution,and ultimately of the people themselves, an approbationof biennial elections. Experience has demonstratedthe sound policy and wisdom of the provision. Butlooking back to the period, when the constitution wasupon its passage, one cannot but be struck with thealarms, with which the public mind was on this subjectattempted to be disturbed. It was repeatedly urgedin and out of the state conventions, that biennial electionswere dangerous to the public liberty ; and thatcongress might perpetuate itself, and reign with absolutepower over the nation.230 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.§ 3 1 6. In the next place, as to the qualifications ofthe elected. The constitution on this subject is asfollows : " No person shall be a representative, whoshall not have attained to the age of twenty-five years,and been seven years a citizen of the United States ;** and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of*' that state, in which he shall be chosen."§ 317. It is obvious, that the inquiry, as to the duequalifications of representatives, like that, as to the duequalifications of electors in a government, is susceptible,in its own nature, of very different answers, accordingto the habits, institutions, interests, and local peculiaritiesof different nations. It is a point, upon which wecan arrive at no universal rule, which will accommodateitself to the welfare and wants of every people, with thesame proportionate advantages. The great objects are,or ought to be, to secure, on the part of the representatives,fidelity, sound judgment, competent information,and incorruptible independence. The best modes, bywhich these objects can be attained, are matters of discussionand reasoning, and essentially dependent upona large and enlightened survey of the human characterand passions, as developed in the different stages ofcivilized society. There is great room, therefore, fordiversities of judgment and opinion upon a subject socomprehensive and variable in its elements. It wouldbe matter of surprise, if doctrines essentially different,nay, even opposite to each other, should not, undersuch circumstances, be maintained by political writers,equally eminent and able. Upon questions of civilpolicy, and the fundamental structure of governments,there has hitherto been too hide harmony of opinionamong the greatest men to encourage any hope, thatthe future will be less fruitful in dissonances, than theCH. IX.] HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 231past. In the practice of governments, a very greatdiversity of qualifications has been insisted on, as prerequisitesof office ; and this alone would demonstrate,that there is not admitted to exist any common standardof superior excellence, adapted to all ages, and allnations.^318. Among the American colonies antecedent tothe revolution, a great diversity of qualifications existed ;and the state constitutions, subsequently formed, by nomean lessen that diversity. Some insist upon a freehold,or other property, of a certain value ; others requirea certain period of residence, and citizenship only ;others require a freehold only ; others a payment oftaxes, or an equivalent ; others, again, mix up all thevarious qualifications of property, residence, citizenship,and taxation, or substitute some of these, as equivalentsfor others.^319. The existing qualifications in the states beingthen so various, it may be thought, that the best coursev^ould have been, to adopt the rules of the states respectively,in regard to the most numerous branch oftheir own legislatures. And this course might not havebeen open to serious objections. But, as the qualificationsof members were thought to be less carefully definedin the state constitutions, and more susceptible ofuniformity, than those of the electors, the subject wasthought proper for regulation by the convention. Andit is observable, that the positive qualifications are fewand simple. They respect only age, citizenship, andinhabitancy.§ 320. First, in regard to age. The representativemust have attained twenty-five years. And certainlyto this no reasonable objection can be made. If experience,or wisdom, or knowledge, be of value in the CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.national councils, it Cctn scarcely be pretended, that anearlier age could afford a certain guaranty for either.That some qualification of age is proper, no one willdispute. No one will contend, that persons, who areminors, ought to be eligible ; or, that those, who havenot attained manhood, so as to be entitled by the commonlaw to dispose of their persons, or estates, at theirown will, would be fit depositaries of the authority todispose of the rights, persons, and property of others.Would the mere attainment of twenty-one years of agebe a more proper qualification ? All just reasoningwould be against it. The characters and passions ofyoung men can scarcely be understood at the momentof their majority. They are then new to the rights ofself-government ; warm in their passions ; ardent intheir expectations ; and, just escaping from pupilage,are strongly tempted to discard the lessons of caution,which riper years inculcate. What they will become,remains to be seen ; and four years beyond that periodis but a very short space, in which to try their virtues,developed their talents, enlarge their resources, and givethem a practical insight into the business of life adequateto their own immediate wants and duties. Canthe interests of others be safely confided to those, whohave yet to learn, how to take care of their own 7 TheBritish constitution has, indeed, provided only for themembers of the house of commons not being minors ;and illustrious instances have occurred to show, thatgreat statesmen may be formed even during their minority.But such instances are rare ; they are to belooked at as prodigies, rather than as examples ; as theextraordinary growth of a peculiar education and character,and a hot-bed precocity, in a monarchy, ratherthan as the sound and thrifty growth of the open air,CH. IX.] HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 233and the bracing hardihood of a republic. In the conventionthis qualification, as to age, did not pass withouta struggle. It was originally carried by a vote of sevenstates against three, one being divided ; though it wasultimately adopted without a division. In the stateconventions it does not seem to have formed any importanttopic of debate.^321. Secondly, in regard to citizenship. It is required,that the representative shall have been a citizenof the United States seven years. Upon the proprietyof excluding aliens from eligibility, there couldscarcely be any room for debate ; for there could be nosecurity for a due administration of any government bypersons, whose interests and connexions where foreign,and who owed no permanent allegiance to it, and hadno permanent stake in its measures or operations. Foreigninfluence, of the most corrupt and mischievousnature, could not fail to make its way into the publiccouncils, if there were no guard against the introductionof alien representatives. It has accordingly been a fundamentalpolicy of most, if not of all free states, to excludeall foreigners from holding offices in the state.The only practical question would seem to be, whetherforeigners, even after naturalization, should be eligibleas representatives ; and if so, what is a suitable periodof citizenship for the allowance of the privilege. InEngland, all aliens born, unless naturalized, were originallyexcluded from a seat in parliament ; and now, bypositive legislation, no alien, though naturalized, is capableof being a member of either house of parliament.A different course, naturally arising from the circumstancesof the country, was adopted in the Americancolonies antecedent to the revolution, with a view toinvite emigrations, and settlements, and thus to facilitateAbr. 30234 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.the cultivation of their wild and waste lands. A similarpolicy had since pervaded the state governments, andhad been attended with so many advantages, that itwould have been impracticable to enforce any total exclusionof naturalized citizens from office. In the conventionit was originally proposed, that three years'citizenship should constitute a qualification ; but thatwas exchanged for seven years by a vote of ten statesto one. No objection seems even to have been suggestedagainst this qualification ; and hitherto it hasobtained a general acquiescence or approbation. Itcertainly subserves two important purposes. 1. Thatthe constituents have a full opportunity of knowing thecharacter and merits of their representative. 2. Thatthe representative has a like opportunity of learningthe character, and wants, and opinions of his constituents.§ 322. Thirdly, in regard to inhabitancy. It is required,that the representative shall, when elected, beaninhabitant of the state, in which he shall be chosen.The object of this clause, doubdess, was to secure anattachment to, and a just representation of, the interestsof the state in the national councils. It was supposed,that an inhabitant would feel a deeper concern,and possess a more enlightened view of the variousinterests of his constituents, than a mere stranger. And,at all events, he would generally possess more entirelytheir sympathy and confidence. It is observable, thatthe inhabitancy required is within the state, and notwithin any particular district of the state, in w which themember is chosen. In England, in former times, itwas required, that all the members of the house ofcommons should be inhabitants of the places, for whichthey were chosen. But this was for a long time whollyCH. IX.] HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 235disregarded in practice, and was at length repealed bystatute of 14 Geo. 3, ch. 58. This circumstance is notalitde remarkable in parliamentary history ; and it establishes,in a very striking manner, how Httle meretheory can be regarded in matters of government. Itwas found by experience, that boroughs and cities wereoften better represented by men of eminence, andknown patriotism, who were strangers to them, thanby those chosen from their own vicinage. And to thisvery hour some of the proudest names in English history,as patriots and statesmen, have been the representativesof obscure, and, if one may so say, of ignobleboroughs.^ 323. It has been justly observed, that under thereasonable qualifications established by the constitution,the door of this part of the federal government is opento merit of every description, whether native or adoptive,whether young or old, and without regard to povertyor wealth, or any particular profession of religiousfaith.§ 324. The next clause of the second section of thefirst article respects the apportionment of the representativesamong the states. It is as follows: "Representativesand direct taxes shall be apportioned among"the several states, which may be included in thisUnion, according to their respective numbers, whichshall be determined by adding to the whole number offree persons, including those bound to service for aterm of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifthsof all other persons. The actual enumerationshall be made within three years after the first meetingof the congress of the United States, and within"every subsequent term of ten years, in such manneras they shall, by law, direct. The number of repressCONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [book III.tentative shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand; but each state shall have at least one representative.And until such enumeration shall be made,the state of New-hampshire shall be enticed to choose"three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode-island and ProvidencePlantations one, Connecticut five, New-york"six, New-jersey four, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware"one, Maryland six, Virginia ten. North Carolina five,South-carolina five, and Georgia three."§ 325. The first apportionment thus made, being of atemporary and fugacious character, requires no commentary.The basis assumed was probably very nearlythe same, which the constitution pointed out for allfuture apportionment, or, at least, of all the free personsin the states.It is obvious, that the question, how the apportionmentshould be made, was one, upon which a considerablediversity of judgment might, and probably would,exist. Three leading principles of apportionment would,at once, present themselves. One was to adopt the rulealready existing under the confederation ; that is, anequality of representation and vote by each state, thusgiving each state a right to send not less than two, normore than seven representatives, and in the determinationof questions, each state to have one vote. Thiswould naturally receive encouragement from all those,who were attached to the confederation, and preferreda mere league of states, to a government in any degreenational. And accordingly it formed, as it should seem,the basis of what was called the New-jersey Plan.This rule of apportionment met, however, with a decidedopposition, and was negatived in the convention atan early period, seven states voting against it, three beingin its favour, and one being divided.CH. IX.] HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 237^ 326. Another principle might be, to apportion therepresentation of the states according to the relativeproperty of each, thus making property the basis ofrepresentation. This might commend itself to somepersons, because it would introduce a salutary checkinto the legislature in regard to taxation, by securing,in some measure, an equalization of the public burthens,by the voice of those, who were called to give most towardsthe common contributions. That taxation oughtto go hand in hand with representation had been a favouritetheory of the American people. Under the confederation,all the common expenses were required tobe borne by the states in proportion to the value ofthe land within each state. But it has been alreadyseen, that this mode of contribution was extremely difficultand embarrassing, and unsatisfactory in practice,under the confederation. There do not, indeed,seem to be any traces in the proceedings of the convention,that this scheme had an exclusive influence withany persons in that body. It mixed itself up with otherconsiderations, without acquiring any decisive preponderance.In the first place, it was easy to provide a remedialcheck upon undue direct taxation, the only species,of which there could be the slightest danger of unequaland oppressive levies. And it will be seen, that thiswas sufficiently provided for, by declaring, that representativesand direct taxes should be apportioned bythe same ratio.^ 327. In the next jjace, although property may notbe directly aimed at, as a basis in the representation,provided for by the constitution, it cannot, on the otherhand, be deemed to be totally excluded, as will presentlybe seen. In the next place, it is not admitted, thatproperty alone can, in a free government, safely be CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.lied on, as the sole basis of representation. It may betrue, and probably is, that, in the ordinary course ofaffairs, it is not the interest, or policy of those, whopossess property, to oppress those, who want it. But, inevery well-ordered commonwealth, persons, as well asproperty, should possess a just share of influence. Theliberties of the people are too dear, and too sacred, to beentrusted to any persons, who may not, at all times,have a common sympathy and common interest withthe people in the preservation of their public rights,privileges, and liberties. Checks and balances, if notindispensable to, are at least a great conservative in, theoperations of all free governments. And, perhaps, uponmere abstract theory, it cannot be justly affirmed, thateither persons or property, numbers or wealth, cansafely be trusted, as the final repositories of the delegatedpowers of government. By apportioning influenceamong each, vigilance, caution, and mutual checksare naturally introduced, and perpetuated.^ 328. The third and remaining principle was, toapportion the representatives among the states accordingto their relative numbers. This had the recommendationof great simplicity and uniformity in its operation,of being generally acceptable to the people, andof being less Table to fraud and evasion, than any other,which could be devised. Besides ; although wealthand property cannot be affirmed to be in differentstates exactly in proportion to the numbers ; they arenot so widely separated from it, as, at a hasty glance,might be imagined. There is, if not a natural, at least avery common connexion between them ; and, perhaps,an apportionment of taxes according to numbers is asequitable a rule for contributions according to relativewealth, as any, which can be practically obtained.CH. IX.] HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 239§ 329. The scheme, therefore, under all the circumstances,of making numbers the basis of the representationof the Union, seems to have obtained more generalfavour, than any other in the convention, because ithad a natural and universal connexion with the rightsand liberties of the whole people.§ 330. But here a difficulty of a very serious naturearose. There were other persons in several of thestates, than those, who were free. There were somepersons, who were bound to service for a term of years ;though these were so few, that they would scarcelyvary the result of the general rule, in any important degree.There were Indians, also, in several, and probablyin most, of the states at that period, who were nottreated as citizens, and yet, who did not form a part ofindependent communities or tribes, exercising generalsovereignty and powers of government within the boundariesof the states. It was necessary, therefore, to providefor these cases, though they were attended with nopractical difficulty. There seems not to have been anyobjection to including, in the ratio of representation, personsbound to service for a term of years, and to excludingIndians not taxed. The real (and it was avery exciting) controversy was in regard to slaves,whether they should be included in the enumeration,or not.§ 331. The truth is, that the arrangement adoptedby the constitution was a matter of compromise andconcession, confessedly unequal in its operation, but anecessary sacrifice to that spirit of conciliation, whichwas indispensable to the union of states having a greatdiversity of interests, and physical condition, and politicalinstitutions. It was agreed, that slaves should berepresented under the mild appellation of " other CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.sons," not as free persons, but only in the proportion ofthree fifths. In order to reconcile the non-slaveholdersstates to this provision, another clause was inserted,that direct taxes should be apportioned in the samemanner as representatives. So, that, theoretically, representationand taxation might go pari passu. Thisprovision, however, is more specious than solid ; forwhile, in the levy of direct taxes, it apportions them onthree fifths of persons not free, it, on the other hand,really exempts the other two fifths from being taxed atall, as property. Whereas, if direct taxes had beenapportioned, as upon principle they ought to be, accordingto the real value of property within the state, thewhole of the slaves would have been taxable, as property.But a far more striking inequality has been disclosedby the practical operations of the government.The principle of representation is constant, and uniform ;the levy of direct taxes is occasional, and rare. In thecourse of forty years, no more than three direct taxeshave been levied ; and those only under very extraordinaryand pressing circumstances. The ordinary expendituresof the government are, and always havebeen, derived from other sources. Imposts upon foreignimportations have supplied, and will generally supply,all the common wants; and if these should notfurnish an adequate revenue, excises are next resortedto, as the surest and most convenient mode of taxation.Direct taxes constitute the last resort ; and (as mighthave been foreseen) would never be laid, until otherresources had failed.^ 332. Viewed in its proper light, as a real compromise,in a case of conflicting interests, for the commongood, the provision is entitled to great praise forits moderation, its aim at practical utility, and its tench.IX.] HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 241deny to satisfy the people, that the Union, framed byall, ought to be dear to all, by the privileges it confers,as well as the blessings it secures. It had a materialinfluence in reconciling the southern states to otherprovisions in the constitution, and especially to thepower of making commercial regulations by a meremajority, which was thought peculiarly to favour thenorthern states. It has sometimes been complainedof, as a grievance ; but he, who wishes well to his country,will adhere steadily to it, as a fundamental policy,which extinguishes some of the most mischievoussources of all political divisions, — those founded ongeographical positions, and domestic institutions.^ 333. Another part of the clause regards the periods,at which the enumeration or census of the inhabitantsof the United States shall be taken, in order toprovide for new apportionment of representatives, accordingto the relative increase of the population of thestates. Various propositions for this purpose were laid,at different times, before the convention. It was proposedto have the census taken once in fifteen years, andin twenty years ;• but the vote finally prevailed in favourof ten. The importance of this provision for a decennialcensus can scarcely be overvalued. It is theonly effectual means, by which the relative powder of theseveral states could be justly represented. If the systemfirst established had been unalterable, very grossinequalities would soon have taken place among thestates, from the very unequal increase of their population.The representation would soon have exhibited asystem very analogous to that of the house of commons,in Great-britain, where old and decayed boroughs sendrepresentatives, not only wholly disproportionate to theirimportance, but in some cases, with scarcely a singleAbr. 31242 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.inhabitant, they match the representatives of the mostpopulous counties.§ 334. In regard to the United States, the slightestexamination of the apportionment made under the firstthree censuses will demonstrate this conclusion in avery striking manner. The representation of Delawareremains, as it was at the first apportionment ; thatof New-hampshire, Rhode-island, Connecticut, New-jersey,and Maryland has had but a small comparativeincrease ; whilst that of Massachusetts (including Maine)has swelled from eight to twenty ; that of New-york,from six to thirty-four ; and that of Pennsylvania, fromeight to twenty-six. In the mean time, the new stateshave sprung into being ; and Ohio, which in 1803 wasonly entitled to one, now counts fourteen representatives.The census of 1831 exhibits still more strikingresults. In 1790, the whole population of the UnitedStates was about three millions nine hundred andtwenty-nine thousand; and in 1830, it was abouttwelve millions eight hundred and fifty-six thousand.Ohio, at this very moment, contains at least one million,and New York two millions of inhabitants. Thesefacts show the wisdom of the provision for a decennialapportionment ; and, indeed, it would otherwise havehappened, that the system, however sound at the beginning,would by this time have been productive of grossabuses, and probably have engendered feuds and discontents,of themselves sufficient to have occasioned adissolution of the Union. We probably owe this provisionto those in the convention, who were in favour ofa national government, in preference to a mere confederationof states.^ 335. The next part of the clause relates to thetotal number of the house of representatives. It deck.IX.] HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 243cares, that " the number of representatives shall notexceed one for every thirty thousand." This vias asubject of great interest ; and it has been asserted, thatscarcely any article of the whole constitution seems tobe rendered more worthy of attention by the weight ofcharacter, and the apparent force of argument, withwhich it was originally assailed. The number fixedby the constitution to constitute the body in thefirst instance, and until a census was taken, was sixty-five.^ 336. Several objections were urged against theprovision. First, that so small a number of representativeswould be an unsafe depositary of the public interests.Secondly, that they would not possess aproper knowledge of the local circumstances of theirnumerous constituents. Thirdly, that they would betakenfrom that class of citizens, which would sympathizeleast with the feelings of the people, and be mostlikely to aim at a permanent elevation of the few, onthe depression of the many. Fourthly, that defective,as the number in the first instance would be, it wouldbe more and more disproportionate by the increase ofthe population, and the obstacles, which would preventa correspondent increase of the representatives.§ 337. Time and experience have demonstrated thefallacy of some, and greatly impaired, if they have notutterly destroyed, the force of all of these objections.The fears, which where at that period so studiouslycherished ; the alarms, which were so forcibly spread ;the dangers to liberty, which were so strangely exaggerated; and the predominance of aristocratical andexclusive power, which were so confidently predicted,have all vanished into air, into thin air.244 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.§ 338. It remains only to take notice of two qualificationsof the general principle of representation, whichare engrafted on the clause. One is, that each stateshall have at least one representative ; the other is thatalready quoted, that the number of representatives shallnot exceed one for every 30,000. The former wasindispensable in order to secure to each state a justrepresentation in each branch of the legislature ; which,as the powers of each branch were not exactly co-extensive,and especially, as the power of originating taxationwas exclusively vested in the house of representatives,was indispensable to preserve the equality ofthe small states, and to reconcile them to a surrenderof their sovereignty. This proviso was omitted in thefirst draft of the constitution, though proposed in oneof the preceding resolutions. But it was adopted withoutresistance, when the draft passed under the solemndiscussion of the convention. The other was a matterof more controversy. The original limitation proposedwas 40,000 ; and it was not until the very last day ofthe session of the convention, that the number was reducedto 30,000. The object of fixing some limitationwas to prevent the future existence of a very numerousand unwieldy house of representatives. Thefriends of a national government had no fears, that thebody would ever become too small for real, effectiveprotecting service. The danger was, that from thenatural impulses of the popular will, and the desire ofambitious candidates to attain office, the number wouldbe soon swollen to an unreasonable size, so that itwould at once generate, and combine factions, obstructdeliberations, and introduce and perpetuate turbulentand rash counsels.CH. IX.] HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 245^ 339. There yet remain two practical questions ofno inconsiderable importance, connected with the clauseof the constitution now under consideration. One is,what are to be deemed direct taxes within the meaningof the clause. The other is, in what manner the apportionmentof representatives is to be made. Thefirst will naturally come under review in examining thepowers of congress, and the constitutional limitationsupon those powers ; and may therefore, for the present,be passed over. The other was a subject of much discussionat the time, when the first apportionment wasbefore congress after the first census was taken ; andhas been recently revived with new and increased interestand ability. It deserves, therefore, a very deliberateexamination.^ 340. The language of the constitution is, that"representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned"among the several states, &:c. according to their"respective numbers;" and at the first view it wouldnot seem to involve the slightest difficulty. Amoment's reflection will dissipate the illusion, andteach us, that there is a difficulty intrinsic in the verynature of the subject. In regard to direct taxes, thenatural course would be to assume a particular sum tobe raised, as three millions of dollars ; and to apportionit among the states according to their relative numbers.But even here, there will always be a verysmall fractional amount incapable of exact distribution,since the numbers in each state will never exactly coincidewith any common divisor, or give an exact aliquotpart for each state without any remainder. But, as theamount may be carried through a long series of descendingmoney fractions, it may be ultimately reducedto the smallest fraction of any existing, or even imaginarycoin.246 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.^341. But the difficulty is far otherwise in regardto representatives. Here, there can be no subdivisionof the unit ; each state must be entitled to an entire representative,and a fraction of a representative is incapableof apportionment. Yet it will be perceived atonce, that it is scarcely possible, and certainly is whollyimprobable, that the relative numbers in each stateshould bear such an exact proportion to the aggregate,that there should exist a common divisor for all, whichshould leave no fraction in any state. Such a casenever yet has existed ; and in all human probability itnever will. Every common divisor, hitherto applied,has left a fraction greater, or smaller in every state ;and what has been in the past must continue to be forthe future. Assume the whole population to be three,or six, or nine, or twelve millions, or any other number; if you follow the injunctions of the constitution,and attempt to apportion the representatives accordingto the numbers in each state, it will be found to beabsolutely impossible. The theory, however true,becomes practically false in its application. Each statemay have assigned a relative proportion of representativesup to a given number, the whole being divisibleby some common divisor ; but the fraction of populationbelonging to each beyond that point is left unprovidedfor. So that the apportionment is, at best, onlyan approximation to the rule laid down by the constitution,and not a strict compliance with the rule. Thefraction in one state may be ten times as great, asthat in another ; and so may differ in each state in anyassignable mathematical proportion. What then is tobe done? Is the constitution to be wholly disregardedon this point ? Or is it to be followed out in its truespirit, though unavoidably differing from the letter, byCH. IX.] HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 247the nearest approximation to it ? If an additional representativecan be assigned to one state beyond itsrelative proportion to the whole population, it is equallytrue, that it can be assigned to all, that are in a similarpredicament. If a fraction admits of representation inany case, what prohibits the application of the rule toall fractions ? The only constitutional limitation seemsto be, that no state shall have more than one representativefor every thirty thousand persons. Subject tothis, the truest rule seems to be, that the apportionmentought to be the nearest practical approximationto the terms of the constitution ; and the rule ought tobe such, that it shall always work the same way in regardto all the states, and be as little open to cavil, orcontroversy, or abuse, as possible.w ^ 342. But it may be asked, what are the first stepsto be taken in order to arrive at a constitutional apportionment7 Plainly, by taking the aggregate of populationin all the states, (according to the constitutionalrule,) and then ascertain the relative proportion of thepopulation of each state to the population of the whole.This is necessarily so in regard to direct taxes ; andthere is no reason to say, that it can, or ought to beotherwise in regard to representatives ; for that wouldbe to contravene the very injunctions of the constitution,which require the like rule of apportionment ineach case. In the one, the apportionment may be rundown below unity ; in the other, it cannot. But thisdoes not change the nature of the rule, but only theextent of its application.^ 343. The next clause of the second section of thefirst article, is : " When vacancies happen in the representationof any state, the executive authority thereofshall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies." .248 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.§ 344. The propriety of adopting this clause doesnot seem to have furnished any matter of discussion,either in, or out of the convention. It was obvious,that the power ought to reside somewhere ; and mustbe exercised, either by the state or national government,or by some department thereof. The friends ofstate powers would naturally rest satisfied with leavingit with the state executive ; and the friends of the nationalgovernment would acquiesce in that arrangement, ifother constitutional provisions existed sufficient to preserveits due execution. The provision, as it stands,has the strong recommendation of public convenience,and facile adaptation to the particular local circumstancesof each state. Any general regulation wouldhave worked with some inequality.^ 345. The next clause is, that " the house of representativesshall choose their speaker, and otherofficers, and shall have the sole power of impeachment."§ 346. Each of these privileges is of great practicalvalue and importance. In Great Britain the house ofcommons elect their own speaker ; but he must be approvedby the king. This approval is now altogethera matter of course ; but anciently, it seems, the kingintimated his wish previously, in order to avoid thenecessity of a refusal ; and it was acceded to. Thevery language used by the speakers in former times, inorder to procure the approval of the crown, was suchas would not now be tolerated ; and indicated, at least,a disposition to undue subserviency. A similar powerof approval existed in the royal governors in manyof the colonies before the revolution. The exclusiveright of choosing a speaker, without any appeal to, orapproval by any other department of the government.CH. IX.] HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 249is an improvement upon the British system. It securesa more independent and unlimited choice on the partof the house, according to the merits of the individual,and their own sense of duty. It avoids those inconveniencesand collisions, which might arise from theinterposition of a negative in times of high party excitement.It extinguishes a constant source of jealousy andheart-burning ; and a disposition on one side to exertan undue influence, and on the other to assume a hostileopposition. It relieves the executive departmentfrom all the embarrassments of opposing the popularwill ; and the house from all the irritation of not consultingthe cabinet wishes.§ 347. The other power, the sole power of impeachment,has a far wider scope and operation. An impeachment,as described in the common law of England,is a presentment by the house of commons, the mostsolemn grand inquest of the whole kingdom, to thehouse of lords, the most high and supreme court ofcriminal jurisdiction of the kingdom. The articles ofimpeachment are a kind of bill of indictment found bythe commons, and tried by the lords, who are, in casesof misdemeanors, considered, not only as their ownpeers, but as the peers of the whole nation. Theorigin and history of the jurisdiction of parliament, incases of impeachment, are summarily given by Mr.Wooden ; but little can be gathered from it, which isnow of much interest, and, like most other legal antiquities,it is involved in great obscurity. To whatclasses of offenders it applies, will be more properlyan inquiry hereafter. In the constitution of the UnitedStates, the house of representatives exercises the functionsof the house of commons in regard to impeachments; and the senate (as we shall hereafter see) theAbr. 32250 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.functions of the house of lords in relation to the trial of*the party accused. The principles of the commonlaw, so far as the jurisdiction is to be exercised, aredeemed of primary obligation and government. Theobject of prosecutions of this sort in both countries isto reach high and potent offenders, such as might bepresumed to escape punishment in the ordinary tribunals,either from their own extraordinary influence, orfrom the imperfect organization and powers of thosetribunals. These prosecutions are, therefore, conductedby the representatives of the nation, in theirpublic capacity, in the face of the nation, and upon aresponsibility, which is at once felt, and reverenced bythe whole community. The notoriety of the proceedings; the solemn manner, in which they are conducted ;the deep extent, to which they affect the reputation ofthe accused ; the ignominy of a conviction, which is tobe known through all time ; and the glory of an acquittal,which ascertains and confirms innocence ; — these^ are all calculated to produce a vivid and lasting interestin the public mind ; and to give to such prosecutions,then necessary, a vast importance, both as a check tocrime, and an incitement to virtue.§ 348. This subject will be resumed hereafter, whenthe other provisions of the constitution, in regard toimpeachments, come under review. It does not appear,that the vesting of the power of impeachment inthe house of representatives was deemed a matter ofserious doubt or question, either in the convention, orwith the people. If the true spirit of the constitution isconsulted, it would seem difficult to arrive at any otherconclusion, than of its fitness. It is designed, as amethod of national inquest into the conduct of publicmen. If such is the design, who can so properly be therCH. IX.] HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 251inquisitors for the nation, as the representatives of thepeople themselves ? They must be presumed to bewatchful of the interests, alive to the sympathies, andready to redress the grievances, of the people. If it ismade their duty to bring official delinquents to justice,they can scarcely fail of performing it without publicdenunciation, and political desertion, on the part of theirconstituents.\252 CONSTITUTION OF THE CJ. STATES. [bOOK III.CHAPTER X.THE SENATE.^ 349. The third section of the first article relatesto the organization and powers of the senate.^ 350. In considering the organization of the senate,our inquiries naturally lead us to ascertain ; first, thenature of the representation and vote of the states therein;secondly, the mode of appointment; thirdly, thenumber of the senators ; fourthly, their term of service ;and fifthly, their qualifications.§ 351. The first clause of the third section is in thefollowing words: "The senate of the United Statesshall be composed of two senators from each state,chosen by the legislature thereof for six years ; andeach senator shall have one vote."§ 352. In the first place, the nature of the representationand vote in the senate. Each state is entitled totwo senators; and each senator is entitled to one vote.This, of course, involves in the very consdtution of thisbranch of the legislature a perfect equality among allthe states, without any reference to their respectivesize, population, wealth, or power. In this respectthere is a marked contrast between the senate and thehouse of representatives. In the latter, there is a representationof the people according to the relative populationof each state upon a given basis; in the former,each state in its political capacity is represented upona footing of perfect equality, like a congress of sovereigns,or ambassadors, or like an assembly of peers.The only difference between it and the continentalcongress under the old confederation is, that in thisCH. X.] THE SENATE. 253the vote was by states ; in the senate, each senator hasasingle vote. So that, though they represent states,they vote as individuals. The vote of the senate thusmay, and often does, become a mixed vote, embracinga part of the senators from some of the states on oneside, and another part on the other.^ 353. It is obvious, that this arrangement could onlyarise from a compromise between independent states ;and it must have been less the result of theory, than "ofa spirit of amity, and of mutual deference and concessions,which the peculiarity of the situation of the UnitedStates rendered indispensable." It constituted oneof the great struggles between the large and the smallstates, which was constantly renewed in the convention,and impeded it in every step of its progress in theformation of the constitution. The struggle applied tothe organization of each branch of the legislature. Thesmall states insisted upon an equality of vote and representationin each branch ; and the large states upona vote in proportion to their relative importance andpopulation. Upon this vital question there was so neara balance of the states, that a union in any form of government,which provided either for a perfect equality orinequality of the states in both branches of the legislature,became utterly hopeless. If the basis of thesenate was an equality of representation, the basis ofthe house must be in proportion to the relative populationof the states. A compromise was, therefore, indispensable,or the convention must be dissolved. Thesmall states at length yielded the point, as to an equalityof representation in the house, and acceded to a representationproportionate to the federal numbers. Butthey insisted upon an equality in the senate. To thisthe large states were unwilling to assent ; and for aCONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.time the states were, on this point, equally divided.Finally, the subject was referred to a committee, whoreported a scheme, which became, with some amendments,the basis of the representation, as it now stands.^ 354. Whatever may now be thought of the reasoningof the contending parties, no person, who possessesa sincere love of country, and wishes for the permanentunion of the states, can doubt, that the compromiseactually made was well founded in policy, andmay now be fully vindicated upon the highest principlesof political wisdom, and the true nature of the government,which was intended to be established.§ 355. No system could be more admirably contrivedto ensure due deliberation and inquiry, and justresults in all matters of legislation. No law or resolutioncan be passed without the concurrence, first of amajority of the people, and then of a majority of thestates. The interest, and passions, and prejudices ofa district are thus checked by the influence of a wholestate; the like interests, and passions, and prejudicesof a state, or of a majority of the states, are met andcontrolled by the voice of the people of the nation. Itmay be thought, that this complicated system of checksmay operate, in some instances, injuriously, as well asbeneficially. But if it should occasionally work unequally,or injuriously, its general operation will be salutaryand useful. The disease most incident to free governmentsis the facility and excess of law-making; andwhile it never can be the permanent interest of eitherbranch to interpose any undue restraint upon the exerciseof all fit legislation, a good law had better occasionallyfail, rather than bad laws be multiplied with aheedless and mischievous frequency. Even reforms,to be safe, must, in general, be slow ; and there can beCH. X.] THE SENATE. 255little danger, that public opinion will not sufficientlystimulate all public bodies to changes, which are at oncedesirable, and politic. All experience proves, that thehuman mind is more eager and restless for changes,than tranquil and satisfied with existing institutions.Besides; the large states will always be able, by theirpower over the supplies, to defeat any unreasonableexertions of this prerogative by the smaller states.^ 356. This reasoning, which theoretically seemsentided to great weight, has in the progress of thegovernment, been fully realized. It has not onlybeen demonstrated, that the senate, in its actual organization,is well adopted to the exigencies of thenation ; but that it is a most important and valuablepart of the system, and the real balance-wheel, whichadjusts, and regulates its movements. The otherauxiliary provisions in the same clause, as to the modeof appointment and duration of office, will be foundto conduce very largely to the same beneficial end.§ 357. Secondly ; the mode of appointment ofthe senators. They are to be chosen by the legislatureof each state.' Three schemes presented themselves,as to the mode of appointment ; one was by the legislatureof each state ; another was by the people thereof;and a third was by the other branch of the nationallegislature, either directly, or out of a select nomination.The last scheme was proposed in the convention, inwhat was called the Virginia scheme, one of the resolutions,declaring, " that the members of the secondbranch (the senate) ought to be elected by those ofthe first (the house of representatives) out of a propernumber nominated by the individual legislatures" (ofthe states.) It met, however, with no decided support,and was negatived, no state voting in its favour, nine256 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [book III.States voting against it, and one being divided. Thesecond scheme, of an election by the people in districts,or otherwise, seems to have met with as little favour.The first scheme, that of an election by the legislature,finally prevailed by a unanimous vote.§ 358. The constitution has not provided for themanner, in which the choice shall be made by thestate legislatures, whether by a joint, or by a concurrentvote ; the latter is, where both branches form oneassembly, and give a united vote numerically ; theformer is, where each branch gives a separate and independentvote. As each of the state legislatures nowconsists of two branches, this is a very important practicalquestion. Generally, but not universally, thechoice of senators is made by a concurrent vote.Another question might be suggested, whether the executiveconstitutes a part of the legislature for such apurpose, in cases where the state constitution giveshim a qualified negative upon the laws. But this hasbeen silence and universally settled against the executiveparticipation in the appointment.^ 359. Thirdly ; the number of senators. Eachstate is entitled to two senators. It is obvious, that toensure competent knowledge and ability to dischargeall the functions entrusted to the senate, (of whichmore will be said hereafter,) it is indispensable, that itshould consist of a number sufficiency large to ensurea sufficient variety of talents, experience, and practicalskill, for the discharge of all their duties. The legislativepower alone, for its enlightened and prudent exercise,requires (as has been already shown) no smallshare of patriotism, and knowledge, and ability. Inproportion to the extent and variety of the labours oflegislation, there should be members, who should shareCH. X.J THE SENATE. 257them, in order, that there may be a punctual and perfectperformance of them. If the number be verysmall, there is danger, that some of the proper dutieswill be overlooked, or neglected, or imperfectly attendedto. No human genius, or industry, is adequate toall the vast concerns of government, if it be not aidedby the power and skill of numbers. The senateought, therefore, on this account alone, to be somewhatnumerous, though it need not, and indeed oughtnot, for other reasons, to be as numerous, as the house.Besides ; numbers are important to give to the bodya sufficient firmness to resist the influence, which thepopular branch will ever be solicitous to exert overthem. A very small body is more easily overawed,and intimidated, and controlled by external influences,than one of a reasonable size, embracingweight of character, and dignity of talents. Numbersalone, in many cases, confer power ; and what is ofnot less importance, they present more resistance tocorruption and intrigue. A body of five may be bribed,or overborne, when a body of fifty would be an irresistiblebarrier to usurpation.^ 360. In addition to this consideration, it is desirable,that a state should not be wholly unrepresented inthe national councils by mere accident, or by the temporaryabsence of its representative. If there be butasingle representative, sickness or casualty may deprivethe state of its vote on the most important occasions.It was on this account, (as well as others)that the confederation entitled each state to send notless than tivo^ nor more than seven delegates. In criticalcases, too, it might be of great importance to havean opportunity of consulting with a colleague or colleagues,having a common interest and feeling for theMr. 33258 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.State. And if it be not always in the strictest sensetrue, that in the multitude of counsel there is safety ;there is a sufficient foundation in the infirmity of humannature to make it desirable to gain the advantageof the wisdom, and information, and reflection of otherindependent minds, not labouring under the suspicionof any unfavourable bias. These reasons may be presumedto have had their appropriate weight in thedeliberations of the convention. If more than onerepresentative of a state was to be admitted into thesenate, the least practicable ascending number wasthat adopted. At that time a single representative ofeach state would have made the body too small for allthe purposes of its institution, and all the objects beforeexplained. It would have been composed but ofthirteen ; and supposing no absences, which could notordinarily be calculated upon, seven would constitutea majority to decide all the measures. Twenty-sixwas not, at that period, too large a number for dignity,independence, wisdom, experience, and efficiency.And, at the present moment, when the states havegrown to twenty-four, it is found, that forty-eight is anumber quite small enough to perform the great nationalfunctions confided to it, and to embody the requisiteskill and ability to meet the increased exigencies,and multiplied duties of the office. There isprobably no legislative body on earth, whose dutiesare more various, and interesting, and important tothe public welfare ; and none, which calls for highertalents, and more comprehensive attainments, andmore untiring industry, and integrity.^ 361. Fourthly ; the term of service of the senators.It is for six years ; although, as will be presentlyseen, another element in the composition of that bodyis, that one third of it is changed every two years.CH. X.] THE SENATE. 259What would be the most proper period of office forsenators, was an inquiry, admitting of a still widerrange of argument and opinion, than what would bethemost proper for the members of the house of representatives.The subject was confessedly one fullof intricacy, and doubt, upon which the wisest statesmenmight well entertain very different views, andthe best patriots might well ask for more information,without, in the slightest degree, bringing into questiontheir integrity, their love of liberty, or their devotionto a republican government.^ 362. The objections to the senatorial term of officeall resolve themselves into a single argument, howevervaried in its forms, or illustrations. That argument is,that political power is liable to be abused ,* and thatthe great security for public liberty consists in bringinghome responsibility, and dependence in those, who areentrusted with office ; and these are best attained byshort periods of office, and frequent expressions of publicopinion in the choice of officers. If the argumentis admitted in its most ample scope, it still leaves thequestion open to much discussion, what is the properperiod of office, and how frequent the elections shouldbe. This question must, in its nature, be complicated ;and may admit, if it does not absolutely require, differentanswers, as applicable to different functionaries.Without wandering into ingenious speculations uponthe topic in its most general form, our object will beto present the reasons, which have been, or may berelied on, to establish the sound policy and wisdom ofthe duration of office of the senators as fixed by theconstitution.^ 363. In the first place, then, all the reasons, whichapply to the duration of the legislative office generally,260 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.founded upon the advantages of various knowledge,and experience in the principles and duties of legislation,may be urged with increased force in regard tothe senate. A good government implies two things ;first, fidelity to the object of government, which is thehappiness of the people ; secondly, a knowledge of themeans, by which that object is to be attained. Somegovernments are deficient in both these qualities ; mostare deficient in the first. Some of our wisest statesmenhave not scrupled to assert, that in the Americangovernments too little attention has been paid to thelatter.§ 364. A well constituted senate, then, which shouldinterpose some restraints upon the sudden impulses ofa more numerous branch, would, on this account, be ofgreat value. But its value would be incalculably increasedby making its term of office such, that withmoderate industry, talents, and devotion to the publicservice, its members could scarcely fail of having thereasonable information, which would guard them againstgross errors, and the reasonable firmness, which wouldenable them to resist visionary speculations, and popularexcitements. If public men know, that they maysafely wait for the gradual action of a sound publicopinion, to decide upon the merit of their actions andmeasures, before they can be struck down, they willbe more ready to assume responsibility, and pretermitpresent popularity for future solid reputation. If theyare designed, by the very structure of the government,to secure the states against encroachments upon theirrights and liberties, this very permanence of office addsnew means to effectuate the object. Popular opinion,may, perhaps, in its occasional extravagant sallies, atthe instance of a fawning demagogue, or a favoriteCH. X.] THE SENATE. 261chief, incline to overleap the constitutional barriers, inorder to aid their advancement, or gratify their ambition.But the solid judgment of a senate may stay theevil, if its oven duration of power exceeds that of theother branches of the government, or if it combines thejoint durability of both. In point of fact, the senatehas this desirable limit. It combines the period ofoffice of the executive with that of the members of thehouse ; while at the same time, from its own biennialchanges, (as we shall presently see,) it is silently subjectedto the deliberate voice of the states.^ 365, In the next place, mutability in the publiccouncils, arising from a rapid succession of new members,is found by experience to work, even in domesticconcerns, serious mischiefs. It is a known fact in thehistory of the states, that every new election changesnearly or quite one half of its representatives ; and inthe national government changes less frequent, or lessnumerous can scarcely be expected. From this changeof men, there must unavoidably arise a change of opinions; and with this change of opinions a correspondentchange of measures. Now experience demonstrates,that a continual change, even of good measures forgood, is inconsistent with every rule of prudence andevery prospect of success. In all human affairs, timeis required to consolidate the elements of the best concertedmeasures, and to adjust the little interferences,which are incident to all legislation. Perpetual changesin public institutions not only occasion intolerable controversies,and sacrifices of private interests ; but checkthe growth of that steady industry and enterprise, which,by wise forecast, lays up the means of future prosperity.^ 366. But the ill effects of a mutable governmentare still more strongly felt in the intercourse with CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.reign nations. It forfeits the respect and confidence offoreign nations, and all the advantages connected withnational character. It not only lays its measures opento the silent operations of foreign intrigue and management; but it subjects its whole policy to be counteractedby the wiser and more stable policy of itsforeign rivals and adversaries. One nation is to another,what one individual is to another, with this melancholydistinction perhaps, that the former, with fewerbenevolent emotions than the latter, are under fewerrestraints also from taking undue advantages of the indiscretionsof each other. If a nation is perpetuallyfluctuating in its measures, as to the protection of agriculture,commerce, and manufactures, it exposes all itsinfirmities of purpose to foreign nations ; and the latterwith a systematical sagacity will sap all the foundationsof its prosperity.§ 367. Further ; foreign governments can neversafely enter into any permanent arrangements withone, whose councils and government are perpetuallyfluctuating. It was not unreasonable, therefore, forthem to object to the continental congress, that theycould not guaranty the fulfilment of any treaty ; andtherefore it was useless to negotiate any. To securethe respect of foreign nations, there must be power tofulfil engagements ; confidence to sustain them ; anddurability to ensure their execution on the part of thegovernment. National character in cases of this sortisinestimable. It is not sufficient, that there shouldbe a sense of justice, and disposition to act right ; butthere must be an enlightened permanency in the policyof the government.^ 368. Considering, then, the various functions ofthe senate, the qualifications of skill, experience, andCH. X.] THE SENATE. 263information, which are required to discharge them, andthe importance of interposing, not a nominal, but a realcheck, in order to guard the states from usurpationsupon their authority, and the people from becoming thevictims of violent paroxysms in legislation ; the termof six years vrould seem to hit the just medium betweena duration of office, which would too much resist,and a like duration, which would too much invitethose changes of policy, foreign and domestic, whichthe best interests of the country may require to bedeliberately weighed, and gradually introduced. Ifthe state governments are found tranquil, and prosperous,and safe, with a senate of two, three, four, andfive years' duration, it would seem impossible for theUnion to be in danger from a term of service of sixyears.^ 369. But, in order to quiet the last lingeringscruples of jealousy, the succeeding clause of the constitutionhas interposed an intermediate change in theelements of the body, which would seem to make itabsolutely above exception, if reason, and not fear, isto prevail ; and if government is to be a reality, andnot a vision.§ 370. It declares, " Immediately after they (thesenators) shall be assembled, in consequence of thefirst election, they shall be divided, as equally as maybe,into three classes. The seats of the senators ofthe first class shall be vacated at the expiration ofthe second year ; of the second class, at the expirationof the fourth year ; and of the third class, at theexpiration of the sixth year, so that one third may bechosen every second year." A proposition was madein the convention, that the senators should be chosenfor nine years, one third to go out biennially, and was264 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.lost, three states voting in the affirmative, and eight inthe negative ; and then the present limitation wasadopted by a vote of seven states against four. Here,then, is a clause, which, without impairing the efficiencyof the senate for the discharge of its high functions,gradually changes its members, and introduces a biennialappeal to the states, which must for ever prohibitany permanent combination for sinister purposes. Noperson would probably propose a less duration of officefor the senate, than double the period of the house.In effect, this provision changes the composition oftwo thirds of that body within that period.^371. As vacancies might occur in the senate duringthe recess of the state legislature, it became indispensableto provide for that exigency. Accordinglythe same clause proceeds to declare : " And if vacancieshappen by resignation, or otherwise, during therecess of the legislature of any state, the executivethereof may make temporary appointments until thenext meeting of the legislature, which shall then fillsuch vacancies." It does not appear, that anystrong objection was urged in the convention againstthis proposition, although it was not adopted withoutsome opposition. There seem to have been threecourses presented for the consideration of the convention; either to leave the vacancies unfilled, until themeeting of the state legislature ; or to allow the statelegislatures to provide at their pleasure prospectivelyfor the occurrence ; or to confide a temporary appointmentto some select state functionary or body. Thelatter was deemed the most satisfactory and convenientcourse. Confidence might justly be reposed inthe state executive, as representing at once the interestsand wishes of the state, and enjoying all the proc.X.] THE SENATE. 265per means of knowledge and responsibility, to ensurea judicious appointment.^ 372. Fifthly ; the qualifications of senators. Theconstitution declares, that " No person shall be a senator,who shall not have attained the age of thirtyyears, and been nine years a citizen of the UnitedStates, and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitantof that state, for which he shall be chosen."As the nature of the duties of a senator require moreexperience, knowledge, and stability of character, thanthose of a representative, the qualification in point ofage is raised. A person may be a representative attwenty-five ; but he cannot be a senator until thirty.A similar qualification of age was required of the membersof the Roman senate. It would have been asomewhat singular anomaly in the history of free governments,to have found persons actually exercisingthe highest functions of government, who, in some enlightenedand polished countries, would not be deemedto have arrived at an age sufficiently mature to beentitled to all the private and municipal privileges ofmanhood. In Rome persons were not deemed at fullage until twenty-five ; and that continues to be therule in France, and Holland, and other civil law countries; and in France, by the old law, in regard tomarriage full age was not attained until thirty. Ithas since been varied, and the term diminished.^ 373. The age of senators was fixed in the constitutionat first by a vote of seven states against four ;and finally, by an unanimous vote. Perhaps no one,in our day, is disposed to question the propriety of thislimitation ; and it is, therefore, useless to discuss apoint, which is so purely speculative. If counsels areto be wise, the ardour, and impetuosity, and confider.34266 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.hence of youth must be chastised by the sober lessonsof experience ; and if knowledge, and solid judgment,and tried integrity, are to be deemed indispensablequalifications for senatorial service, it would be rashnessto affirm, that thirty years is too long a period foradue maturity and probation.^ 374. The next qualification is citizenship. Thepropriety of some limitation upon admissions to office,after naturalization, cannot well be doubted. Thesenate is to participate largely in transactions with foreigngovernments ; and it seems indispensable, thattime should have elapsed sufficient to wean a senatorfrom all prejudices, resentments, and partialities, inrelation to the land of his nativity, before he shouldbe entrusted with such high and delicate functions.Besides ; it can scarcely be presumed, that any foreignercan have acquired a thorough knowledge of theinstitutions and interests of a country, until he hasbeen permanently incorporated into its society, andhas acquired by the habits and intercourse of life thefeelings and the duties of a citizen. And if he hasacquired the requisite knowledge, he can scarcely feelthat devoted attachment to them, which constitutesthe great security for fidelity and promptitude in thedischarge of official duties. If eminent exceptionscould be stated, they would furnish no safe rule ; andshould rather teach us to fear our being misled bybrilliancy of talent, or disinterested patriotism, into aconfidence, which might betray, or an acquiescence,which might weaken, that jealousy of foreign influence,which is one of the main supports of republics. Inthe convention it was at first proposed, that the limitationshould be four years ; and it was finally alteredby a vote of six states against four, one being divided,CH. X.] THE SENATE. 267which was afterwards confirmed by a vote of eightstates to three. This subject has been already somewhatconsidered in another place ; and it may be concluded,by adopting the language of the Federalist onthe same clause. " The term of nine years appearsto be a prudent mediocrity between a total exclusionof adopted citizens, whose merit and talents may claima share in the public confidence, and an indiscriminateand hasty admission of them, which might create achannel for foreign influence in the national councils."^ 315. The only other qualification is, that every senatorshall, when elected, be an inhabitant of the state,for which he is chosen. This scarcely requires anycomment ; for it is manifestly proper, that a stateshould be represented by one, who, besides an intimateknowledge of all its wants and wishes, and localpursuits, should have a personal and immediate interestin all measures touching its sovereignty, its rights, orits influence. The only surprise is, that provision wasnot made for his ceasing to represent the state in thesenate, as soon as he should cease to be an inhabitant.There does not seem to have been any debate in theconvention on the propriety of inserting the clause, asit now stands.^ 376. In concluding this topic, it is proper to remark,that no qualification whatsoever of property isestablished in regard to senators, as none had beenestablished in regard to representatives. Merit, therefore,and talent have the freest access open to theminto every department of office under the national government.Under such circumstances, if the choice ofthe people is but directed by a suitable sobriety ofjudgment, the senate cannot fail of being distinguishedfor wisdom, for learning, for exalted patriotism, for incorruptibleintegrity, and for inflexible independence.268 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.§ 377. The next clause of the ihh'd section of thefirst article respects the person, who shall preside inthe senate. It declares, that " the Vice President ofthe United States shall be president of the senate ;** but shall have no vote, unless the be equally divided;" and the succeeding clause, that " the senateshall choose their other officers, and also a presidentpro tempore, in the absence of the vice president, orwhen he shall exercise the office of president of theUnited States."§ 378. The original article, as first reported, authorizedthe senate to choose its own president, and otherofficers ; and this was adopted in the convention. Butthe same draft authorized the president of the senate,in case of the removal, death, resignation, or disabilityof the president, to discharge his duties. When at alate period of the convention it was deemed advisable,that there should be a vice president, the propriety ofretaining him, as presiding officer of the senate, seemsto have met with general favour, eight states votingin the affirmative, and two only in the negative.^ 379. The propriety of creating the office of vicepresident will be reserved for future consideration,w^hen, in the progress of these commentaries, the constitutionof the executive department comes under review.The reasons, why he was authorized to presidein the senate, belong appropriately to this place.^ 380. There is no novelty in the appointment of aperson to preside, as speaker, who is not a constituentmember of the body, over which he is to preside. Inthe house of lords in England the presiding officer isthe lord chancellor, or lord keeper of the great seal,or other person appointed by the king's commission ;and if none such be so appointed, then it is said, thatCH. X.] THE SENATE. 269the lords may elect. But it is by no means necessary,that the person appointed by the king should be a peerof the realm, or lord of parliament. Nor has this appointmentby the king ever been complained of, as agrievance, nor has it operated with inconvenience oroppression in practice. It is on the contrary deemedan important advantage, both to the officer, and to thehouse of peers, adding dignity and weight to the former,and securing great legal ability and talent in aidof the latter. This consideration alone might havehad some influence in the convention. The vice presidentbeing himself chosen by the states, might wellbe deemed, in point of age, character, and dignity,worthy to preside over the deliberations of the senate,in which the states were all assembled, and represented.His impartiality in the discharge of its duties mightbe fairly presumed ; and the employment would notonly bring his character in review before the public ;but enable him to justify the public confidence, byperforming his public functions with independence,and firmness, and sound discretion. A citizen, whowas deemed worthy of being one of the competitorsfor the presidency, could scarcely fail of being distinguishedby private virtues, by comprehensive acquirements,and by eminent services. Jn all questions beforethe senate he might safely be appealed to, as a fitarbiter upon an equal division, in which pase alone heis entrusted with a vote.^381. But the strong motive for this appointmentwas of another sort, founded upon state jealousy, andstate equality in the senate. If the speaker of thesenate was to be chosen from its own members, thestate, upon whom the choice would fall, might possesseither more or less, than its due share of influence. If270 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.the speaker were not allowed to vote, except whenthere was an equal division, independent of his ownvote, then the state might lose its own voice ; if hewere allowed to give his vote, and also a casting vote,then the state might, in effect, possess a double vote.Either alternative would of itself present a predicamentsufficiently embarrassing. On the other hand, if nocasting vote were allowed in any case, then the indecisionand inconvenience might be very prejudicial tothe public interests, in case of an equality of votes.It might give rise to dangerous feuds, or intrigues,and create sectional and state agitations. The smallerstates might well suppose, that their interests wereless secure, and less guarded, than they ought to be.Under such circumstances, the vice president wouldseem to be the most fit arbiter to decide, because hewould be the representative, not of one state only, butof all ; and must be presumed to feel a lively interestin promoting all measures for the public good. Thisreasoning appears to have been decisive in the convention,and satisfactory to the people. It establishes,that there was a manifest propriety in making the arrangement,( conducive to the harmony of the states,and the dignity of the general government. And asthe senate possesses the power to make rules for itsown proceedings, there is little danger, that there canever arise auy abuse of the presiding power. Thedanger, if any, is rather the other way, that the presidingpower will be either silently weakened, oropenly surrendered, so as to leave the office littlemore, than the barren honour of a place, without influenceand without action.^ 382. The propriety of entrusting the senate withthe choice of its other officers, and also of a presidentCH. X.] THE SENATE. 271pro tempore in the absence of the vice president, orwhen he exercises the office of president, seems neverto have-been questioned ; and indeed is so obvious,that it is wholly unnecessary to vindicate it. Confidencebetween the senate and its officers, and thepower to make a suitable choice, and to secure asuitable responsibility for the faithful discharge of theduties of office, are so indispensable for the public good,that the provision will command universal assent, assoon as it is mentioned. It has grown into a generalpractice for the vice president to vacate the senatorialchair a short time before the termination of each session,in order to enable the senate to choose a presidentpro tempore, who might already be in office, ifthe vice president in the recess should be called tothe chair of state. The practice is founded in wisdomand sound policy, as it immediately provides for anexigency, which may well be expected to occur at anytime; and prevents the choice from being influencedby temporary excitements or intrigues, arising fromthe actual existence of a vacancy. As it is useful inpeace to provide for war ; so it is likewise useful intimesof profound tranquillity to provide for politicalagitations, which may disturb the public harmony.§ 383. The next clause of the third section of thefirst article respects the subject of impeachment. Itis as follows : " The senate shall have the sole power'' to try all impeachments. When sitting for thatpurpose, they shall be on oath or affirmation. Whenthe president of the United States is tried, the chief"justice shall preside. And no person shall be convictedwithout the concurrence of two thirds of themembers present."^ 384. The great objects, to be attained in the CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [boOK III.lection of a tribunal for the trial of impeachments, are,impartiality, integrity, intelligence, and independence.If either of these is wanting, the trial must be radicallyimperfect. To ensure impartiality, the body must bein some degree removed from popular power and passions,from the influence of sectional prejudice, andfrom the more dangerous influence of mere party spirit.To secure integrity, there must be a lofty sense ofduty, and a deep responsibility to future times, as wellas to God. To secure intelligence, there must beage, experience, and high intellectual powers, as wellas attainments. To secure independence, there mustbe numbers, as well as talents, and a confidence resultingat once from permanency of place, and dignityof station, and enlightened patriotism. Does thesenate combine, in a suitable degree, all these qualifications? Does it combine them more perfectly, thanany other tribunal, which could be constituted ? Whatother tribunal could be entrusted with the authority ?These are questions of the highest importance, and ofthe most frequent occurrence. They arose in theconvention, and underwent a full discussion there.They were again deliberately debated in the stateconventions ; and they have been at various timessince agitated by jurists and statesmen, and politicalbodies. Few parts of the constitution have been assailedwith more vigour ; and few have been defendedwith more ability.^ 385. The subject is itself full of intrinsic difficultyin a government purely elective. The jurisdiction isto be exercised over offences, which are committed bypublic men in violation of their public trust and duties.Those duties are, in many cases, political ; and, indeed,in other cases, to which the power of impeachment willCH. X.] THE SENATE. 273probably be applied, they will respect functionaries ofa high character, where the remedy would otherwisebe wholly inadequate, and the grievance be incapableof redress. Strictly speaking, then, the power partakesof a political character, as it respects injuries to thesociety in its political character ; and, on this account,it requires to be guarded in its exercise against thespirit of faction, the intolerance of party, and the suddenmovements of popular feeling. The prosecutionwill seldom fail to agitate the passions of the wholecommunity, and to divide it into parties, more or lessfriendly, or hostile to the accused. The press, withits unsparing vigilance, will arrange itself on eitherside, to control, and influence public opinion ; andthere will always be some danger, that the decisionwill be regulated more by the comparative strength ofparties, than by the real proofs of innocence or guilt.§ 386. On the other hand, the delicacy and magnitudeof a trust, which so deeply concerns the politicalexistence and reputation of every man engaged in theadministration of public affairs, cannot be overlooked.It ought not to be a power so operative and instant,that it may intimidate a modest and conscientiousstatesman, or other functionary from accepting office ;nor so weak and torpid, as to be capable of lulling offendersinto a general security and indifference. Thedifficulty of placing it rightly in a government, restingentirely on the basis of periodical elections, will bemore strikingly perceived, when it is considered, thatthe ambitious and the cunning will often make strongaccusations against public men the means of their ownelevation to office ; and thus give an impulse to thepower of impeachment, by pre-occupying the publicopinion. The convention appears to have been veryAbr. 35274 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III. JStrongly impressed with the difficulty of constituting asuitable tribunal ; and finally came to the result, thatthe senate was the most fit depositary of this exaltedtrust. In so doing, they had the example before themof several of the best considered state constitutions ;and the example, in some measure, of Great Britain, jThe most strenuous opponent cannot, therefore, allege, 'that it is a rash and novel experiment ; the mostunequivocal friend must, at the same time, admit, thatit is not free from all plausible objections.§ 387. The conclusion, to which, upon a large surveyof the whole subject, our judgments are naturallyled, is, that the power has been wisely deposited withthe senate. In the language of a learned commentator,it may be said, that of all the departments of the government," none will be found more suitable to exercisethis peculiar jurisdiction, than the senate. Although,like their accusers, they are representatives of the people; yet they are so by a degree more removed, and holdtheir stations for a longer term. They are, therefore,more independent of the people, and being chosen withthe knowledge, that they may, while in office, be calledupon to exercise this high function, they bring withthem the confidence of their constituents, that theywill faithfully execute it, and the implied compact ontheir own part, that it shall be honestly discharged.Precluded from ever becoming accusers themselves, itis their duty not to lend themselves to the animositiesof party, or the prejudices against individuals, whichmay sometimes unconsciously induce the house of representativesto the acts of accusation. Habituated tocomprehensive views of the great political relations ofthe country, they are naturally the best qualified to decideon those charges, which may have any connexionCH.X.] THE SENATE. 275with transactions abroad, or great political interests athome. And although we cannot say, that, like theEnglish house of lords, they form a distinct body,wholly uninfluenced by the passions, and remote fromthe interests, of the people ; yet we can discover inno other division of the government a greater probabilityof impartiality and independence."^ 388. The remaining parts of the clause of theconstitution now under consideration will not requirean elaborate commentary. The first is, that the senate,when sitting as a court of impeachment, " shall be onoath or affirmation ;" a provision, which, as it appealsto the conscience and integrity of the members by thesame sanction, which applies to judges and jurors, whosit in other trials, will commend itself to all persons,who deem the highest trusts, rights, and duties, worthyof the same protection and security, at least, as thoseof the humblest order. It would, indeed, be a monstrousanomaly, that the highest officers might be convictedof the worst crimes, without any sanction beinginterposed against the exercise of the most vindictivepassions ; while the humblest individual has a rightto demand an oath of fidelity from those, who are hispeers, and his priors. In England, however, upon thetrial of impeachments, the house of lords are not underoath ; but only make a declaration upon their honour.This is a strange anomaly, as in all civil and criminaltrials by a jury, the jurors are under oath ; and thereseems no reason, why a sanction equally obligatoryupon the consciences of the priors should not exist intrials for capital or other offences before every othertribunal. What is there in the honour of a peer,which necessarily raises it above the honour of a commoner? The anomaly is rendered still more glaring276 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.by the fact, that a peer cannot give testimony, as awitness, except on oath ; for, here, his honour is nottrusted. The maxim of the law, in such a case, is injudicio non creditor, nisi juries. Why should theobligation of a judge be less solemn, than the obligationof a witness ? The truth is, that it is a privilegeof power, conceded in barbarous times, and foundedon feudal sovereignty, more than on justice, or principle.^ 389. The next provision is : "When the presidentof the United States is tried, the chief justice shallpreside." The reason of this clause has been alreadyadverted to. It is to preclude the vice president,who might be supposed to have a natural desire tosucceed to the office, from being instrumental in procuringthe conviction of the chief magistrate. Undersuch circumstances, who could be deemed more suitableto preside, than the highest judicial magistrate ofthe Union. His impartiality and independence couldbe as little suspected, as those of any person in thecountry. And the dignity of his station might wellbe deemed an adequate pledge for the possession ofthe highest accomplishments.^ 390. It is added, " And no person shall be convictedwithout the concurrence of two thirds of themembers present." Although very numerous objectionswere taken to the constitution, none seems tohave presented itself against this particular quorumrequired for a conviction ; and yet it might have beenfairly thought to be open to attack on various sidesfrom its supposed theoretical inconvenience and incongruity.It might have been said with some plausibility,that it deserted the general principles even ofcourts of justice, where a mere majority make the deck.X.] THE SENATE. 277vision ; and, of all legislative bodies, where a similarrule is adopted ; and, that the requisition of two thirdswould reduce the power of impeachment to a merenullity. Besides ; upon the trial of impeachments inthe house of lords the conviction or acquittal is by amere majority ; so that there is a failure of atiy analogyto support the precedent.^ 391. It does not appear from any authentic memorials,what were the precise grounds, upon whichthis limitation was interposed. But it may well beconjectured, that the real grounds were, to secure animpartial trial, and to guard public men from beingsacrificed to the immediate impulses of popular resentmentor party predominance. In England, the houseof lords, from its very structure and hereditary independence,furnishes a sufficient barrier against suchoppression and injustice. Mr. Justice Blackstone hasremarked, with manifest satisfaction, that the nobility*' have neither the same interests, nor the same passions,as popular assemblies ;" and, that " it is proper,that the nobility should judge, to insure justice to theaccused ; as it is proper, that the people should accuse,to insure justice to the commonwealth." Our senateis, from the very theory of the constitution, foundedupon a more popular basis ; and it was desirable toprevent any combination of a mere majority of thestates to displace, or to destroy a meritorious publicofficer. If a mere majority were sufficient to convict,there would be danger, in times of high popular commotionor party spirit, that the influence of the houseof representatives would be found irresistible. Theonly practicable check seemed to be, the introductionof the clause of two thirds, which would thus requirea union of opinion and interest, rare, except in cases,278 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.where guilt was manifest, and innocence scarcely presumable.Nor could the limitation be justly complainedof; for, in common cases, the law not onlypresumes every man innocent, until he is provedguilty ; but unanimity in the verdict of the jury is indispensable.Here, an intermediate scale is adoptedbetween unanimity, and a mere majority. And if theguilt of a public officer cannot be established to thesatisfaction of two thirds of a body of high talents andacquirements, which sympathizes with the people, andrepresents the states, after a full investigation of thefacts, it must be, that the evidence is too infirm, andtoo loose to justify a conviction. Under such circumstances,it would be far more consonant to the notionsof justice in a republic, that a guilty person shouldescape, than that an innocent person should becomethe victim of injustice from popular odium, or partycombinations.^ 392. The next clause is, that " Judgment in casesof impeachment shall not extend further, than to removalfrom office, and disqualification to hold andenjoy any office of honour, trust, or profit, under theUnited States. But the party convicted shall neverthelessbe liable and subject to indictment, trial,"judgment, and punishment, according to law."^ 393. It is obvious, that, upon trials on impeachments,one of two courses must be adopted in case ofa conviction ; either for the court to proceed to pronouncea full and complete sentence of punishmentfor the offence according to the law of the land in likecases, pending in the common tribunals of justice, superaddingthe removal from office, and the consequentdisabilities ; or, to confine its sentence to the removalfrom office and other disabilities. If the former dutyCH. X.] THE SENATE. 279be a part of the constitutional functions of the court,then, in case of an acquittal, there cannot be anothertrial of the party for the same offence in the commontribunals of justice, because it is repugnant to the wholetheory of the common law, that a man should bebrought into jeopardy of life or limb more than oncefor the same offence. A plea of acquittal is, therefore,an absolute bar against any second prosecution for thesame offence. If the court of impeachments is merelyto pronounce a sentence of removal from office andthe other disabilities ; then it is indispensable, thatprovision should be made, that the common tribunals ofjustice should be at liberty to entertain jurisdiction ofthe offence, for the purpose of inflicting the commonpunishment applicable to unofficial offenders. Otherwise,it might be matter of extreme doubt, whether,consistently with the great maxim above mentioned,established for the security of the life and limbs andliberty of the citizen, a second trial for the same offencecould be had, either after an acquittal, or a convictionin the court of impeachments. And if no suchsecond trial could be had, then the grossest officialoffenders might escape without any substantial punishment,even for crimes, which would subject their fellowcitizens to capital punishment.^ 394. The constitution, then, having provided, thatjudgment upon impeachments shall not extend further,than to removal from office, and disqualification to holdoffice, (which, however afflictive to an ambitious andelevated mind, would be scarcely felt, as a punishment,by the profligate and the base,) has wisely subjectedthe party to trial in the common criminal tribunals,for the purpose of receiving such punishment, as ordinarilybelongs to the offence. Thus, for instance.280 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.treason, which by our laws is a capital offence, mayreceive its appropriate punishment ; and bribery in highofficers, which otherwise would be a mere disqualificationfrom office, may have the measure of its infamydealt out to it with the same unsparing severity, whichattends upon other and humbler offenders.^ 395. In England, the judgment upon impeachmentsis not confined to mere removal from office ; butextends to the whole punishment attached by law tothe offence. The house of lords, therefore, upon aconviction, may, by its sentence, inflict capital punishment; or perpetual banishment ; or forfeiture of goodsand lands ; or fine and ransom ; or imprisonment ; aswell as removal from office, and incapacity to holdoffice, according to the nature and aggravation of theoffence.^ 396. As the offences, to which the remedy of impeachmenthas been, and will continue to be principallyapplied, are of a political nature, it is natural to suppose,that they will be often exaggerated by partyspirit, and the prosecutions be sometimes dictated byparty resentments, as well as by a sense of the publicgood. There is danger, therefore, that in casesof conviction the punishment may be wholly out ofproportion to the offence, and pressed as much bypopular odium, as by aggravated crime. From thenature of such offences, it is impossible to fix any exactgrade, or measure, either in the offences, or the punishments; and a very large discretion must unavoidablybe vested in the court of impeachments, as to both.Any attempt to define the offences, or to affix to everygrade of distinction its appropriate measure of punishment,would probably tend to more injustice and inconvenience,than it would correct ; and perhaps wouldCH. Xr.] The SENATE. 281render the power at once inefficient and unwieldy.The discretion, then, if confided at all, being peculiarlysubject to abuse, and connecting itself with state parties;and state contentions, and state animosities, it wasdeemed most advisable by the convention, that thepower of the senate to inflict punishment should merelyreach the right and qualifications to office ; and thustake away the temptation in factious times to sacrificegood and great men upon the altar of party. Historyhad sufficiently admonished them, that the power ofimpeachment had been thus mischievously and inordinatelyapplied in other ages ; and it was not safe todisregard those lessons, which it had left for our instruction,written not unfrequently in blood. LordStrafford, in the reign of Charles the First, and LordStafford, in the reign of Charles the Second, were bothconvicted, and punished capitally by the house of Lords ;and both have been supposed to have been rather victimsto the spirit of the times, than offenders meritingsuch high punishments. And other cases have occurred,in which, whatever may have been the demerits ofthe accused, his final overthrow has been the result ofpolitical resentments and hatreds, far more than of anydesire to promote public justice.^ 397. There is wisdom, and sound policy, and intrinsicjustice in this separation of the offence, at leastso far as the jurisdiction and trial are concerned, intoits proper elements, bringing the political part underthe power of the political department of the government,and retaining the civil part for presentment andtrial in the ordinary forum. A jury might well beentrusted with the latter; while the former should meetits appropriate trial and punishment before the senate.If it should be asked, why separate trials should thusAbr. 36282 cojfSTiTUTioir or the u. states, [book hi.be successively had ; and why, if a conviction shouldtake place in a court of law, that court might not be entrustedwith the power to pronounce a removal fromoffice, and the disqualification to office, as a part of itssentence, the answer has been already given in thereasoning against vesting any court of law with merelypolitical functions. In the ordinary course of the administrationof criminal justice, no court is authorizedto remove, or disqualify an offender, as a part of itsregular judgment. If it results at all, it results as aconsequence, and not as a part of the sentence. Butit may be properly urged, that the vesting of such «ahigh and delicate power, to be exercised by a court oflaw at its discretion, would, in relation to the distinguishedfunctionaries of the government, be peculiarlyunfit and inexpedient. What could be more embarrassing,than for a court of law to pronounce for a removalupon the mere ground of political usurpation, ormalversation in office, admitting of endless varieties,from the slightest guilt up to the most flagrant corruption7 Ought a president to be removed from office atthe mere will of a court for political misdemeanours 7Is not a political body, like the senate, from its superiorinformation in regard to executive functions, far betterqualified to judge, how far the public weal might bepromoted by such a punishment in a given case, than amere juridical tribunal? Suppose the senate shouldstill deem the judgment irregular, or unjustifiable, howis the removal to take effect, and how is it to be enforced? A separation of the removing power altogetherfrom the appointing power might create manypractical difficulties, which ought not, except upon themost urgent reasons, to be introduced into matters ofgovernment. Without attempting to maintain, that theCH. XI.] THE SENATE. 283difficulties would be insuperable, it is sufficient to show,that they might be highly inconvenient in practice.§ 398. In order to complete our review of the constitutionalprovisions on the subject of impeachments,it is necessary to ascertain, who are the persons liableto be impeached ; and what are impeachable offences.By some strange inadvertence, this part of the constitutionhas been taken from its natural connexion, andwith no great propriety arranged under that head, whichembraces the organization, and rights, and duties of theexecutive department. To prevent the necessity ofagain recurring to this subject, the general method prescribedin these commentaries will, in this instance, bedeparted from, and the only remaining provision onimpeachments be here introduced.§ 399. The fourth section of the second article is asfollows : " The president, vice-president, and all civilofficers of the United States, shall be removed fromoffice on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason,'bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanours."§ 400. From this clause it appears, that the remedyby impeachment is strictly confined to civil officers ofthe United States, including the president and vice-president.In this respect, it differs materially from thelaw and practice of Great-britain. In that kingdom,all the king's subjects, whether peers or commoners,are impeachable in parliament ; though it is asserted,that commoners cannot now be impeached for capitaloffences, but for misdemeanors only. Such kinds ofmisdeeds, however, as peculiarly injure the commonwealthby the abuse of high offices of trust, are the mostproper, and have been the most usual ground for thiskind of prosecution in parliament. There seems a peculiarpropriety, in a republican government at least, in284 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.confining the impeaching power to persons holdingoffice. In such a government all the citizens are equal,and ought to have the same security of a trial by jury,for all crimes and offences laid to their charge, when notholding any official character. To subject them to impeachmentwould not only be extremely oppressive andexpensive, but would endanger their lives and liberties,by exposing them against their wills to persecution fortheir conduct in exercising their political rights and privileges.Dear as the trial by jury justly is in civil cases,its value, as a protection against the resentment andviolence of rulers and factions, in criminal prosecutionsmakes it inestimable. It is there, and there only, thata citizen, in the sympathy, the impartiality, the intelligence,and incorruptible integrity of his fellows, channelledto try the accusation, may indulge a well-foundedconfidence to sustain and cheer him. If he should chooseto accept office, he would voluntarily incur all the additionalresponsibility growing out of it. If impeachedfor his conduct, while in office, he could not justly complain,since he was placed in that predicament by hisown choice ; and in accepting office he submitted to allthe consequences. Indeed, the moment it was decided,that the judgment upon impeachments should belimited to removal and disqualification from office, itfollowed as a natural result, that it ought not to reachany but officers of the United States. It seemsto have been the original object of the friends of thenational government to confine it to these limits ; for inthe original resolutions proposed to the convention, andin all the subsequent proceedings, the power was expresslylimited to national officers.§ 401. Who are "civil officers," within the meaningsthis constitutional provision, is an inquiry, which natusXI.] THE Senate. 285rally presents itself; and the answer cannot, perhaps,be deemed settled by any solemn adjudication. Theterm "civil" has various significations. It is sometimesused in contradistinction to barbarous, or savage,to indicate a state of society reduced to order and regulargovernment. Thus, we speak of civil life, civilsociety, civil government, and civil liberty ; in which itis nearly equivalent in meaning to political. It is sometimesused in contradistinction to criminal, to indicatethe private rights and remedies of men, as members ofthe community, in contrast to those, which are public,and relate to the government. Thus, we speak ofcivil process and criminal process, civil jurisdiction andcriminal jurisdiction. It is sometimes used in contradistinctionto military or ecclesiastical, to natural orforeign. Thus, we speak of a civil station, as opposedto a military or ecclesiastical station ; a civil death, asopposed to a natural death ; a civil war, as opposed to aforeign war. The sense, in which the term is used inthe constitution, seems to be in contradistinction to military,to indicate the rights and duties relating to citizensgenerally, in contradistinction to those of personsengaged in the land or naval service of the government.It is in this sense, that Blackstone speaks ofthe laity in England, as divided into three distinctstates ; the civil, the military, and the maritime ; thetwo latter embracing the land and naval forces of thegovernment. And in the same sense the expenses ofthe civil list of officers are spoken of, in contradistinctionto those of the army and navy.^ 402. All officers of the United States, therefore,who hold their appointments under the national government,whether their duties are executive or judicial, inthe highest or in the lowest departments of the CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.ernest, with the exception of officers in the armyand navy, are properly civil officers within the meaningof the constitution, and liable to impeachment. Thereason for excepting military and naval officers is, thatthey are subject to trial and punishment according toa peculiar military code, the laws, rules, and usages ofwar. The very nature and efficiency of military dutiesand discipline require this summary and exclusive jurisdiction; and the promptitude of its operations arenot only better suited to the notions of military men ;but they deem their honor and their reputation moresafe in the hands of their brother officers, than in anymerely civil tribunals. Indeed, in military and navalaffairs it is quite clear, that the senate could scarcelypossess competent knowledge or experience to decideupon the acts of military men ; so much are these actsto be governed by mere usage, and custom, by militarydiscipline, and military discretion, that the constitutionhas wisely committed the whole trust to the decisionof courts-martial.^ 403. The next inquiry is, what are impeachableoffences 1 They are " treason, bribery, or other highcrimes and misdemeanours." For the definition oftreason, resort may be had to the constitution itself; butfor the definition of bribery, resort is naturally and necessarilyhad to the common law ; for that, as the commonbasis of our jurisprudence, can alone furnish theproper exposition of the nature and Emits of this offence.The only practical question is, what are to be deemedhigh crimes and misdemeanours ? Now, neither theconstitution, nor any statute of the United States, has inany manner defined any crimes, except treason andbribery, to be high crimes and misdemeanours, and assuch impeachable. In what manner, then, are they toCH. XI.] THE SENATE. 287be ascertained ? Is the silence of the statute book tobe deemed conclusive in favour of the party, until congresshave made a legislative declaration and enumerationof the offences, which shall be deemed high crimesand misdemeanors 1 If so, then, as has been truly remarked,the power of impeachment, except as to thetwo expressed cases, is a complete nullity ; and theparty is wholly dis punishable, however enormous maybehis corruption or criminality. It will not be sufficientto say, that in the cases, where any offence is punishedby any statute of the United States, it may, and oughtto be, deemed an impeachable offence. It is not everyoffence, that by the constitution is so impeachable. Itmust not only be an offence, but a high crime and misdemeanour.Besides; there are many most flagrantoffences, which, by the statutes of the United States,are punishable only, when committed in special places,and within peculiar jurisdictions, as, for instance, on thehigh seas, or in forts, navy-yards, and arsenals, ceded tothe United States. Suppose the offence is committedin some other, than these privileged places, or undercircumstances not reached by any statute of the UnitedStates, would it be impeachable ?§ 404. Again, there are many offences, purely political,which have been held to be within the reach ofparliamentary impeachments, not one of which is in theslightest manner alluded to in our statute book. And,,indeed, political offences are of so various and complexa character, so utterly incapable of being defined,,or classified, that the task of positive legislation wouldbe impracticable, if it were not almost absurd to attemptit. What, for instance, could positive legislation do incases of impeachment, like the charges against WarrenHastings, in 1788? Resort, then, must be had eitherCONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.to parliamentary practice, and the common law, inorder to ascertain, what are high crimes and misdemeanours; or the whole subject must be left to the arbitrarydiscretion of the senate, for the time being. The latteris so incompatible with the genius of our institutions,that no lawyer or statesman would be inclined to countenanceso absolute a despotism of opinion and practice,which might make that a crime at one time, or in oneperson, which would be deemed innocent at anothertime, or in another person. The only safe guide insuch cases must be the common law, which is theguardian at once of private rights and public liberties.§ 405. Congress have unhesitatingly adopted theconclusion, that no previous statute is necessary toauthorize an impeachment for any official misconduct ;and the rules of proceeding, and the rules of evidence,as well as the principles of decision, have been uniformlyregulated by the known doctrines of the commonlaw and parliamentary usage. In the few cases ofimpeachment, which have hitherto been tried, no oneof the charges has rested upon any statutable misdemeanour.It seems, then, to be the settled doctrine ofthe high court of impeachment, that though the commonlaw cannot be a foundation of a jurisdiction notgiven by the constitution, or laws, that jurisdiction,when given, attaches, and is to be exercised accordingto the rules of the common law ; and that, what are, andwhat are not high crimes and misdemeanours, is to beascertained by a recurrence to that great basis ofAmerican jurisprudence.^ 406. As it is declared in one clause of theconstitution, that "judgment, in cases of impeachment,shall not extend further, than a removalfrom office, and disqualification to hold any office ofCH. X.] THE SENATE. 289"honour, trust, or profit, under the United States'*and in another clause, that " the president, vice-president,and all civil officers of the United States, shallbe removed from office on impeachment for, and convictionof, treason, bribery, or other high crimes ormisdemeanours ; " it would seem to follow, that thesenate, on the conviction, were bound, in all cases, toenter a judgment of removal from office, though it hasadiscretion, as to inflicting the punishment of disqualification.If, then, there must be a judgment of removalfrom office, it would seem to follow, that theconstitution contemplated, that the party was still inoffice at the time of the impeachment. If he was not,his offence was still liable to be tried and punished inthe ordinary tribunals of justice. And it might beargued with some force, that it would be a vain exerciseof authority to try a delinquent for an impeachableoffence, when the most important object, for which theremedy was given, was no longer necessary, or attainable.And although a judgment of disqualification mightstill be pronounced, the language of the constitutionmay create some doubt, whether it can be pronouncedwithout being coupled with a removal from office.There is also much force in the remark, that an impeachmentis a proceeding purely of a political nature. It isnot so much designed to punish an offender, as to securethe state against gross official misdemeanors. It touchesneither his person, nor his property ; but simplydivests him of his political capacity.^ 407. Having thus gone through the subject ofimpeachments, it only remains to observe, that a closesurvey of the system, unless we are egregiously deceived,will completely demonstrate the wisdom of thearrangements made in every part of it. The juridical.37290 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.tion to impeach is placed, where it should be, in thepossession and power of the immediate representativesof the people. The trial is before a body of great dignity,and ability, and independence, possessing therequisite knowledge and firmness to act with vigour,and to decide with impartiality upon the charges. Thepersons subjected to the trial are officers of the nationalgovernment; and the offences are such, as mayaffect the rights, duties, and relations of the party accusedto the public in his political or official character,either directly or remotely. The general rules of lawand evidence, applicable to common trials, are interposed,to protect the party against the exercise of wantonoppression, and arbitrary power. And the final judgmentis confined to a removal from, and disqualificationfor, office ; thus Uniting the punishment to such modesof redress, as are peculiarly fit for a political tribunal toadminister, and as will secure the public against politicalinjuries. In other respects the offence is left to bedisposed of by the common tribunals of justice, accordingto the laws of the land, upon an indictment foundby a grand jury, and a trial by jury of peers, beforewhom the party is to stand for his final deliverance, Ukehis fellow citizens.CH. XI.] ELECTIONS. 291CHAPTER XLELECTIONS AND MEETINGS OF CONGRESS.§ 408. The first clause of the fourth section of thefirst article is as follows : " The times, places, and mannerof holding elections for senators and representativesshall be prescribed in each state by the legislaturethereof. But the congress may, at any time, bylaw,make or alter such regulations, except as to theplace of choosing senators."^ 409. This clause does not appear to have attractedmuch attention, or to have encountered much oppositionin the convention, at least as far, as can be gatheredfrom the journal of that body. But it was afterwardsassailed by the opponents of the constitution, both inand out of the state conventions, with uncommon zealandvirulence. The objection was not to that part ofthe clause, which vests in the state legislatures the powerof prescribing the times, places, and manner fieldingelections ; for, so far, it was a surrender of power tothe state governments. But it was, to the superintendingpower of congress to make, or alter such regulations.It was said, that such a superintending power would bedangerous to the liberties of the people, and to a justexercise of their privileges in elections. Congressmight prescribe the times of election so unreasonably,as to prevent the attendance of the electors ; or theplace at so inconvenient a distance from the body ofthe electors, as to prevent a due exercise of the rightof choice. And congress might contrive the manner ofholding elections, so as to exclude all but their ownfavourites from office. They might modify the right of292 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.elections, as they should please; they might regulate thenumber of votes by the quantity of property, withoutinvolving any repugnancy to the constitution. These,and other suggestions of a similar nature, calculated tospread terror and alarm among the people, were dweltupon with peculiar emphasis.§ 410. In answer to all such reasoning, it was urged,that there was not a single article in the whole systemmore completely defensible. Its propriety rested uponthis plain proposition, that every government ought tocontain in itself the means of its own preservation. If,in the constitution, there were some departures fromthis principle, (as it might be admitted there were,) theywere matters of regret, and dictated by a controllingmoral or political necessity ; and they ought not to beextended. It was obviously impracticable to frame, andinsert in the constitution an election law, which wouldbe applicable to all possible changes in the situation ofthe country, and convenient for all the states. A discretionarypower over elections must be vested somewhere.There seemed but three ways, in which itcould be reasonably organized. It might be lodgedeither wholly in the national legislature ; or wholly in thestate legislatures ; or primarily in the latter, and ultimatelyin the former. The last was the mode adoptedby the convention. The regulation of elections issubmitted, in the first instance, to the local governments,which, in ordinary cases, and when no improperviews prevail, may both conveniently and satisfactorilybe by them exercised. But, in extraordinary circumstances,the power is reserved to the national government; so that it may not be abused, and thus hazard thesafety and permanence of the Union. Nor let it bethought,that such an occurrence is wholly imaginary.CH. XI.] ELECTIONS. 293It is a known fact, that, under the confederation,Rhode-island, at a very critical period, withdrew herdelegates from congress; and thus prevented some importantmeasures from being carried.^411. The objections, then, to the provision are notsound, or tenable. The reasons in its favour are, onthe other hand, of great force and importance. In thej&rst place, the power may be applied by congress tocorrect any negligence in a state in regard to elections,as well as to prevent a dissolution of the governmentby designing and refractory states, urged on by sometemporary excitements. In the next place, it will operateas a check in favour of the people against any designsof a federal senate, and their constituents, to deprivethe people of the state of their right to chooserepresentatives. In the next place, it provides a remedyfor the evil, if any state, by reason of invasion, orother cause, cannot have it in its power to appoint aplace, where the citizens can safely meet to chooserepresentatives. In the last place, (as the plan isbut an experiment,) it may hereafter become important,with a view to the regular operations of the generalgovernment, that there should be a uniformity in thetime and manner of electing representatives and senators,so as to prevent vacancies, when there may becalls for extraordinary sessions of congress. If such atime should occur, or such a uniformity be hereafterdesirable, congress is the only body possessing themeans to produce it.^412. It remains only to notice an exception to thepower of congress in this clause. It is, that congresscannot alter, or make regulations, " as to the place ofchoosing senators." This exception is highly reasonable.The choice is to be made by the state legislature;294 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.and it would not be either necessary, or becoming incongress, to prescribe the place, where it should sit.This exception was not in the revised draft of the constitution; and was adopted almost at the close of theconvention ; not, however, without some opposition, fornine states were in its favour, one against it, and onewas divided.§ 413. The second clause of the fourth section of thefirst article is as follows: "The congress shall assemble at"least once in every year; and such meeting shall be onthe first Monday in December, unless they shall bylawappoint a different day." This clause, for thefirst time, made its appearance in the revised draft ofthe constitution near the close of the convention ; andwas silently adopted, and, so far as can be perceived,without opposition. Annual parliaments had beenlong a favourite opinion and practice with the peopleof England ; and in America, under the colonial governments,they were justly deemed a great securityto public Puberty. The present provision could hardlybe overlooked by a free people, jealous of their rights ;and therefore the constitution fixed a constitutionalperiod, at which congress should assemble in everyyear, unless some other day was specially prescribed.Thus, the legislative discretion was necessarily bounded; and annual sessions were placed equally beyondthe power of faction, and of party, of power, and ofcorruption. In two of the states a more frequent assemblageof the legislature was known to exist. Butit was obvious, that from the nature of their duties, andthe distance of their abodes, the members of congressought not to be brought together at shorter periods,unless upon the most pressing exigencies. A provide.XI.] MEETINGS OF CONGRESS. 295sion, so universally acceptable, requires no vindication,or commentary.§ 414. The fifth section of the first article embracesprovisions principally applicable to the powers, rights,and duties of each house in its separate corporate character.These will not require much illustration or commentary,as they are such, as are usually delegated toall legislative bodies in free governments ; and were inpractice in Great-britain at the time of the emigrationof our ancestors; and were exercised under the colonialgovernments ; and have been secured and recognisedin the present state constitutions.^ 415. The first clause declares, that "each houseshall be the judge of the elections, returns, and qualificationsof its own members, and a majority of eachshall constitute a quorum to do business ; but a smallernumber may adjourn from day to day, and may beauthorized to compel the attendance of absent members,in such manner, and under such penalties, aseach house may provide."§ 416. It is obvious, that a power must be lodgedsomewhere to judge of the elections, returns, and qualificationsof the members of each house composing thelegislature ; for otherwise there could be no certainty,as to who were legitimately chosen members, and anyintruder, or usurper, might claim a seat, and thus trampleupon the rights, and privileges, and liberties of thepeople. Indeed, elections would become, under suchcircumstances, a mere mockery; and legislation theexercise of sovereignty by any self-constituted body.The only possible question on such a subject is, as tothe body, in which, such a power shall be lodged. Iflodged in any other, than the legislative body itself, itsindependence, its purity, and even its existence and296 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.action may be destroyed, or put into imminent danger.No other body, but itself, can have the same motives topreserve and perpetuate these attributes ; no otherbody can be so perpetually watchful to guard its ownrights and privileges from infringement, to purify andvindicate its own character, and to preserve the rights,and sustain the free choice of its constituents. Accordingly,the power has always been lodged in thelegislative body by the uniform practice of Englandand America.^417. The propriety of establishing a rule for aquorum for the despatch of business is equally clear ;since otherwise the concerns of the nation might bedecided by a very small number of the members ofeach body. In En.i>;land, where the house o[ commonsconsists of nearly six hundred members, the number offorty-five constitutes a quorum to do business. Insome of the state constitutions a particular number ofthe members constitutes a quorum to do business ; inothers, a majority is required. The constitution of theUnited States has wisely adopted the latter course ;and thus, by requiring a majority for a quorum, hassecured the public from any hazard of passing laws bysurprise, or against the deliberate opinion of a majorityof the representative body.§ 418. But, as a danger of an opposite sort requiredequally to be guarded against, a smaller number is authorizedto adjourn from day to day, thus to prevent alegal dissolution of the body, and also to compel theattendance of absent members. Thus, the interestsof the nation, and the despatch of business, are not subjectto the caprice, or perversity, or negligence of theminority. It was a defect in the articles of confederation,sometimes productive of great public mischief, thatCH. XI.] MEETINGS OF CONGRESS. 297no vote, except for an adjournment, could be determined,unless by the votes of a majority of the states ;and no power of compelling the attendance of the requisitenumber existed. ' ^Abr. 38298 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.CHAPTER XII.PRIVILEGES AND POWERS OF BOTH HOUSES OF Congress.^419. The next clause is, "each house may determinethe rules of its proceedings, punish its membersfor disorderly behaviour, and, with the concurrence oftwo thirds, expel a member." No person can doubtthe propriety of the provision authorizing each house todetermine the rules of its own proceedings. If the powerdid not exist, it would be utterly impracticable to transactthe business of the nation, either at all, or at leastwith decency, deliberation, and order. The humblestassembly of men is understood to possess this power;and it would be absurd to deprive the councils of thenation of a like authority. But the power to makerules would be nugatory, unless it was coupled witha power to punish for disorderly behaviour, or disobedienceto those rules. And as a member might be solost to all sense of dignity and duty, as to disgrace thehouse by the grossness of his conduct, or interrupt itsdeliberations by perpetual violence or clamour, thepowder to expel for very aggravated misconduct wasalso indispensable, not as a common, but as an ultimateredress for the grievance. But such a power, so summary,and at the same time so subversive of the rightsof the people, it was foreseen, might be exerted formere purposes of faction or party, to remove a patriot,or to aid a corrupt measure ; and it has therefore beenwisely guarded by the restriction, that there shall beaconcurrence of two thirds of the members, to justifyCH. XII.] PRIVILEGES OF CONGRESS. 299an expulsion. This clause, requiring a concurrence oftwo thirds, was not in the original draft of the constitution,but it was inserted by a vote of ten states, onebeing divided. A like general authority to expel, existsin the British house of commons ; and in the legislativebodies of many of the states composing theUnion.§ 420. The next clause is, " each house shall keepa journal of its proceedings, and from time to timepublish the same, except such parts, as may in their"judgment require secrecy. And the yeas and nays ofthe members of either house on any question shall, atthe desire of one fifth of those present, be entered onthe journal."§ 421. This clause in its actual form did not pass inthe convention without some struggle and some propositionsof amendment. The object of the whole clauseis to ensure publicity to the proceedings of the legislature,and a correspondent responsibility of the membersto their respective constituents. And it is foundedin sound policy and deep political foresight. Intrigueand cabal are thus deprived of some of theirmain resources, by plotting and devising measures insecrecy. The public mind is enlightened by an attentiveexamination of the public measures ; patriotism,and integrity, and wisdom obtain their due reward ;and votes are ascertained, not by vague conjecture, butby positive facts.^ 422. The restriction of calls of the yeas and naysto one fifth is founded upon the necessity of preventingtoo frequent a recurrence to this mode of ascertainingthe votes, at the mere caprice of an individual. A callconsumes a great deal of time, and often embarrassesthe just progress of beneficial measures. It is said to300 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.have been often used to excess in the congress underthe confederation ; and even under the present constitutionit is notoriously used, as an occasional annoyance,by a dissatisfied minority, to retard the passageof measures, which are sanctioned by the approbationof a strong majority. The check, therefore, is notmerely theoretical ; and experience shows, that it hasbeen resorted to, at once to admonish members, andto control them in this abuse of the public patience andthe public indulgence.^ 423. The next clause is, " neither house, duringthe session of congress, shall, without the consent ofthe other, adjourn for more than three days, nor toany other place, than that, in which the two housesshall be sitting." It is observable, that the durationof each session of congress, (subject to the constitutionaltermination of their official agency,) depends solelyupon their own will and pleasure, with the single exception,as will be presently seen, of cases, in which thetwo houses disagree in respect to the time of adjournment.In no other case is the president allowed tointerfere with the time and extent of their deliberations.And thus their independence is effectually guardedagainst any encroachment on the part of the executive.Very different is the situation of parliament under theBritish constitution ; for the king may, at any time, putan end to a session by a prorogation of parliament, orterminate the existence of parliament by a dissolution,and a call of a new parliament. It is true, that eachhouse has authority to adjourn itself separately; andthis is commonly done from day to day, and sometimesfor a week or a month together, as at Christmas andEaster, or upon other particular occasions. But the adjournmentof one house is not the adjournment of theCH. XII.] PRIVILEGES OF CONGRESS. 301Other. And it is usual, when the king signifies his pleasure,that both, or either of the houses should adjournthemselves to a certain day, to obey the king's pleasure,and adjourn accordingly ; for otherwise a prorogationwould certainly follow.^ 424. Under the colonial governments, the undueexercise of the same power by the royal governorsconstituted a great public grievance, and was one of thenumerous cases of misrule, upon which the declarationof independence strenuously relied. It was there solemnlycharged against the king, that he had called togetherlegislative [colonial] bodies at places unusual,uncomfortable, and distant from the repository of thepublic records ; that he had dissolved representativebodies, for opposing his invasions of the rights of thepeople ; and after such dissolutions, he had refused toreassemble them for a long period of time. It wasnatural, therefore, that the people of the United Statesshould entertain a strong jealousy on this subject, andshould interpose a constitutional barrier against any suchabuse by the prerogative of the executive. The stateconstitutions generally contain some provision on thesame subject, as a security to the independence of thelegislature.§ 425. These are all the powers and privileges,which are expressly vested in each house of congressby the constitution. What further powers and privilegesthey incidentally possess has been a question muchdiscussed, and may hereafter be open, as new casesarise, to still further discussion. It is remarkable, that nopower is conferred to punish for any contempts committedagainst either house; and yet it is obvious, that,unless such a power, to some extent, exists by implication,it is utterly impossible for either house to personCONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.form its constitutional functions. For instance, how iseither house to conduct its own deliberations, if it maynot keep out, or expel intruders ? If it may not require,and enforce upon strangers silence and decorum in itspresence ? If it may not enable its own members tohave free ingress, egress, and regress to its own hall oflegislation ? And if the power exists, by implication, torequire the duty, it is wholly nugatory, unless it drawsafter it the incidental authority to compel obedience,and to punish violations of it.§ 426. This subject has of late undergone a greatdeal of discussion both in England and America ; andhas finally received the adjudication of the highest judicialtribunals in each country. In each countryupon the fullest consideration the result was the same,viz. that the power did exist, and that the legislativebody was the proper and exclusive forum to decide,when the contempt existed, and when therewas a breach of its privileges ; and, that the power topunish followed, as a necessary incident, to the power totake cognizance of the offence.^ 427. The power to punish for contempts, thus assertedboth in England and America, is confined topunishment during the session of the legislative body,and cannot be extended beyond it. It seems, thatthe power of congress to punish cannot, in its utmostextent, proceed beyond imprisonment ; and then itterminates with the adjournment, or dissolution of thatbody.^ 428. The sixth section of the first article containsan enumeration of the rights, privileges, and disabilitiesof the members of each house in their personal and individualcharacters, as contradistinguished from therights, privileges, and disabilities of the body, of whichCH. XII.] PRIVILEGES OF CONGRESS. ^ 303they are members. It may here, again, be remarked,that these rights and privileges are, in truth, the rightsand privileges of their constituents, and for their benefitand security, rather than the rights and privileges ofthe member for his own benefit and security. In likemanner, the disabilities imposed are founded upon thesame comprehensive policy ; to guard the powers of therepresentative from abuse, and to secure a wise, impartial,and uncorrupt administration of his duties.^ 429. The first clause is as follows : " The senatorsand representatives shall receive a compensation fortheir services, to be ascertained by law and paid outof the treasury of the United States. They shall, inall cases, except treason, felony, and breach of thepeace, be privileged from arrest during their attendanceat the session of their respective houses, and ingoing to, and returning from, the same. And for anyspeech or debate in either house they shall not bequestioned in any other place."^ 430. Whether it is, on the whole, best to allow tomembers of legislative bodies a compensation for theirservices, or whether their services should be consideredmerely honorary, is a question admitting of muchargument on each side ; and it has accordingly foundstrenuous advocates, and opponents, not only in speculation,but in practice. It is well known, that in Englandnone is now allowed, or claimed ; and there can belitde doubt, that public opinion there is altogether infavour of their present course. On the other hand, inAmerica an opposite opinion prevails among thosewhose influence is most impressive with the people onsuch subjects. It is not surprising, that under suchcircumstances, there should have been a considerablediversity of opinion manifested in the convention itself.304 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.§ 431. The principal reasons in favour of a compensationmay be presumed to have been the following.In the first place, the advantage is secured of commandingthe first talents of the nation in the public councils,by removing a virtual disqualification, that of poverty,from that large class of men, who, though favoured bynature, might not be favoured by fortune. It couldhardly be expected, that such men would make thenecessary sacrifices in order to gratify their ambitionfor a public station ; and if they did, there was a correspondingdanger, that they might be compelled bytheir necessities, or tempted by their wants, to yieldup their independence, and perhaps their integrity, tothe allurements of the corrupt, or the opulent. In thenext place, it would, in a proportionate degree, gratifythe popular feeling by enlarging the circle of candidates,from which members might be chosen, and bringingthe office within the reach of persons in the middleranks of society, although they might not possess shiningtalents ; a course best suited to the equality found,and promulgated in a republic. In the next place, itwould make a seat in the national councils, as attractive,and perhaps more so, than in those of the state bythe superior emoluments of office. And in the lastplace it would be in conformity to a long and well settledpractice, which embodied public sentiment, andhad been sanctioned by public approbation.^ 432. On the other hand, it might be, and it was,probably, urged against it, that the practice of allowingcompensation was calculated to make the office rathermore a matter of bargain and speculation, than of highpolitical ambition. It would operate, as an inducementto vulgar and grovelling demagogues, of little talent,and narrow means, to defeat the claims of higher catch.XII.] PRIVILEGES OF CONGRESS. 305dictates, than themselves ; and with a view to the compensationalone to engage in all sorts of corrupt intriguesto procure their own election. It would thus degradethese high trusts from being deemed the reward ofdistinguished merit, and strictly honorary, to a meretraffic for political office, which would first corrupt thepeople at the polls, and then subject their liberties tobe bartered by their venal candidate. Men of talentsin this way would be compelled to degradation, in orderto acquire office, or would be excluded by moreunworthy, or more cunning candidates, who would feelthat the labourer was worthy of his hire. There is nodanger, that the want of compensation would determen of suitable talents and virtues, even in the humblerwalks of life, from becoming members ; since it couldscarcely be presumed, that the public gratitude wouldnot, by other means, aid them in their private business,and increase their just patronage. And if, in a fewcases, it should be otherwise, it should not be forgotten,that one of the most wholesome lessons to be taughtin republics is, that men should learn suitable economyand prudence in their private affairs ; and thatprofusion and poverty are, with a few splendid exceptions,equally unsafe to be entrusted with the publicrights and interests, since, if they do not betray, theycan hardly be presumed willing to protect them.The practice of England abundantly showed, that compensationwas not necessary to bring into public lifethe best talents and virtues of the nation. In lookingover her list of distinguished statesmen, of equal purityand patriotism, it would be found, that comparativelyfew had possessed opulence ; and many had struggledthrough life with the painful pressure of narrow resources,the res augusta domeAbr. 39306 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.^ 433. If it be proper to allow a compensation forservices to the members of congress, there seems theutmost propriety in its being paid out of the publictreasury of the United States. The labour is for thebenefit of the nation, and it should properly be remuneratedby the nation. Besides ; if the compensationwere to be allowed by the states, or by the constituentsof the members, if left to their discretion, it might keepthe latter in a state of slavish dependence, and mightintroduce great inequalities in the allowance. And ifit were to be ascertained by congress, and paid by theconstituents, there would always be danger, that therule would be fixed to suit those, who were the least enlightened,and the most parsimonious, rather than those,who acted upon a high sense of the dignity and theduties of the station. Fortunately, it is left for the decisionof congress. The compensation is " to be ascertainedby law ; " and never addresses itself to the pride,or the parsimony, the local prejudices, or local habits ofany part of the Union. It is fixed with a liberal viewto the national duties, and is paid from the national purse.If the compensation had been left, to be fixed by thestate legislature, the general government would havebecome dependent upon the governments of the states ;and the latter could almost, at their pleasure, have dissolvedit. Serious evils were felt from this source underthe confederation, by which each state was to maintainits own delegates in congress ; for it was found, that thestates too often were operated upon by local considerations,as contradistinguished from general and nationalinterests.§ 434. The only practical question, which seems tohave been farther open upon this head, is, whether thecompensation should have been ascertained by the conch.XII.] PRIVILEGES OF CONGRESS. 307situation itself, or left, (as it now is,) to be ascertainedfrom time to time by congress. If fixed by the constitution,it might, from the change of the value of money,and the modes of life, have become too low, and utterlyinadequate. Or it might have become too high in consequenceof serious changes in the prosperity of thenation. It is wisest, therefore, to have it left, where itis, to be decided by congress from time to time, accordingto their own sense of justice, and a large view ofthe national resources.^ 435. The next part of the clause regards the privilegeof the members from arrest, except for crimes,during their attendance at the sessions of congress, andtheir going to, and returning from them. This privilegeis conceded by law to the humblest suitor and witnessin a court of justice; and it would be strange, indeed,if it were denied to the highest functionaries ofthe state in the discharge of their public duties. Itbelongs to congress in common with all other legislativebodies, which exist, or have existed in America,since its first setdement, under every variety of government; and it has immemorially constituted a privilegeof both houses of the British parliament. It seemsabsolutely indispensable for the just exercise of thelegislative power in every nation, purporting to possessa free constitution of government ; and it cannot besurrendered without endangering the public liberties,as well as the private independence of the members.^ 436. The effect of this privilege is, that the arrestof the member is unlawful, and a trespass ah initio, forwhich he may maintain an action, or proceed against theaggressor by way of indictment. He may also be dischargedby motion to a court of justice, or upon a writ308 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.of habeas corpus ; and the arrest may also be punished,as a contempt of the house.§ 437. In respect to the time of going and returning,the law is not so strict in point of time, as to requirethe party to set out immediately on his return ; butallows him time to settle his private affairs, and to preparefor fees journey. Nor does it nicely scan his road,nor is his protection forfeited, by a little deviation fromthat, which is most direct; for it is supposed, that somesuperior convenience or necessity directed it. Theprivilege from arrest takes place by force of the election,and before the member has taken his seat, or issworn.^ 438. The exception to the privilege is, that it shallnot extend to " treason, felony, or breach of the peace*'These words are the same as those, in which the exceptionto the privilege of parliament is usually expressedat the common law, and was doubtless borrowedfrom that source. Now, as all crimes are offencesagainst the peace, the phrase " breach of the peace "would seem to extend to all indictable offences, as wellthose, which are, in fact, attended with force and violence,as those, which are only constructive breachesof the peace of the government, inasmuch as they violateits good order. And so in truth it was decided inparliament, in the case of a seditious libel, published bya member, (Mr. Wilkes,) against the opinion of LordCamden and the other judges of the Court of CommonPleas ; and, as it will probably now be thought, sincethe party spirit of those times has subsided, with entiregood sense, and in furtherance of public justice. Itwould be monstrous, that any member should protecthimself from arrest, or punishment for a libel, often acrime of the deepest malignity and mischief, while heCH. XII.] PRIVILEGES OF CONGRESS. 309would be liable to arrest for the pettiest assault, or themost insignificant breach of the peace.^ 439. The next great and vital privilege is the freedomof speech and debate, without which all otherprivileges would be comparatively unimportant, or ineffectual.This privilege also is derived from the practiceof the British parliament, and was in full exercisein our colonial legislatures, and now belongs to the legislatureof every state in the Union, as matter of constitutionalright. In the British parliament it is a claim ofimmemorial right, and is now farther fortified by an actof parliament ; and it is always particularly demandedof the king in person by the speaker of the house ofcommons, at the opening of every new parliament.But this privilege is strictly confined to things done inthe course of parliamentary proceedings, and does notcover things done beyond the place and limits of duty.Therefore, although a speech delivered in the house ofcommons is privileged, and the member cannot bequestioned respecting it elsewhere ; yet, if he publisheshis speech, and it contains libellous matter, he is liableto an action and prosecution therefor, as in commoncases of libel. And the same principles seem applicableto the privilege of debate and speech in congress.No man ought to have a right to defame others undercolour of a performance of the duties of his office. Andif he does so in the actual discharge of his duties incongress, that furnishes no reason, why he should beenabled through the medium of the press to destroythe reputation, and invade the repose of other citizens.It is neither within the scope of his duty, nor in furtheranceof public rights, or public policy. Every citizenhas as good a right to be protected by the laws frommalignant scandal, and false charges, and defamatory310 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.imputations, as a member of congress has to utter themin his seat. If it were otherwise, a man's charactermight be taken away without the possibility of redress,either by the malice, or indiscretion, or overweeningself-conceit of a member of congress. It is proper,however, to apprise the learned reader, that it hasbeen recently denied in congress by very distinguishedlawyers, that the privilege of speech and debate in congressdoes not extend to publication of his speech.And they ground themselves upon an important distinctionarising from the actual differences between Englishand American legislation. In the former, the publicationof the debates is not strictly lawful, except by h-cense of the house. In the latter, it is a common right,exercised and supported by the direct encouragementof the body. This reasoning deserves a very attentiveexamination.§ 440. The next clause regards the disqualificationof members of congress ; and is as follows : " 'No senatoror representative shall, during the time, for whichhe was elected, be appointed to any civil office underthe authority of the United States, which shall havebeen created, or the emoluments whereof shall havebeen increased, during such time. And no person,holding any office under the United States, shall beamember of either house of congress during his continuancein office." This clause does not appear tohave met with any opposition in the convention, as tothe propriety of some provision on the subject, theprincipal question being, as to the best mode of expressingthe disqualifications. It has been deemed by onecommentator an admirable provision against venality,though not perhaps sufficiently guarded to preventevasion. And it has been elaborately vindicated byCH. XII.] PRIVILEGES OF CONGRESS. 311another with uncommon earnestness. The reasonsfor excluding persons from offices, who have been concernedin creating them, or increasing their emoluments,are, to take away, as far as possible, any improper biasin the vote of the representative, and to secure to theconstituents some solemn pledge of his disinterestedness.The actual provision, however, does not go tothe extent of the principle ; for his appointment is restrictedonly " during the time, for which he was elected; " thus leaving in full force every influence uponhis mind, if the period of his election is short, or theduration of it is approaching its natural termination. Ithas sometimes been matter of regret, that the disqualificationhad not been made co-extensive with the supposedmischief; and thus to have for ever excludedmembers from the possession of offices created, or renderedmore lucrative, by themselves. Perhaps there isquite as much wisdom in leaving the provision, where itnow is.^ 441. The other part of the clause, which disqualifiespersons holding any office under the United Statesfrom being members of either house during their continuancein office, has been still more universally applauded; and has been vindicated upon the highestgrounds of public policy. It is doubdess founded in adeference to state jealousy, and a sincere desire to obviatethe fears, real or imaginary, that the general governmentwould obtain an undue preference over thestate governments. It has also the strong recommendation,that it prevents any undue influence from office,either upon the party himself, or those, with whom heis associated in legislative deliberations. The universalexclusion of all persons holding office is (it must beadmitted) attended with some inconveniences. The312 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.heads of the departments are, in fact, thus precludedfrom proposing, or vindicating their own measures inthe face of the nation in the course of debate ; and arecompelled to submit them to other men, who are eitherimperfectly acquainted with the measures, or are indifferentto their success or failure. Thus, that open andpublic responsibility for measures, which properly belongsto the executive in all governments, and especiallyin a republican government, as its greatest securityand strength, is completely done away. Theexecutive is compelled to resort to secret and unseen influence,to private interviews, and private arrangements,to accomplish its own appropriate purposes ; instead ofproposing and sustaining its owen duties and measuresby a bold and manly appeal to the nation in the face ofits representatives. One consequence of this state ofthings is, that there never can be traced home to theexecutive any responsibility for the measures, whichare planned, and carried at its suggestion. Anotherconsequence will be, (if it has not yet been,) that measureswill be adopted, or defeated by private intrigues,poUtical combinations, irresponsible recommendations,and all the blandishments of office, and all the deadeningweight of silent patronage. The executive willnever be compelled to avow, or to support any opinions.His ministers may conceal, or evade any expression oftheir opinions. He will seem to follow, when in facthe directs, the opinions of congress. He will assumethe air of a dependent instrument, ready to adopt theacts of the legislature, when in fact his spirit and hiswishes pervade the whole system of legislation. Ifcorruption ever eats its way silently into the vitals ofthis republic, it will be, because the people are unableto bring responsibility home to the executive throughCH. XII.] PRIVILEGES OF CONGRESS. 313his chosen ministers. They will be betrayed, whentheir suspicions are most lulled by the executive, underthe disguise of an obedience to the will of congress.If it would not have been safe to trust the heads of departments,as representatives, to the choice of the people,as their constituents, it would have been at leastsome gain to have allowed them a seat, like territorialdelegates, in the house of representatives, where theymight freely debate without a tide to vote. In such anevent, their influence, whatever it would be, would beseen, and felt, and understood, and on that accountwould have involved little danger, and more searchingjealousy and opposition ; whereas, it is now secret andsilent, and from that very cause may become overwhelming.§ 442. One other reason in favour of such a right is,that it would compel the executive to make appointmentsfor the high departments of government, notfrom personal or party favourites, but from statesmenof high public character, talents, experience, and elevatedservices ; from statesmen, who had earned publicfavour, and could command public confidence. At present,gross incapacity may be concealed under officialforms, and ignorance silently escape by shifting the laboursupon more intelligent subordinates in office. Thenation would be, on the other plan, better served ; andthe executive sustained by more masculine eloquence,as well as more liberal learning.§ 443. Such is the reasoning, by which many enlightenedstatesmen have not only been led to doubt,but even to deny the value of this constitutional disqualification.And even the most strenuous advocatesof it are compelled so far to admit its force, as to concede,that the measures of the executive government,Abr. 40314 COXSllltUOX OF THE C.

As cannot be Ae reason of then' halingAe soteqBJht of laiahgaBdnwdfffcieAB supply. The316 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.true reason seems to be this. The lords being a permanenthereditary body, created at pleasure by theking, are supposed more liable to be influenced by thecrown, and when once influenced, more likely to continueso, than the commons, who are a temporary electivebody, freely nominated by the people. It would,therefore, be extremely dangerous to give the lords anypower of framing new taxes for the subject. It is sufficient,that they have a power of rejecting, if* theythink the commons too lavish or improvident in theirgrants.^ 446. It will be at once perceived, that the samereasons do not exist in the same extent, for the sameexclusive right in our house of representatives in regardto money bills, as exist for such right in the Britishhouse of commons. It may be fit, that it shouldpossess the exclusive right to originate money bills ;since it may be presumed to possess more ample meansof local information, and it more directly represents theopinions, feelings, and wishes of the people. And, beingdirectly dependent upon them for support, it will bemore watchful and cautious in the imposition of taxes,than a body, which emanates exclusively from thestates in their sovereign political capacity. But, asthe senators are in a just sense equally representativesof the people, and do not hold their offices by a permanentor hereditary tide, but periodically return to thecommon mass of citizens ; and above all, as directtaxes are, and must be, apportioned among the statesaccording to their federal population ; and as all thestates have a distinct local interest, both as to theamount and nature of all taxes of every sort, which areto be levied, there seems a peculiar fitness in giving tothe senate a power to alter and amend, as well as toCH. XIII.] president's negative. 317concur with, or reject all money bills. The due influenceof all the states is thus preserved ; for otherwiseit might happen, from the overwhelming representationof some of the large states, that taxes might be levied,which would bear with peculiar severity upon the interests,either agricultural, commercial, or manufacturing,of others being the minor states ; and thus theequilibrium intended by the constitution, as well ofpower, as of interest, and influence, might be practicallysubverted.^ 447. There would also be no small inconveniencein excluding the senate from the exercise of this powerof amendment and alteration ; since if any, the slightestmodification were required in such a bill to make iteither palatable or just, the senate would be compelledto reject it, although an amendment of a single heightmake it entirely acceptable to both houses.Such a practical obstruction to the legislation of a freegovernment would far outweigh any supposed theoreticaladvantages from the possession or exercise of anexclusive power by the house of representatives. Infiniteperplexities, and misunderstandings, and delayswould clog the most wholesome legislation. Even theannual appropriation bills might be in danger of a miscarriageon these accounts ; and the most painful dissensionsmight be introduced.^ 448. The next clause respects the power of thepresident to approve, and negative laws. In the conventionthere does not seem to have been much diversityof opinion on the subject of the propriety of givingto the president a negative on the laws. The principalpoints of discussion seem to have been, whether thenegative should be absolute, or qualified ; and if thelatter, by what number of each house the bill should be318 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.subsequently passed, in order to become a law ; andwhether the negative should in either case be exclusivelyvested in the president alone, or in him jointlyy with some other department of the government.^ 449. Two points may properly arise upon thissubject. First, the propriety of vesting the power inthe president ; and secondly, the extent of the legislativecheck, to prevent an undue exercise of it. Theformer also admits of a double aspect, viz. whether thenegative should be absolute, or should be qualified.An absolute negative on the legislature appears, atfirst, to be the natural defence, with which the executivemagistrate should be armed. But in a free government,it seems not altogether safe, nor of itself asufficient defence. On ordinary occasions, it may notbe exerted with the requisite firmness ; and on extraordinaryoccasions, it may be perfidiously abused. Itis true, that the defect of such an absolute negative hasatendency to weaken the executive department. Butthis may be obviated, or at least counterpoised, by otherarrangements in the government ; such as a qualifiedconnexion with the senate in making treaties and appointments,by which the latter, being a stronger department,may be led to support the constitutional rightsof the former, without being too much detached fromits own legislative functions. And the patronage of theexecutive has also some tendency to create a counteractinginfluence in aid of his independence. It is true,that in England an absolute negative is vested in theking, as a branch of the legislative power ; and he possessesthe absolute power of rejecting, rather thanof resolving. And this is thought by Mr. Justice Blackstoneand others, to be a most important, and indeedindispensable part of the royal prerogative, to guard itCH. XIII.] president's negative. 315against the usurpations of the legislative authority.Yet in point of fact this negative of the king has notbeen once exercised since the year 1692 ; a fact, whichcan only be accounted for upon one of two suppositions,either that the influence of the crown has preventedthe passage of objectionable measures, or that theexercise of the prerogative has become so odious, thatit has not been deemed safe to exercise it, except uponthe most pressing emergencies. Probably both motiveshave alternately prevailed in regard to bills, whichwere disagreeable to the crown ; though, for the lasthalf century, the latter has had the most uniform anddecisive operation. As the house of commons becomesmore and more the representative of the popular opinion,the crown will have less and less inducement tohazard its own influence by a rejection of any favouritemeasure of the people. It will be more likely to takethe lead, and thus guide and moderate, instead of resistingthe commons. And, practically speaking, it isquite problematical, whether a qualified negative maynot hereafter in England become a more efficient protectionof the crown, than an absolute negative, whichmakes no appeal to the other legislative bodies, andconsequently compels the crown to bear the exclusiveodium of a rejection. Be this as it may, the exampleof England furnishes, on this point, no sufficient authorityfor America. The whole structure of our governmentis so entirely different, and the elements, of whichit is composed, are so dissimilar from that of England,that no argument can be drawn from the practice of thelatter, to assist us in a just arrangement of the executiveauthority.^ 450. The reasons, why the president should possessa qualified negative, if they are not quite obvious,320 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.are, at least, when fairly expounded, entirely satisfactory.In the first place, there is a natural tendency inthe legislative department to intrude upon the rights,and to absorb the powers of the other departments ofgovernment. A mere parchment delineation of theboundaries of each is wholly insufficient for the protectionof the weaker branch, as the executive unquestionablyis ; and hence there arises a constitutionalnecessity of arming it with powers for its own defence.If the executive did not possess this qualified negative,he would gradually be stripped of all his authority,and become, what it is well . known the governors ofsome states are, a mere pageant and shadow of magistracy'.§ 451. In the next place, the power is important, asan additional security against the enactment of rash,immature, and improper laws. It establishes a salutarycheck upon the legislative body, calculated to preservethe community against the effects of faction,precipitancy, unconstitutional legislation, and temporaryexcitements, as well as political hostility. It may,indeed, be said, that a single man, even though he bepresident, cannot be presumed to possess more wisdom,or virtue, or experience, than what belongs to anumber of men. But this furnishes no answer to thereasoning. The question is not, how much wisdom, orvirtue, or experience, is possessed by either branch ofthe government, (though the executive magistrate maywell be presumed to be eminently distinguished in allthese respects, and therefore the choice of the people ;)but whether the legislature may not be misled by alove of power, a spirit of faction, a political impulse, orapersuasive influence, local or sectional, which, at thesame time, may not, from the difference in the electionCH. XIII.] president's negative. 321and duties of the executive, reach him at all, or notreach him in the same degree. He will always have aprimary inducement to defend his own powers ; thelegislature may w^ell be presumed to have no desireto favour them. He will have an opportunity soberlyto examine the acts and resolutions passed by the legislature,not having partaken of the feelings or combinations,which have procured their passage, and thusto correct, what will sometimes be wrong from haste andinadvertence, as w-ell as design. His view of them, ifnot more wise, or more elevated, will, at least, be independent,and under an entirely different responsibilityto the nation, from what belongs to them. He is therepresentative of the whole nation in the aggregate ;they are the representatives only of distinct parts ;and sometimes of little more than sectional or local interests.§ 452. Nor is there any solid objection to this qualifiedpower. If it should be objected, that it may sometimesprevent the passage of good laws, as w^ell as ofbad laws, the objection is entided to but Httle weight.In the first place, it can never be effectually exercisedif two thirds of both houses are in favour of the law ; andif they are not, it is not so easily demonstrable, thatthe law is either wise or salutary. The presumptionwould rather be the other way ; or, at least, that theutility of it is not unquestionable, or it would receivethe requisite support. In the next place, the great evilof all free governments is a tendency to over-legislation ;and the mischief of inconstancy and mutability in thelaws forms a great blemish in the character and geniusof all free governments. The injury, which may possiblyarise from the postponement of a salutary law,is far less, than from the passage of a mischievous one,Abr. 41322 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.or from a redundant and vacillating legislation. In thenext place, there is no practical danger, that this powerwill be much, if any, abused by the president. Thesuperior weight and influence of the legislative body inafree government, and the hazard to the weight andinfluence of the executive in a trial of strength, afford asatisfactory security that the power will generally beemployed with great caution ; and that there will bemore often room for a charge of timidity, than of rashnessin its exercise. It has been already seen, that theBritish king, with all his sovereign attributes, has rarelyinterposed this high prerogative, and that more thanacentury has elapsed since its actual application. Iffrom the offensive nature of the power a royal hereditaryexecutive thus indulges serious scruples in itsactual exercise, surely a republican president, chosenfor four years, may be presumed to be still more unwillingto exert it.§ 453. It has this additional recommendation, as aqualified negative, that it does not, like an absolute negative,present a categorical and harsh resistance to thelegislative will, which is so apt to engender strife, andnourish hostility. It assumes the character of a mereappeal to the legislature itself, and asks a revision of itsown judgment. It is in the nature, then, merely of arehearing, or a reconsideration, and involves nothing toprovoke resentment, or rouse pride. A president, whomight hesitate to defeat a law by an absolute veto,might feel little scruple to return it for reconsiderationupon reasons and arguments suggested on the return.If these were satisfactory to the legislature, he wouldhave the cheering support of a respectable portion ofthe body in justification of his conduct. If, on the otherhand, they should not be satisfactory, the concurrenceCH. XIII.] president's negative. 323of two thirds would secure the ultimate passage of thelaw, without exposing him to undue censure or reproach.Even in such cases his opposition would notbe without some benefit. His' observations would becalculated to excite public attention and discussion, tolay bare the grounds, and policy, and constitutionallyof measures ; and to create a continued watchfulness, asto the practical effects of the laws thus passed, so asthat it might be ascertained by experience, whether hissagacity and judgment were safer, than those of the legislature.Nothing but a gross abuse of the power uponfrivolous, or party pretences, to secure a petty triumph,or to defeat a wholesome restraint, would bring it intocontempt, or odium. And then, it would soon be followedby that remedial justice from the people, in the exerciseof the right of election, which, first or last, willbe found to follow with reproof, or cheer with applause,the acts of their rulers, when passion and prejudicehave removed the temporary bandages, which havebanded their judgment.§ 454. The other point of inquiry is, as to the extentof the legislative check upon the negative of the executive.It was originally proposed, that a concurrence oftwo thirds of each house should be required ; thiswas subsequently altered to three fourths ; and wasfinally brought back again to the original number. Onereason against the three fourths seems to have been,that it would afford little security for any effectual exerciseof the power. The larger the number requiredto overrule the executive negative, the more easy itwould be for him to exert a silent and secret influenceto detach the requisite number in order to carry hisobject. Another reason was, that even, supposing nosuch influence to he exerted, still, in a great variety of324 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.cases of a political nature, and especially such, as touchedlocal or sectional interests, the pride or the power ofstates, it would be easy to defeat the most salutarymeasures, if a combination of a kw states could producesuch a result. And the executive himself might, fromhis local attachments or sectional feelings, partake ofthis common bias. In addition to this, the departurefrom the general rule, of the right of a majority to govern,ought not to be allowed but upon the most urgentoccasions. And an expression of opinion by two thirdsof both houses in favour of a measure certainly affordsall the just securities, which any wise, or prudent peopleought to demand in the ordinary course of legislation; for all laws thus passed may, at any time, berepealed at the mere will of the majority. It was alsono small recommendation of the lesser number, that itoffered fewer inducements to improper combinations,either of the great states, or the small states, to accomplishparticular objects. There could be but one oftwo rules adopted in all governments, either, that themajority should govern, or the minority should govern.The president might be chosen by a bare majority ofelectoral votes, and this majority might be by the combinationof a few large states, and by a minority of thewhole people. Under such circumstances, if a vote ofthree fourths were required to pass a law, the voice oftwo thirds of the people might be permanently disregardedduring a whole administration. The case putmay seem strong ; but it is not stronger, than the supposition,that two thirds of both houses would be foundready to betray the solid interests of their constituentsby the passage of injurious or unconstitutional laws.The provision, therefore, as it stands, affords all reasonablesecurity ; and pressed farther, it would endangerCH. XIII.] MODE OF PASSING LAWS. 325the very objects, for which it is introduced into theconstitution.§ 455. But the president might effectually defeat thewholesome restraint, thus intended, upon his qualifiednegative, if he might silently decline to act, after a billwas presented to him for approval or rejection. Theconstitution, therefore, has wisely provided, that "if anybill shall not he returned by the president within tendays (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presentedto him, it shall be a law, in like manner, as ifhe had signed it." But if this clause stood alone,congress might, in like manner, defeat the due exerciseof his qualified negative by a termination of thesession, which would render it impossible for the presidentto return the bill. It is therefore added, " unlessthe congress, by their adjournment, prevent its return,in which case it shall not be a law."^ 456. The remaining clause merely applies to orders,resolutions, and votes, to which the concurrenceof both houses may be necessary ; and as to these, witha single exception, the same rule is applied, as is by thepreceding clause applied to hills. If this provision hadnot been made, congress, by adopting the form of anorder or resolution, instead of a bill, might have effectuallydefeated the president's qualified negative in allthe most important portions of legislation.^ 457. A review of the forms and modes of proceedingin the passing of laws cannot fail to impressupon every mind the cautious steps, by which legislationis guarded, and the solicitude to conduct businesswithout precipitancy, rashness, or irregularity. Frequentopportunities are afforded to each house to reviewtheir own proceedings ; to amend their own errors; to correct their own inadvertence ; to recover326 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.from the results of any passionate excitement ; and toreconsider the votes, to which persuasive eloquence, orparty spirit, has occasionally misled their judgments.Under such circumstances, if legislation be unwise, orloose, or inaccurate, it belongs to the infirmity of humannature in general, or to that personal carelessnessand indifference, which is sometimes the foible ofgenius, as well as the accompaniment of ignorance andprejudice.^ 458. The structure and organization of the severalbranches, composing the legislature, have also (unlessmy judgment has misled me) been shown by the pastreview to be admirably adapted to preserve a wholesomeand upright exercise of their powers. All thechecks, which human ingenuity has been able to devise,(at least all, which, with reference to our habits, institutions,and local interests, seem practicable, or desirable,)to give perfect operation to the machineryof government ; to adjust all its movements ; to preventits eccentricities ; and to balance its forces ; — all thesehave been introduced, with singular skill, ingenuity, andwisdom, into the structure of the constitution.^ 459. Yet, after all, the fabric may fall; for thework of man is perishable, and must for ever have inherentelements of decay. Nay ; it must perish, ifthere be not that vital spirit in the people, which alonecan nourish, sustain, and direct all its movements. Itwill be in vain, that statesmen shall form plans of government,in which the beauty and harmony of a republicshall be embodied in visible order, shall be built up onsolid substructions, and adorned by every useful ornament,if the inhabitants suffer the silent power of timeto dilapidate its walls, or crumble its massy supportersinto dust ; if the assaults from without are never resist.XIII.] MODE OF PASSING LAWS. 327ed, and the rottenness and mining from within are neverguarded against. Who can preserve the rights andliberties of the people, when they are abandonedby themselves 1 Who shall keep watch in the temple,when the watchmen sleep at their posts ? Who shallcall upon the people to redeem their possessions, andrevive the republic, when their own hands have deliberatelyand corrupt surrendered them to the oppressor,and have built the prisons, or dug the graves of theirown friends ? Aristotle, in ancient times, upon a largesurvey of the republics of former days, and of the facilemanner, in which they had been made the instrumentsof their own destruction, felt himself compelled tothe melancholy reflection, which has been painfully repeatedby one of the greatest statesmen of moderntimes, that a democracy has many striking points of resemblancewith a tyranny. " The ethical character,"says he, " is the same ; both exercise despotism over thebetter class of citizens ; and the decrees are in the one,what ordinances and arrests are in the other. Thedemagogue too, and the court favourite are not unfrequentlythe same identical men, and always bear a closeanalogy. And these have the principal power, each intheir respective governments, favourites with the absolutemonarch, and demagogues with a people, such as Ihave described."^ 460. This dark picture, it is to be hoped, willnever be applicable to the republic of America. Andyet it affords a warning, which, like all the lessons ofpast experience, vie are not permitted to disregard.America, free, happy, and enlightened, as she is, mustrest the preservation of her rights and liberties uponthe virtue, independence, justice, and sagacity of thepeople. If either fail, the republic is gone. Its shadesCONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.ow may remain with all the pomp, and circumstance,and trickery of government ; but its vital power willhave departed. In America, the demagogue may arise,as well as elsewhere. He is the natural, though spuriousgrowth of republics ; and like the courtier he may,by his blandishments delude the ears, and blind theeyes of the people to their own destruction. If everthe day shall arrive, in which the best talents and thebest virtues shall be driven from office by intrigue orcorruption, by the ostracism of the press, or the stillmore unrelenting persecution of party, legislation willcease to be national. It will be wise by accident, andbad by system.CH. XIV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS. 329CHAPTER XIV.POWERS OF CONGRESS.^461. We have now arrived, in the course of ourinquiries, at the eighth section of the first article of theconstitution, which contains an enumeration of theprincipal powers of legislation confided to congress.A consideration of this most important subject willdetain our attention for a considerable time ; as well,because of the variety of topics, which it embraces,as of the controversies, and discussions, to which ithas given rise. It has been, in the past time, it is inthe present time, and it will probably in all futuretime continue to be, the debateable ground of theconstitution, signalized, at once, by the victories, andthe defeats of the same parties.§ 462. The first clause of the eighth section is inthe following words : " The congress shall have powerto lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises,to pay the debts and provide for the common defence,and general welfare of the United States ; but all*' duties, imposts, and excises, shall be uniform throughoutthe United States."^ 463. Before proceeding to consider the nature andextent of the power conferred by this clause, and thereasons, on which it is founded, it seems necessary tosettle the grammatical construction of the clause, andto ascertain its true reading. Do the words, " to layand collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises," constitutea distinct, substantial power ; and the words,*' to pay debts, and provide for the common defence,and general welfare of the United States," constituteAbr. 42330 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.another distinct and substantial power ? Or are thelatter words connected with the former, so as to constitutea qualification upon them ? This has been atopic of political controversy ; and has furnished abundantmaterials for popular declamation and alarm. Ifthe former be the true interpretation, then it is obvious,that under colour of the generality of the words toprovide for the common defence and general welfare,"the government of the United States is, in reality,a government of general and unlimited powers,notwithstanding the subsequent enumeration of specificpowers ; if the latter be the true construction, thenthe power of taxation only is given by the clause, andit is limited to objects of a national character, " forthe common defence and the general welfare."^ 464. The former opinion has been maintained bysome minds of great ingenuity, and liberality of views.The latter has been the generally received sense ofthe nation, and seems supported by reasoning at oncesolid and impregnable. The reading, therefore, whichwill be maintained in these commentaries, is that,which makes the latter words a qualification of theformer ; and this will be best illustrated by supplyingthe words, which are necessarily to be understoodin this interpretation. They will then standthus : " The congress shall have power to lay and'' collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, in orderto pay the debts, and to provide for the commondefence and general welfare of the United States ;"that is, for the purpose of paying the public debts, andproviding for the common defence and general welfareof the United States. In this sense, congress has notan unlimited power of taxation ; but it is limited tospecific objects, — the payment of the public debts,CH. XIV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS TAXES. 331and providing for the common defence and generalwelfare. A tax, therefore, laid by congress for neitherof these objects, would be unconstitutional, as an excessof its legislative authority. In what manner thisis to be ascertained, or decided, will be consideredhereafter. At present, the interpretation of the wordsonly is before us.^ 465. Having thus disposed of the question, whatis the true interpretation of the clause, as it stands inthe text of the constitution, and ascertained, that thepower of taxation, though general, as to the subjects,to which it may be applied, is yet restrictive, as tothe purposes, for which it may be exercised ; it nextbecomes matter of inquiry, what were the reasons, forwhich this power was given, and what were the objections,to which it was deemed liable.^ 466. That the power of taxation should be, tosome extent, vested in the national government, wasadmitted by all persons, who sincerely desired to escapefrom the imbecilities, as well as the inequalities of theconfederation. Without such a power it would notbe possible to provide for the support of the nationalforces by land or sea, or the national civil list, or theordinary charges and expenses of government. Forthese purposes at least, there must be a constant andregular supply of revenue. If there should be a deficiency,one of two evils must inevitably ensue ; eitherthe people must be subjected to continual arbitraryplunder ; or the government must sink into a fatalatrophy. The former is the fate of Turkey underits sovereigns : the latter was the fate of Americaunder the confederation.^ 467. If, then, there is to be a real, effective nationalgovernment, there must be a power of taxation332 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.co-extensive with its powers, wants, and duties. Theonly inquiry properly remaining is, whether the resourcesof taxation should be specified and limited ; or,whether the power in this respect should be general,leaving a full choice to the national legislature. Theopponents of the constitution strenuously contended,that the power should be restricted ; its friends, asstrenuously contended, that it was indispensable forthe public safety, that it should be general.^ 468. The general reasoning, by which an unlimitedpower was sustained, was to the following effect.Every government ought to contain within itself everypower requisite to the full accomplishment of the objectscommitted to its care, and the complete executionof the trusts, for which it is responsible, free fromevery other control, but a regard to the public good,and to the security of the people. In other words,every power ought to be proportionate to its object.The duties of superintending the national defence, andof securing the public peace against foreign or domesticviolence, involve a provision for casualties and dangers,to which no possible limits can be assigned ; andtherefore the power of making that provision oughtto know no other bounds, than the exigencies of thenation, and the resources of the community. Revenueis the essential engine, by which the means of answeringthe national exigencies must be procured ; andtherefore the power of procuring it must necessarilybe comprehended in that of providing for those exigencies.Theory, as well as practice, the past experienceof other nations, as well as our own sad experienceunder the confederation, conspire to prove, thatthe power of procuring revenue is unavailing, and amere mockery, when exercised over states in theirCH. XIV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS TAXES. 333collective capacities. If, therefore, the federal governmentvas to be of any efficiency, and a bond ofunion, it ought to be invested with an unqualifiedpower of taxation for all national purposes. In thehistory of mankind it has ordinarily been found, thatin the usual progress of things the necessities of a nationin every stage of its existence are at least equalto its resources. But, if a more favourable state ofthings should exist in our own government, still wemust expect reverses, and ought to provide againstthem. It is impossible to foresee all the variouschanges in the posture, relations, and power of differentnations, which may affect the prosperity andsafety of our own. We may have formidable foreignenemies. We may have internal commotions. Wemay suffer from physical, as well as moral calamities ;from plagues, famine, and earthquakes ; from politicalconvulsions, and rivalries ; from the gradual decline ofparticular sources of industry ; and from the necessityof changing our own habits and pursuits, in consequenceof foreign improvements and competitions, andthe variable nature of human wants and desires. Asource of revenue, adequate in one age, may whollyor partially fail in another. Commerce, or manufactures,or agriculture may thrive under a tax in oneage, which would destroy them in another. Thepower of taxation, therefore, to be useful, must notonly be adequate to all the exigencies of the nation,but it must be capable of reaching from time to timeall the most productive sources. It has been observedwith no less truth, than point, that '' in political arithmetictwo and two do not always make four." Constitutionsof government are not to be framed upon acalculation of existing exigencies ; but upon a combsCONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.nation of these with the probable exigencies of ages,according to the natural and tried course of humanaffairs. There ought to be a capacity to provide forfuture contingencies, as they may happen ; and as theseare (as has been already suggested) illimitable in theirnature, so it is impossible safely to limit that capacity.^ 469. In regard to other objections it was urged,that it was impossible to rely (as the history of the governmentunder the confederation abundantly proved)upon requisitions upon the states. Direct taxes wereexceedingly unequal, and difficult to adjust ; and couldnot safely be relied on, as an adequate or satisfactorysource of revenue, except as a final resort, when others,more eligible, failed. The distinction between externaland internal taxation was indeed capable of being reducedto practice. But in many emergencies it mightleave the national government without any adequateresources, and (compel it to a course of taxation ruinousto our trade and industry, and the solid interests of thecountry. No one of due reflection can contend, thatcommercial imports are, or could be, equal to all futureexigencies of the Union ; and indeed ordinarily theymay not be found equal to them. Suppose they areequal to the ordinary expenses of the Union ; yet, ifwar should come, the civil list must be entirely overlooked,or the military left without any adequate supply.How is it possible, that a government half suppliedand half necessitous can fulfil the purposes of itsinstitution, or can provide for the security, advancethe prosperity, or support the reputation of the commonwealth? How can it ever possess either energyor stability, dignity or credit, confidence at home, orrespectability abroad ? How can its administrationbe any thing else, than a succession of expedients,CH. XIV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS TAXES. 335temporary, impotent, and disgraceful ? How will itbe able to avoid a frequent sacrifice of its engagementsto immediate necessity ? How can it undertake, orexecute any liberal or enlarged plans of public good ?Who would lend to a government, incapable of pledgingany permanent resources to redeem its debts ? Itwould be the common case of needy individuals, whomust borrow upon onerous conditions and usury, becausethey cannot promise a punctilious discharge oftheir engagements. It would, therefore, not only notbe wise, but be the extreme of folly to stop short ofadequate resources for all emergencies, and to leavethe government entrusted with the care of the nationaldefence in a state of total, or partial incapacity to providefor the protection of the community against futureinvasions of the public peace by foreign war, or domesticconvulsions. If, indeed, we are to try the novel,not to say absurd, experiment in politics, of tying upthe hands of government from protective and offensivewar, founded upon reasons of state, we ought certainlyto be able to compel foreign nations to abstain fromall measures, which shall injure, or cripple us. Wemust be able to repress their ambition, and disarmtheir enmity ; to conquer their prejudices, and destroytheir rivalries and jealousies. Who is so visionary, asto dream of such a moral influence in a republic overthe whole world ? It should never be forgotten, thatthe chief sources of expense in every governmenthave ever arisen from wars and rebellions, from foreignambition and enmity, or from domestic insurrectionsand factions. And it may well be presumed, thatw hat has been in the past, will continue to be in thefuture.^ 470. The states, with a concurrent power, willSc CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.be entirely safe, and have ample resources to meet alltheir wants, whatever they may be, although few publicexpenses, comparatively speaking, will fall to their lottoprovide for. They will be chiefly of a domesticcharacter, and affecting internal polity ; whereas, theresources of the Union will cover the vast expenditures,occasioned by foreign intercourse, wars, andother charges necessary for the safety and prosperityof the Union. The mere civil list of any country isalways small ; the expenses of armies, and navies, andforeign relations unavoidably great. There is no soundreason, why the states should possess any exclusivepower over sources of revenue, not required by theirwants. But there is the most urgent propriety in concedingto the Union all, which may be commensurateto their wants. Any attempt to discriminate betweenthe sources of revenue would leave too much, or toolittle to the states. If the exclusive power of externaltaxation were given to the Union, and of internal taxationto the states, it would, at a rough calculation,probably give to the states a command of two thirdsof the resources of the community, to defray from atenth to a twentieth of its expenses ; and to the Union,one third of the resources of the community, to defrayfrom nine tenths to nineteen twentieths of its expenses.Such an unequal distribution is wholly indefensible.And it may be added, that the resources of the Unionwould, or might be diminished exactly in proportionto the increase of demands upon its treasury ; for (ashas been already seen) war, which brings the greatexpenditures, narrows, or at least may narrow the resourcesof taxation from duties on imports to a veryalarming degree. If we enter any other line of discrimination,it will be equally difficult to adjust therCH. XIV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS TAXES. 337proper proportions ; for the inquiry itself, in respectto the future wants, as well of the states, as of theUnion, and their relative proportion, must involve elements,for ever changing, and incapable of any preciseascertainment. Too much, or loo little would for everbe found to belong to the states ; and the states, aswell as the Union, might be endangered by the veryprecautions to guard against abuses of power. Anyseparation of the subjects of revenue, which could havebeen fallen upon, would have amounted to a sacrificeof the interests of the Union to the power of the individualstates ; or of a surrender of important functionsby the latter, which would have removed them to amean provincial servitude, and dependence.^471. The language of the constitution is, " Congressshall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties,imposts, and excises," &c. " But all duties, imposts,and excises shall be uniform throughout the UnitedStates." A distinction is here taken between taxes,and duties, imposts, and excises ; and, indeed, thereare other parts of the constitution respecting the taxingpower, (as will presently be more fully seen,) such asthe regulations respecting direct taxes, the prohibitionof taxes or duties on exports by the United States,and the prohibition of imposts or duties by the stateson imports or exports, which require an attention tothis distinction.^ 472. In a general sense, all contributions imposedby the government upon individuals for the service ofthe state, are called taxes, by whatever name they maybeknown, whether by the name of tribute, tythe,talliage, impost, duty, gael, custom, subsidy, aid,supply, excise, or other name. In this sense, theyare usually divided into two great classes, those, whichAbr. 43338 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.are direct, and those, which are indirect. Under theformer denomination are included taxes on land, orreal property, and under the latter, taxes on articlesof consumption. The constitution, bj giving thepower to lay and collect taxes in general terms,doubtless meant to include all sorts of taxes, whetherdirect or indirect. But, it may be asked, if such wasthe intention, why were the subsequent words, duties,imposts and excises, added in the clause ? Two reasonsmay be suggested ; the first, that it was done to avoidall possibility of doubt in the construction of the clause,since, in common parlance, the word taxes is sometimesapplied in contradistinction to duties, imposts,and excises, and, in the delegation of so vital a power,it was desirable to avoid all possible misconception ofthis sort ; and, accordingly, we find, in the very firstdraft of the constitution, these explanatory words areadded. Another reason was, that the constitutionprescribed different rules of laying taxes in differentcases, and, therefore, it was indispensable to make adiscrimination between the classes, to which each rulewas meant to apply.^ 473. The second section of the first article, whichhas been already commented on for another purpose,declares, that " direct taxes shall be apportioned amongthe several states, which may be included within thisUnion, according to their respective numbers." Thefourth clause of the ninth section of the same article(which would regularly be commented on in a futurepage) declares, that " no capitation, or other direct*' tax, shall be laid, unless in proportion to the censusor enumeration herein before directed to be taken ;"and the clause now under consideration, that " allduties, imposts, and excises shall be uniform through.XIV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS TAXES. 339*' out the United States." Here, then, two rules areprescribed, the rule of apportionment (as it is called)for direct taxes, and the rule of uniformity for dutiesimposts and excises. If there are any other kinds oftaxes, not embraced in one or the other of these twoclasses, (and it is certainly difficult to give full effectto the words of the constitution without supposingthem to exist,) it would seem, that congress is left atfull liberty to levy the same by either rule, or by amixture of both rules, or perhaps by any other rule,not inconsistent with the general purposes of the constitution.It is evident, that " duties, imposts, andexcises" are indirect taxes in the sense of the constitution.But the difficulty still remains, to ascertainwhat taxes are comprehended under this description ;and what under the description of direct taxes.^ 474. The word " duties " has not, perhaps, in allcases a very exact signification, or rather it is usedsometimes in a larger, and sometimes in a narrowersense. In its large sense, it is very nearly an equivalentto taxes, embracing all impositions or chargeslevied on persons or things. In its more restrainedsense, it is often used as equivalent to " customs,"which appellation is usually applied to those taxes,which are payable upon goods and merchandise imported,or exported, and was probably given on accountof the usual and constant demand of them for the useof kings, states, and governments. In this sense, itis nearly synonymous with '' imposts," which is sometimesused in the large sense of taxes, or duties, orimpositions, and sometimes in the more restrainedsense of a duty on imported goods and merchandise.§ 475. " Excises" are generally deemed to be of anopposite nature to " imposts," in the restrictive sense340 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.of the latter term, and are defined to be an inland imposition,paid sometimes upon the consumption of thecommodity, or frequently upon the retail sale, whichis the last stage before the consumption.^ 476. But the more important inquiry is, what aredirect taxes in the sense of the constitution, since theyare required to be laid by the rule of apportionment,and all indirect taxes, whether they fall under the headof ^' duties, imposts, or excises," or under any otherdescription, may be laid by the rule of uniformity. Itis clear, that capitation taxes, or, as they are morecommonly called, poll taxes, that is, taxes upon thepolls, heads, or persons, of the contributors, are directtaxes, for the constitution has expressly enumeratedthem, as such. " No capitation, or other direct tax,shall be laid," &c. is the language of that instrument.^ 477. Taxes on lands, houses, and other permanentreal estate, or on parts or appurtenances thereof, havealways been deemed of the same character, that is,direct taxes. It has been seriously doubted, if, in thesense of the constitution, any taxes are direct taxes,except those on polls or on lands.^ 478. In the year 1794, congress passed an act,laying duties upon carriages for the conveyance of persons,which were kept by or for any person, for hisown use, or to be let out to hire, or for the conveyingof passengers, to wit, for every coach the yearly sumof ten dollars, &c. &c. ; and made the levy uniformthroughout the United States, The constitutionalityof the act was contested, upon the ground, that itwas a direct tax, and so ought to be apportionedamong the states according to their numbers.After solemn argument, the Supreme Court decided,that it was not a direct tax within the meaning ofCH. XIV.J POWERS OF CONGRESS TAXES. 341the constitution. The grounds of this decision, asStated in the various opinions of the judges, were ;first, the doubt, whether any taxes were direct in thesense of the constitution, but capitation and land taxes,as has been already suggested ; secondly, that in casesof doubt, the rule of apportionment ought not to befavoured, because it was matter of compromise, and initself radically indefensible and wrong ; thirdly, themonstrous inequality and injustice of the carriage tax,if laid by the rule of apportionment, which would show,that no tax of this sort could have been contemplatedby the convention, as within the rule of apportionment; fourthly, that the terms of the constitutionwere satisfied by confining the clause, respecting directtaxes, to capitation and land taxes ; fifthly, that,accurately speaking, all taxes on expenses or consumptionare indirect taxes, and a tax on carriages isof this kind ; and, sixthly, (what is probably of mostcogency and force, and of itself decisive,) that no taxcould be a direct one in the sense of the constitution,which was not capable of apportionment according tothe rule laid down in the constitution.^ 479. Having endeavoured to point out the leadingdistinctions between direct and indirect taxes, and thatduties, imposts, and excises, in the sense of the constitution,belong to the latter class, the order of the subjectwould naturally lead us to the inquiry, why directtaxes are required to be governed by the rule of apportionment; and why " duties, imposts, and excises "are required to be uniform throughout the United States.The answer to the former will be given, when we cometo the farther examination of certain prohibitory andrestrictive clauses of the constitution on the subject oftaxation. The answer to the latter may be given in a342 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.few words. It was to cut off all undue preferences ofone state over another in the regulation of subjectsaffecting their common interests. Unless duties, imposts,and excises were uniform, the grossest and mostoppressive inequalities, vitally affecting the pursuits andemployments of the people of different states, mightexist. The agriculture, commerce, or manufactures ofone state might be built up on the ruins of those ofanother ; and a combination of a few states in congressmight secure a monopoly of certain branches of tradeand business to themselves, to the injury, if not to thedestruction, of their less favoured neighbors. The constitutionthroughout all its provisions is an instrumentof checks, and restraints, as well as of powers. Itdoes not rely on confidence in the general governmentto preserve the interests of all the states. It is foundedin a wholesome and strenuous jealousy, which,foreseeing the possibility of mischief, guards with solicitudeagainst any exercise of power, which may endangerthe states, as far as it is practicable. If thisprovision, as to uniformity of duties, had been omitted,although the power might never have been abused tothe injury of the feebler states of the Union, (a presumption,which history does not justify us in deemingquite safe or certain ;) yet it would, of itself, havebeen sufficient to demolish, in a practical sense, thevalue of most of the other restrictive clauses in theconstitution. New York and Pennsylvania might, byan easy combination with the Southern states, havedestroyed the whole navigation of New England. Acombination of a different character, between the NewEngland and the Western states, might have bornedown the agriculture of the South ; and a combinationof a yet different character might have struck at theCH. XIV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS TAXES. 343vital interests of manufactures. So that the generalpropriety of this clause is established by its intrinsicpolitical wisdom, as well as by its tendency to quietalarms, and suppress discontents.§ 480. Two practical questions of great importancehave arisen upon the construction of this clause, eitherstanding alone, or in connexion with other clauses, andincidental powers, given by the constitution. One is,whether the government has a right to lay taxes for anyother purpose than to raise revenue, however muchthat purpose may be for the common defence, or generalwelfare. The other is, whether the money, whenraised, can be appropriated to any other purposes, thansuch, as are pointed out in the other enumerated powersof congress. The former involves the question,whether congress can lay taxes to protect and encouragedomestic manufactures ; the latter, whether congresscan appropriate money to internal improvements.Each of these questions has given rise to much animatedcontroversy ; each has been affirmed and denied,with great pertinacity, zeal, and eloquent reasoning ;each has become prominent in the struggles of party ;and defeat in each has not hitherto silenced opposition,or given absolute security to victory. The contest isoften renewed ; and the attack and defence maintainedwith equal ardour.^ 481. It is unnecessary to consider the argumentat present, so far as it bears upon the constitutionalauthority of congress to protect or encourage manufactures; because that subject will more properly comeunder review, in all its bearings, under another head,viz. the power to regulate commerce, to which it isnearly allied, and from which it is more usually derived.Stripping the argument against the power of this CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.adventitious circumstance, it resolves itself into this statement.The power to lay taxes is a power exclusive! j givento raise revenue, and it can constitutionally be appliedto no other purposes. The application for other purposesis an abuse of the power ; and, in fact, howeverit may be inform disguised, it is a premeditated usurpationof authority. Whenever money or revenue iswanted for constitutional purposes, the power to laytaxes may be applied to obtain it. Whenever moneyor revenue is not so wanted, it is not a proper meansfor any constitutional end.^ 482. The argument in favour of the constitutionalauthority is grounded upon the terms and the intentof the constitution. It seeks for the true meaning andobjects of the power according to the obvious sense ofthe language, and the nature of the government proposedto be established by that instrument, it reliesupon no strained construction of words ; but demandsa fair and reasonable interpretation of the clause, withoutany restrictions not naturally implied in it, or inthe context. It will not do to assume, that the clausewas intended solely for the purposes of raising revenue ;and then argue, that being so, the power cannot beconstitutionally applied to any other purposes. Thevery point in controversy is, whether it is restrictedto purposes of revenue. That must be proved ; andcannot be assumed, as the basis of reasoning.^ 483. The language of the constitution is, " Congressshall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties,imposts, and excises." If the clause had stoppedhere, and remained in this absolute form, (as it was infact, when reported in the first draft in the convention,)there could not have been the slightest doubt onthe subject. The absolute power to lay taxes includesCH. XIV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS TAXES. 345the power in every form, in which it may be used,and for every purpose, to which the legislature maychoose to apply it. This results from the very natureof such an unrestricted power. A fortiori it mightbe applied by congress to purposes, for which nationshave been accustomed to apply it. Now, nothingis more clear, from the history of commercial nations,than the fact, that the taxing power is often, veryoften, applied for other purposes, than revenue. It isoften applied, as a regulation of commerce. It isoften applied, as a virtual prohibition upon the importationof particular articles, for the encouragementand protection of domestic products, and industry ; forthe support of agriculture, commerce, and manufactures; for retaliation upon foreign monopolies and injuriousrestrictions ; for mere purposes of state policy,and domestic economy ; sometimes to banish a noxiousarticle of consumption ; sometimes, as a bounty uponan infant manufacture, or agricultural product ; sometimes,as a temporary restraint of trade ; sometimes,as a suppression of particular employments ; sometimes,as a prerogative power to destroy competition,and secure a monopoly to the government !^ 484. If, then, the power to lay taxes, being general,may embrace, and in the practice of nations doesembrace, all these objects, either separately, or incombination, upon what foundation does the argumentrest, which assumes one object only, to the exclusionof all the rest ? which insists, in effect, that becauserevenue may be one object, therefore it is the soleobject of the power ? which assumes its own constructionto be correct, because it suits its own theory,and denies the same right to others, entertaining adifferent theory ? If the power is general in its terms,Mr, 44346 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.is it not an abuse of all fair reasoning to insist, that itis particular ? to desert the import of the language,and to substitute other and different language ? Isthis allowable in regard to any instrument ? Is it allowablein an especial manner, as to constitutions ofgovernment, growing out of the rights, duties, andexigencies of nations, and looking to an infinite varietyof circumstances, which may require very differentapplications of a given power ?^ 485. The other question is, whether congress hasany power to appropriate money, raised by taxation orotherwise, for any other purposes, than those pointedout in the enumerated powers, which follow the clauserespecting taxation. It is said, " raised by taxation orotherwise ;" for there may be, and in fact are, othersources of revenue, by which money may, and doescome into the treasury of the United States otherwise,than by taxation ; as, for instance, by fines, penalties,and forfeitures ; by sales of the public lands, and interestsand dividends on bank shocks ; by captures andprize in times of war ; and by other incidental profitsand emoluments growing out of governmental transactionsand prerogatives. But, for all the common purposesof argument, the question may be treated, as onegrowing out of levies by taxation.§ 486. The reasoning, upon which the opinion, adverseto the authority of congress to make appropriationsnot within the scope of the enumerated powers,is maintained, has been already, in a great measure,stated in the preceding examination of the grammaticalconstruction of the clause, giving the power to laytaxes. The controversy is virtually at an end, if itis once admitted, that the words, " to provide for thecommon defence and general welfare," are a part andCH. XIV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS TAXES. 347qualification of the power to lay taxes ; for then, congresshas certainly a right to appropriate money to anypurposes, or i^ any manner, conducive to those ends.The whole stress of the argument is, therefore, to establish,that the words, " to provide for the commondefence and general welfare," do not form an independentpower, nor any qualification of the power to laytaxes. And the argument is, that they are " meregeneral terms, explained and limited by the subjoinedspecifications." It is attempted to be fortified bya recurrence to the history of the confederation ; tothe successive reports and alterations of the taxclause in the convention ; to the inconveniencies ofsuch a large construction ; and to the supposed impossibility,that a power to make such appropriationsfor the common defence and general welfare,should not have been, at the adoption of the constitution,a subject of great alarm, and jealousy ; and assuch, resisted in and out of the state conventions.§ 487. The argument in favour of the power is derived,in the first place, from the language of theclause, conferring the power, (which it is admitted inits literal terms covers it ;) secondly, from the natureof the power, which renders it in the highest degreeexpedient, if not indispensable for the due operationsof the national government ; thirdly, from the early,constant and decided maintenance of it by the governmentand its functionaries, as well as by many of ourablest statesmen from the very commencement of theconstitution. So, that it has the language and intentof the text, and the practice of the government to sustainit against an artificial doctrine, set up on theother side.^ 488. The argument derived from the words and348 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.intent has been so fully considered already, that itcannot need repetition. It is summed up with greatforce in the report of the secretary of the treasury onmanufactures, in 1791. " The national legislature,"says he, '' has express authority to lay and collect taxes,duties, imposts, and excises ; to pay the debts andprovide for the common defence and general welfare,with no other qualifications, than that all other duties,imposts, and excises, shall be uniform throughout theUnited States ; that no capitation or other direct taxshall be laid, unless in proportion to numbers ascertainedby a census, or enumeration taken on the principleprescribed in the constitution ; and that no tax orduty shall be laid on articles exported from any state.These three qualifications excepted, the power to raisemoney is plenary and indefinite. And the objects, towhich it may be appropriated, are no less comprehensive,than the payment of the public debts, and theproviding for the common defence and general welfare.Time terms ' general welfare ' were doubtless intendedto signify more, than was expressed or imported inthose, which preceded ; otherwise numerous exigencies,incident to the affairs of the nation, would havebeen left without a provision. The phrase is as comprehensive,as any, that could have been used ; becauseit was not fit, that the constitutional authority of theUnion to appropriate its revenues should have beenrestricted within narrower limits, than the generalwelfare ; and because this necessarily embraces a vastvariety of particulars, which are susceptible neither ofspecification, nor of definition. It is, therefore, of necessityleft to the discretion of the national legislatureto pronounce upon the objects, which concern thegeneral welfare, and for which, under that description,tCH. XIV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS TAXES. 349an appropriation of money is requisite and proper.And there seems no room for a doubt, that whateverconcerns the general interests of learning, of agriculture,of manufactures, and of commerce, are withinthe sphere of the national councils, so far as regardsan application of money. The only qualification ofthe generality of the phrase in question, which seemsto be admissible, is this ; that the object, to which anappropriation of money is to be made, must be general,and not local ; its operation extending in fact, or bypossibility, throughout the Union, and not being confinedto a particular spot. No objection ought to ariseto this construction from a supposition, that it wouldimply a power to do, whatever else should appear tocongress conducive to the general welfare. A powerto appropriate money with this latitude, which isgranted in express terms, would not carry a power todoany other thing, not authorized in the constitutioneither expressly, or by fair implication."§ 489. In regard to the practice of the government,it has been entirely in conformity to the principles herelaid down. Appropriations have never been limitedby congress to cases falling within the specific powersenumerated in the constitution, whether those powersbe construed in their broad, or their narrow sense.And in an especial manner appropriations have beenmade to aid internal improvements of various sorts, inour roads, our navigation, our streams, and other objectsof a national character and importance. In somecases, not silently, but upon discussion, congress hasgone the length of making appropriations to aid destituteforeigners, and cities labouring under severe calamities; as in the relief of the St. Domingo refugees,in 1794, and the citizens of Venezuela, who suffered350 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.from an earthquake in 1812, An illustration, equallyforcible, of a domestic character, is in the bountygiven in the cod-fisheries, which was strenuously resistedon constitutional grounds in 1792 ; but whichstill maintains its place in the statute book of theUnited States.^ 490. In order to prevent the necessity of recurringagain to the subject of taxation, it seems desirable tobring together, in this connexion, all the remainingprovisions of the constitution on this subject, thoughthey are differently arranged in that instrument. Thefirst one is, " no capitation or other direct tax shall be*' laid, unless in proportion to the census, or enumeration,herein before directed to be taken." This includespoll taxes, and land taxes, as has been alreadyremarked.^ 491. The object of this clause doubtless is, tosecure the Southern states against any undue proportionof taxation ; and, as nearly as practicable, toovercome the necessary inequalities of a direct tax.The South have a very large slave population ; andconsequently a poll tax, which should be laid by therule of uniformity, would operate with peculiar severityon them. It would tax their property beyond itssupposed relative value, and productiveness to whitelabour. Hence, a rule is adopted, which, in effect,in relation to poll taxes, exempts two fifths of allslaves from taxation ; and thus is supposed to equalizethe burthen with the white population.^ 492. In respect to direct taxes on land, the difficultiesof making a due apportionment, so as to equalizethe burthens and expenses of the Union accordingto the relative wealth and ability of the states, wasfelt as a most serious evil under the confederation.CH. XIV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS —-taxes. 351By that instrument, (it will be recollected,) the apportionmentwas to be among the states according to thevalue of all land within each state, granted or surveyedfor any person, and the buildings and improvementsthereon, to be estimated in such mode, as congressshould prescribe. The whole proceedings to accomplishsuch an estimate were so operose and inconvenient,that congress, in April, 1783, recommended, asasubstitute for the article, an apportionment, foundedon the basis of population, adding to the whole numberof white and other free citizens and inhabitants, includingthose bound to service for a term of years,three fifths of all other persons, &:c. in each state ;which is precisely the rule adopted in the constitution.^ 493. Those, who are accustomed to contemplatethe circumstances, which produce and constitute nationalwealth, must be satisfied, that there is no commonstandard, by which the degrees of it can be ascertained.Neither the value of lands, nor the numbersof the people, which have been successively proposed,as the rule of state contributions, has any pretensionto being deemed a just representative of thatwealth. If we compare the wealth of the Netherlandswith that of Russia or Germany, or even of France,and at the same time compare the total value of thelands, and the aggregate population of the contractedterritory of the former, with the total value of thelands, and the aggregate population of the immenseregions of either of the latter kingdoms, it will be atonce discovered, that there is no comparison betweenthe proportions of these two subjects, and that of therelative wealth of those nations. If a like parallel berun between the American states, it will furnish asimilar result. Let Virginia be contrasted with CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.sachusetts, Pennsylvania with Connecticut, Marylandwith Virginia, Rhode-island with Ohio, and the disproportionwill be at once perceived. The wealth ofneither will be found to be, in proportion to numbers,or the value of lands.^ 494. The truth is, that the wealth of nations dependsupon an infinite variety of causes. Situation,soil, climate ; the nature of the productions ; the natureof the government ; the genius of the citizens ; thedegree of information they possess ; the state of commerce,of arts, and industry ; the manners and habitsof the people ; these, and many other circumstances,too complex, minute, and adventitious to admit of aparticular enumeration, occasion differences, hardlyconceivable, in the relative opulence and riches of differentcountries. The consequence is, that there canbe no common measure of national wealth ; and, ofcourse, no general rule, by which the ability of astate to pay taxes can be determined. The estimate,however fairly or deliberately made, is. open to manyerrors and inequalities, which become the fruitfulsource of discontents, controversies, and heart-burnings.These are sufficient, in themselves, to shakethe foundations of any national government, when nocommon artificial rule is adopted to settle permanentlythe apportionment ; and every thing is left open fordebate, as often as a direct tax is to be imposed.Even in those states, where direct taxes are constantlyresorted to, every new valuation or apportionment isfound, practically, to be attended with great inconvenience,and excitements. In short, it may be affirmedwithout fear of contradiction, that some artificialrule of apportionment of a fixed nature is indispensableto the public repose ; and considering theCH. XIV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS TAXES. 353peculiar situation of the American states, and especiallyof the slave and agricultural states, it is difficultto find any rule of greater equality or justice, thanthat, which the constitution has adopted.^ 495. The next clause in the constitution is : '' Notax or duty shall be laid on articles exported fromany state. No preference shall be given by any regulationof commerce, or revenue, to the ports of one*' state over those of another ; nor shall vessels bound*' to, or from one state be obliged to enter, clear, orpay duties in another."§ 496. The obvious object of these provisions is, toprevent any possibility of applying the power to laytaxes, or regulate commerce, injuriously to the interestsof any one state, so as to favour or aid another.If congress were allowed to lay a duty on exportsfrom any one state it might unreasonably injure, oreven destroy, the staple productions, or common articlesof that state. The inequality of such a tax wouldbe extreme. In some of the states, the whole of theirmeans result from agricultural exports. In others, agreat portion is derived from other sources ; from externalfisheries ; from freights ; and from the profits ofcommerce in its largest extent. The burthen of sucha tax would, of course, be very unequally distributed.The power to intermeddle with the subject of exportsis, therefore, wholly taken away. On the otherhand, preferences might be given to the ports of onestate by regulations, either of commerce or revenue,which might confer on them local facilities or privilegesin regard to commerce, or revenue. And suchpreferences might be equally fatal, if indirectlygiven under the milder form of requiring an entry,clearance, or payment of duties in the ports of anyAbr. 45354 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.State, Other than the ports of the state, to or fromwhich the vessel was bound. The last clause, therefore,does not prohibit congress from requiring an entryor clearance, or payment of duties at the custom-house,on importations in any port of a state, to or from whichthe vessel is bound ; but it cuts off the right to requiresuch acts to be done in other states, to which the vesselis not bound. In other words, it cuts off the powerto require that circuity of voyage, which, under theBritish colonial system, was employed to interruptthe American commerce before the revolution. NoAmerican vessel could then trade with Europe, unlessthrough a circuitous voyage to and from a British port.^ 497. The next clause contains a prohibition onthe states for the like objects and purposes. " Nostate shall, without the consent of congress lay anyimposts, or duties on imports or exports, exceptwhat may be absolutely necessary for executing itsinspection laws ; and the nett produce of all dutiesand imposts laid by any state on imports and exportsshall be for the use of the treasury of the UnitedStates ; and all such laws shall be subject to therevision and control of congress. No state shall,'' without the consent of congress, lay any tonnageduty." If there is wisdom and sound policy in restrainingthe United States from exercising the powerof taxation unequally in the states, there is, at least,equal wisdom and policy in restraining the states themselvesfrom the exercise of the same power injuriouslyto the interests of each other. A petty warfare ofregulation is thus prevented, which would rouse resentments,and create dissensions, to the ruin of theharmony and amity of the states. The power to enforcetheir inspection laws is still retained, subject toCH. XIV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS TAXES. 355the revision and control of congress ; so, that sufficientprovision is made for the convenient arrangement oftheir domestic and internal trade, whenever it is notinjurious to the general interests.§ 498. Inspection laws are not, strictly speaking,regulations of commerce, though they may have a remoteand considerable influence on commerce. Theobject of inspection laws is to improve the quality ofarticles produced by the labour of a country ; to fitthem for exportation, or for domestic use. Theselaws act upon the subject, before it becomes an articleof commerce, foreign or domestic, and prepare it forthe purpose. They form a portion of that immensemass of legislation, which embraces every thing inthe territory of a state not surrendered to the generalgovernment. Inspection laws, quarantine laws, andhealth laws, as well as laws for regulating the internalcommerce of a state, and others, which respect roads,fences, &c. are component parts of state legislation,resulting from the residuary powers of state sovereignty.No direct power over these is given to congress,and consequently they remain subject to statelegislation, though they may be controlled by congress,when they interfere with their acknowledged powers.The power to lay duties and imposts on imports andexports, and to lay a tonnage duty, are doubtless properlyconsidered a part of the taxing power ; but theymay also be applied, as a regulation of commerce.^ 499. Until a recent period, no difficulty occurredin regard to the prohibitions of this clause. Congress,with a just liberality, gave full effect to the inspectionlaws of the states, and required them to be observedby the revenue officers of the United States. In thewear 1821, the state of Maryland passed an act requireCONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.ing, that all importers of foreign articles or commodities,&c. by bale or package, or of wine, rum, &c. &c.,and other persons selling the same by wholesale, bale,or package, hogshead, barrel, or tierce, should, beforethey were authorized to sell, take out a license, forwhich they were to pay Fifty dollars, under certainpenalties. Upon this act a question arose, whether itwas, or not a violation of the constitution of the UnitedStates, and especially of the prohibitory clause nowunder consideration. Upon solemn argument, theSupreme Court decided, that it was.^ 500. As the power of taxation exists in the statesconcurrently with the United States, subject only tothe restrictions imposed by the constitution, severalquestions have from time to time arisen in regard tothe nature and extent of the state power of taxation.^ 501. In the year 1818, the state of Marylandpassed an act, laying a tax on all banks, and branchesthereof, not chartered by the legislature of that state ;and a question was made, whether the state had aright under that act to lay a tax on the Branch Bankof the United States in that state. This gave rise toa most animated discussion in the Supreme Court ofthe United States ; where it was finally decided, thatthe tax was, as to the Bank of the United States,unconstitutional .^ 502. In another case the question was raised,whether a state had a constitutional authority to taxstock issued for loans to the United States ; and itwas held by the Supreme Court, that a state had not.^ 503. It is observable, that these decisions turnupon the point, that no state can have authority to taxan instrument of the United States, or thereby to diminishthe means of the United States, used in theCH. XIV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS TAXES. 357exercise of powers confided to it. But there is noprohibition upon any state to tax any bank or othercorporation created by its own authority, unless it hasrestrained itself, by the charter of incorporation, fromthe power of taxation. It may be added, that congressmay, without doubt, tax state banks ; for it isclearly within the taxing power confided to the generalgovernment. When congress tax the charteredinstitutions of the states, they tax their own constituents; and such taxes must be uniform. But when astate taxes an institution created by congress, it taxesan instrument of a superior and independent sovereignty,not represented in the state legislature.358 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.CHAPTER XV.POWER TO BORROW MONEY AND REGULATE Commerce.^ 504. Having finished this examination of thepower of taxation, and of the accompanying restrictionsand prohibitions, the other powers of congresswill be now examined in the order, in which theystand m the eighth section.§ 505. The next, is the power of congress, '' toborrow money on the credit of the United States."This power seems indispensable to the sovereigntyand existence of a national government. Even underthe confederation this power was expressly delegated.The remark is unquestionably just, that it is a powerinseparably connected with that of raising a revenue,and with the duty of protection, which that power imposesupon the general government. Though in timesof profound peace it may not be ordinarily necessaryto anticipate the revenues of a state ; yet the experienceof all nations must convince us, that the burthenand expenses of one year in time of war may morethan equal the ordinary revenue of ten years. Hence,a debt is almost unavoidable, when a nation is plungedinto a state of war. The least burthensome mode ofcontracting a debt is by a loan. Indeed, this recoursebecomes the more necessary, because the ordinary dutiesupon importations are subject to great diminutionand fluctuations in times of war ; and a resort to directtaxes for the whole supply would, under such circumstances,become oppressive and ruinous to the agriculturalinterests of the country. Even in times of peaceCH. XV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS LOANS. 359exigencies may occur, which render a loan the mostfacile, economical, and ready means of supply, eitherto meet expenses, or to avert calamities, or to save thecountry from an undue depression of its staple productions.The government of the United States has, onseveral occasions in times of profound peace, obtainedlarge loans, among which a striking illustration of theeconomy and convenience of such arrangements willbe found in the creation of stock on the purchase ofLouisiana. The power to borrow money by theUnited States cannot (as has been already seen) inany way be controlled, or interfered with by the states.The grant of the power is incompatible with anyrestraining or controlling power ; and the declarationof supremacy in the constitution is a declaration thatno such restraining or controlling power shall be exercised.§ 506. The next power of congress is, " to regulatecommerce with foreign nations, and among the severalstates, and with the Indian tribes."^ 507. The want of this power (as has been alreadyseen) was one of the leading defects of the confederation,and probably, as much as any one cause, conducedto the establishment of the constitution. It is apower vital to the prosperity of the Union ; and withoutit the government would scarcely deserve the nameof a national government ; and would soon sink intodiscredit and imbecility. It would stand, as a mereshadow of sovereignty, to mock our hopes, and involveus in a common ruin.^ 508. The oppressed and degraded state of commerce,previous to the adoption of the constitution, canscarcely be forgotten. It was regulated by foreignnations with a single view to their own interests ; andCONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.our disunited efforts to counteract their restrictionswere rendered impotent by a want of combination.Congress, indeed, possessed the power of making treaties; but the inability of the federal government toenforce them had become so apparent, as to renderthat power in a great degree useless. Those, who feltthe injury arising from this state of things, and those,who were capable of estimating the influence of commerceon the prosperity of nations, perceived thenecessity of giving the control over this important subjectto a single government. It is not, therefore, matterof surprise, that the grant should be as extensive,as the mischief, and should comprehend all foreigncommerce, and all commerce among the states.§ 509. In considering this clause of the constitutionseveral important inquiries are presented. In thefirst place, what is the natural import of the terms ; inthe next place, how far the power is exclusive of thatof the states ; in the third place, to what purposes andfor what objects the power may be constitutionally applied; and in the fourth place, what are the true natureand extent of the power to regulate commerce with theIndian tribes.§ 510. In the first place, then, what is the constitutionalmeaning of the words, "to regulate commerce;"for the constitution being (as has been aptly said) oneof enumeration, and not of definition, it becomes necessary,in order to ascertain the extent of the power, toascertain the meaning of the words. The power is toregulate ; that is, to prescribe the rule, by which commerceis to be governed. ' The subject to be regulatedis commerce. Is that limited to traffic, to buying andselling, or the interchange of commodities ? Or doesit comprehend navigation and intercourse ? If the formerconstruction is adopted, then a general term applied.XV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS COMMERCE. 361cable to many objects is restricted to one of its significations.If the latter, then a general term is retainedin its general sense. To adopt the former, withoutsome guiding grounds furnished by the context, or thenature of the power, would be improper. The wordsbeing general, the sense must be general also, and embraceall subjects comprehended under them, unlessthere be some obvious mischief, or repugnance to otherclauses to limit them. In the present case there isnothing to justify such a limitation. Commerce undoubtedlyis traffic ; but it is something more. It isintercourse. It describes the commercial intercoursebetween nations, and parts of nations, in all its branches;and is regulated by prescribing rules for carrying onthat intercourse. The mind can scarcely conceive asystem for regulating commerce between nations, whichshall exclude all laws concerning navigation; whichshall be silent on the admission of the vessels of onenation into the ports of another; and be confined toprescribing rules for the conduct of individuals in theactual employment of buying and selling, or barter.§511. If commerce does not include navigation,the government of the Union has no direct power overthat subject, and can make no law prescribing, whatshall constitute American vessels, or requiring, thatthey shall be navigated by American seamen. Yetthis power has been exercised from the commencementof the government ; it has been exercised withthe consent of all America ; and it has been alwaysunderstood to be a commercial regulation. The powerover navigation, and over commercial intercourse, wasone of the primary objects, for which the people ofAmerica adopted their government ; and it is impossible,that the convention should not have understoodAbr. 46362 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.the word " commerce," as embracing it. Indeed, toconstrue the power, so as to impair its efficacy, woulddefeat the very object, for which it was introduced intothe constitution ; for there cannot be a doubt, that toexclude navigation and intercourse from its scopewould be to entail upon us all the prominent defects ofthe confederation, and subject the Union to the ill-adjustedsystems of rival states, and the oppressive preferencesof foreign nations in favour of their own navigation.§ 512. The very exceptions found in the constitutiondemonstrate this ; for it would be absurd, as wellas useless, to except from a granted power that, whichwas not granted, or that, which the words did not comprehend.There are plain exceptions in the constitutionfrom the power over navigation, and plain inhibitionsto the exercise of that power in a particular way.Why should these be made, if the power itself was notunderstood to be granted? The clause already cited,that no preference shall be given by any regulation ofcommerce or revenue to the ports of one state overthose of another, is of this nature. This clause cannotbe understood, as applicable to those laws only, whichare passed for purposes of revenue, because it is expresslyapplied to commercial regulations ; and the mostobvious preference, which can be given to one portover another, relates to navigation. But the remainingpart of the sentence directly points to navigation. " Norshall vessels, bound to or from one state, be obliged toenter, clear, or pay duties in another." In short, ourwhole system for the encouragement of navigation inthe coasting trade and fisheries is exclusively foundedupon this supposition. Yet no one has ever been boldenough to question the constitutionality of the laws,creating this system.CH. XV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS COMMERCE. 363§ 513. Foreign and domestic intercourse has beenuniversally understood to be within the reach of thepower. How, otherwise, could our systems of prohibitionand non-intercourse be defended? From whatother source has been derived the power of laying embargoesin a time of peace, and without any referenceto war, or its operations ? Yet this power has beenuniversally admitted to be constitutional, even in timesof the highest political excitement. And although thelaying of an embargo in the form of a perpetual law wascontested, as unconstitutional, at one period of our politicalhistory, it was so, not because an embargo wasnot a regulation of commerce, but because a perpetualembargo was an annihilation, and not a regulation, ofcommerce. It may, therefore, be safely affirmed, thatthe terms of the constitution have at all times been understoodto include a power over navigation, as well astrade, over intercourse, as well as traffic ; and, that, inthe practice of other countries, and especially in our own,there has been no diversity of judgment or opinion.During our whole colonial history, this was acted uponby the British parliament, as an uncontested doctrine.That government regulated not merely our traffic withforeign nations, but our navigation, and intercourse, asunquestioned functions of the power to regulate commerce.514 This power the constitution extends tocommerce with foreign nations, and among the severalstates, and with the Indian tribes. In regard to foreignnations, it is universally admitted, that the wordscomprehend every species of commercial intercourse.No sort of trade or intercourse can be carried on betweenthis country and another, to which it does notextend. Commerce, as used in the constitution, is a364 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.unit, every part of which is indicated by the term. Ifthis be its admitted meaning in its application to foreignnations, it must carry the same meaning throughout theSentence. The next words are "among the severalstates." The word "among" means intermingledwith. A thing, which is among others, is intermingledwith them. Commerce among the states cannot stopat the external boundary line of each state, but may beintroduced into the interior. It does not, indeed, comprehendany commerce, which is purely internal, betweenman and man in a single state, or between differentparts of the same state, and not extending to, oraffecting other states. Commerce among the statesmeans, commerce, which concerns more states than one.It is not an apt phrase to indicate the mere interiortraffic of a single state. The completely internal commerceof a state may be properly considered, as reservedto the state itself.§ 515. The importance of the power of regulatingcommerce among the states, for the purposes of theUnion, is scarcely less, than that of regulating it withforeign states. A very material object of this power isthe relief of the states, which import and export throughother states, from the levy of improper contributions onthem by the latter. If each state were at liberty toregulate the trade between state and state, it is easy toforesee, that ways would be found out to load the articlesof import and export, during their passage through thejurisdiction, with duties, which should fall on the makersof the latter, and the consumers of the former. Theexperience of the American states during the confederationabundantly establishes, that such arrangementscould be, and would be made under the stimulating influenceof local interests, and the desire of undue gain.CH. XV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS COMMERCE. 365Instead of acting as a nation in regard to foreign powers,the states individually commenced a system ofrestraint upon each other, whereby the interests of foreignpowers were promoted at their expense. Whenone state imposed high duties on the goods or vesselsof a foreign power to countervail the regulations ofsuch powers, the next adjoining states imposed lighterduties to invite those articles into their ports, that theymight be transferred thence into the other states, securingthe duties to themselves. This contracted policyin some of the states was soon counteracted by others.Restraints were immediately laid on such commerceby the suffering states ; and thus a state of affairs disorderlyand unnatural grew up, the necessary tendencyof which was to destroy the Union itself. The historyof other nations, also, furnishes the same admonition.In Switzerland, where the Union is very slight, it hasbeen found necessary to provide, that each canton shallbe obliged to allow a passage to merchandise throughits jurisdiction into other cantons without any augmentationof tolls. In Germany, it is a law of the empire,that the princes shall not lay tolls on customs or bridges,rivers, or passages, without the consent of the emperorand diet. But these regulations are but imperfectlyobeyed ; and great public mischiefs have consequentlyfollowed. Indeed, without this power to regulatecommerce among the states, the power of regulatingforeign commerce would be incomplete and ineffectual.The very laws of the Union in regard to the latter,whether for revenue, for restriction, for retaliation, orfor encouragement of domestic products or pursuits,might be evaded at pleasure, or rendered impotent.In short, in a practical view, it is impossible to separatethe regulation of foreign commerce and domestic com-constitutionOF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.mere among the states from each other. The samepublic policy applies to each ; and not a reason can beassigned for confiding the power over the one, whichdoes not conduce to establish the propriety of concedingthe power over the other.^516. The next inquiry is, whether this power toregulate commerce is exclusive of the same powerin the states, or is concurrent with it. It has beensettled upon the most solemn deliberation, that thepower is exclusive in the government of the UnitedStates. The reasoning, upon which this doctrine isfounded, is to the following effect. The power to regulatecommerce is general and unlimited in its terms.The full power to regulate a particular subject impliesthe whole power, and leaves no residuum, A grant ofthe whole is incompatible with the existence of a rightin another to any part of it. A grant of a power toregulate necessarily excludes the action of all others,who would perform the same operation on the samething. Regulation is designed to indicate the entireresult, applying to those parts, which remain as theywhere, as well as to those, which are altered. It producesa uniform whole, which is as much disturbed andderanged by changing, what the regulating power designsto have unbounded, as that, on which it hasoperated.§ 517. The power to regulate commerce is not atall like that to lay taxes. The latter may well be concurrent,while the former is exclusive, resulting fromthe different nature of the two powers. The power ofcongress in laying taxes is not necessarily, or naturallyinconsistent with that of the states. Each may lay a taxon the same property, without interfering with the actionof the other ; for taxation is but taking small portionsCH. XV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS COMMERCE. 367from the mass of property, which is susceptible of almostinfinite division. In imposing taxes for state purposes,a state is not doing, what congress is empowered to do.Congress is not empowered to tax for those purposes,which are within the exclusive province of the states.When, then, each government exercises the power oftaxation, neither is exercising the power of the other.But when a state proceeds to regulate commerce withforeign nations, or among the several states, it is exercisingthe very power, which is granted to congress ;and is doing the very thing, which congress is authorizedto do. There is no analogy, then, between thepower of taxation, and the power of regulating commerce.^518. Nor can any power be inferred in the statesto regulate commerce from other clauses in the constitution,or the acknowledged rights exercised by thestates. The constitution has prohibited the states fromlaying any impost or duty on imports or exports ; butthis does not admit, that the state might otherwise haveexercised the power, as a regulation of commerce. Thelaying of such imposts and duties may be, and indeedoften is used, as a mere regulation of commerce, bygovernments possessing that power. But the layingof such imposts and duties is as certainly, and moreusually, a right exercised as a part of the power to laytaxes ; and with this latter power the states are clearlyentrusted. So, that the prohibition is an exception fromthe acknowledged power of the state to lay taxes, andnot from the questionable power to regulate commerce.Indeed, the constitution treats these as distinct and independentpowers. The same remarks apply to a dutyon tonnage.^ 519. Nor do the acknowledged powers of the368 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.States over certain subjects, having a connexion v^^ithcommerce, in any degree impugn this reasoning. Thesepowers are entirely distinct in their nature from that toregulate commerce ; and though the same means mayberesorted to, for the purpose of carrying each of thesepowers into effect, this by no just reasoning furnishesany ground to assert, that they are identical. Amongthese, are inspection laws, health laws, laws regulatingturnpikes, roads, and ferries, all of which, when exercisedby a state, are legitimate, arising from thegeneral powers belonging to it, unless so far as theyconflict with the powers delegated to congress. Theyare not so much regulations of commerce, as of police ;and may truly be said to belong, if at all to commerce,to that which is purely internal. The pilotage laws ofthe states may fall under the same description. Butthey have been adopted by congress; and without questionare controllable by it.§ 520. The power in congress, then, being exclusive,no state is at liberty to pass any laws imposing atax upon importers, importing goods from foreign countries,or from other states. It is wholly immaterialwhether the tax be laid on the goods imported, or onthe person of the importer. In each case, it is a restrictionof the right of commerce, not conceded to the states.As the power of congress to regulate commerce reachesthe interior of a state, it might be capable of authorizingthe sale of the articles, which it introduces. Commerceis intercourse ; and one of its most ordinaryingredients is traffic. It is inconceivable, that thepower to authorize traffic, when given in the most comprehensiveterms, with the intent, that its efficacyshould be complete, should cease at the point, whenits continuance is indispensable to its value. To whatCH. XV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS COMMERCE. 369purpose should the power to allow importation be given,unaccompanied with the power to authorize the sale ofthe thing imported ? Sale is the object of importation;and it is an essential ingredient of that intercourse, ofwhich importation constitutes a part. As congress havethe right to authorize importation, they must have a rightto authorize the importer to sell. What would bethelanguage of a foreign government, which should beinformed, that its merchants after importation wereforbidden to sell the merchandize imported? Whatanswer could the United States give lo the complaintsand just reproaches, to which such extraordinary conductwould expose them ? No apology could be received,or offered. Such a state of things would annihilatecommerce. It is no answer, that the tax may bemoderate ; for, if the power exists in the states, it maybecarried to any extent they may choose. If it doesnot exist, every exercise of it is, pro tanto, a violation ofthe power of congress to regulate commerce.§ 521. In the next place, to what extent, and forwhat objects and purposes the power to regulate commercemay be constitutionally applied.^ 522. And first, among the states. It is not doubted,that it extends to the regulation of navigation, andto the coasting trade and fisheries, within, as well aswithout any state, wherever it is connected with thecommerce or intercourse with any other state, or withforeign nations. It extends to the regulation and governmentof seamen on board of American ships ; andto conferring privileges upon ships built and owned inthe United States in domestic, as well as in foreign trade.It extends to quarantine laws, and pilotage laws, andwrecks of the sea. It extends, to the navigation ofvessels engaged in carrying passengers, (whetherAbr. 47370 CONSTITUTION OF THE U, STATES. [bOOK III.steam vessels, or of any other description,) as well asto the navigation of vessels engaged in traffic and generalcoasting business. It extends to the laying ofembargoes, as vt^ell on domestic, as on foreign voyages.It extends to the construction of light-houses, the placingof buoys and beacons, the removal of obstructionsto navigation in creeks, rivers, sounds, and bays, andthe establishment of securities to navigation against theinroads of the ocean. It extends also to the designationof particular ports of entry and delivery for thepurposes of commerce. The power has been actuallyexerted for these purposes by the national governmentunder systems of laws, some of which are almost coevalwith the establishment of the constitution ; andthese laws have continued unquestioned unto our day,if not to the utmost range of their reach, at least to thatof their ordinary application.^ 523. Secondly. Many like applications of thepower may be traced in the regulations of the commerceof the United States with foreign nations. It hasalso been employed sometimes for the purpose ofrevenue ; sometimes for the purpose of prohibition ;sometimes for the purpose of retaliation and commercialreciprocity ; sometimes to lay embargoes ; sometimesto encourage domestic navigation, and the shippingand mercantile interest by bounties, by discriminatingduties, and by special preferences and privileges ;and sometimes to regulate intercourse with a view tomere political objects, such as to repel aggressions,increase the pressure of war, or vindicate the rights ofneutral sovereignty. In all these cases, the right andduty have been conceded to the national government bythe unequivocal voice of the people.CH. XV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS COMMERCE. 371§ 524. A question has been recently made, whethercongress have a constitutional authority to apply thepower to regulate commerce for the purpose of encouragingand protecting domestic manufactures. It is notdenied, that congress may, incidentally, in its arrangementsfor revenue, or to countervail foreign restrictions,encourage the growth of domestic manufactures. Butit is earnestly and strenuously insisted, that, under thecolour of regulating commerce, congress have no rightpermanently to prohibit any importations, or to taxthem unreasonably for the purpose of securing the homemarket to the domestic manufacturer, as they therebydestroy the commerce entrusted to them to regulate, andfoster an interest, with which they have no constitutionalpower to interfere. This opinion constitutes the leadingdoctrine of several states in the Union at the presentmoment ; and is asserted by them to be vital tothe existence of the Union.§ 525. The reasoning, by which the doctrine ismaintained, that the power to regulate commerce cannotbe constitutionally applied, as a means, directly toencourage domestic manufactures, has been alreadyin part adverted to in considering the extent of thepower to lay taxes. It is proper, however, to presentit entire in its present connexion. It is to the followingeffect. — The constitution is one of limited and enumeratedpowers ; and none of them can be rightfullyexercised beyond the scope of the objects, specified inthose powers. It is not disputed, that, when the poweris given, all the appropriate means to carry it into effectare included. Neither is it disputed, that the laying ofduties is, or may be an appropriate means of regulatingcommerce. But the question is a very different one,whether, under pretence of an exercise of the power to372 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.regulate commerce, congress may in fact impose dutiesfor objects wholly distinct from commerce. The questioncomes to this, whether a power, exclusively for theregulation of commerce, is a power for the regulationof manufactures? The statement of such a questionwould seem to involve its own answer. Can apower, granted for one purpose, be transferred to another?If it can, where is the limitation in the constitution? Are not commerce and manufactures as distinct,as commerce and agriculture? If they are, how can apower to regulate one arise from a power to regulatethe other? It is true, that commerce and manufacturesare, or may be, intimately connected with each other.A regulation of one may injuriously or beneficially affectthe other. But this is not the point in controversy.It is, whether congress have a right to regulate that,which is not committed to them, under a power, which iscommitted io them, simply because there is, or maybe anintimate connexion between the powers. If this wereadmitted, the enumeration of the powers of congresswould be wholly unnecessary and nugatory. Agriculture,colonies, capital, machinery, the wages of labour,the profits of stock, the rents of land, the punctual performanceof contracts, and the diffusion of knowledgewould all be within the scope of the power ; for all ofthem bear an intimate relation to commerce. Theresult would be, that the powers of congress wouldembrace the widest extent of legislative functions, tothe utter demolition of all constitutional boundaries betweenthe state and national governments. Whenduties are laid, not for purposes ©f revenue, but of re-taxationand restriction, to countervail foreign restrictions,they are strictly within the scope of the power,as a regulation of commerce. But when laid to .XV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS COMMERCE. 373courage manufactures, they have nothing to do with it.The power to regulate manufactures is no more confidedto congress, than the power to interfere with thesystems of education, the poor laws, or the road lawsof the states. It is notorious, that, in the convention,an attempt was made to introduce into the constitutiona power to encourage manufactures ; but it was withheld.Instead of granting the power to congress, permissionwas given to the states to impose duties, withthe consent of that body, to encourage their own manufactures;thus, in the true spirit of justice, imposingthe burthen on those, who were to be benefited.It is true, that congress may, incidentally, w^hen layingduties for revenue, consult the other interests of thecountry. They may so arrange the details, as indirectlyto aid manufactures. And this is the whole extent,to which congress have ever gone until the tariffs, whichhave given rise to the present controversy. The formerprecedents of congress are not, even if admitted to beauthoritative, applicable to the question now presented.§ 526. The reasoning of those, who maintain thedoctrine, that congress has authority to apply the powerto regulate commerce to the purpose of protecting andencouraging domestic manufactures, is to the followingeffect. The power to regulate commerce, being in itsterms unlimited, includes all means appropriate to theend, and all means, which have been usually exertedunder the power. No one can doubt or deny, that apower to regulate trade involves a power to tax it. Itis a familiar mode, recognised in the practice of allnations, and was known and admitted by the UnitedStates, while they were colonies, and has ever sincebeen acted upon without opposition or question. TheAmerican colonies wholly denied the authority of the374 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.British parliament to tax them, except as a regulationof commerce ; but they admitted this exercise of power,as legitimate and unquestionable. The distinction waswith difficulty maintained in practice between laws forthe regulation of commerce by way of taxation, andlaws, which were made for mere monopoly, or restriction,when they incidentally produced revenue. Andit is certain, that the main and admitted object of part.nectary regulations of trade with the colonies wasthe encouragement of manufactures in Great-britain.Other nations have, in like manner, for like purposesexercised the like power. So, that there is no noveltyin the use of the power, and no stretch in the range ofthe power.§ 527. Indeed, the advocates of the opposite doctrineadmit, that the power may be applied, so as incidentallyto give protection to manufactures, when revenueis the principal design ; and that it may also beapplied to countervail the injurious regulations of foreignpowers, when there is no design of revenue. Theseconcessions admit, then, that the regulations of commerceare not wholly for purposes of revenue, or whollyconfined to the purposes of commerce, considered perse.If this be true, then other objects may enter intocommercial regulations ; and if so, what restraint isthere, as to the nature or extent of the objects, to whichthey may reach, which does not resolve itself into aquestion of expediency and policy? It may be admitted,that a power, given for one purpose, cannot beperverted to purposes wholly opposite, or beside itslegitimate scope. But what perversion is there in applyinga power to the very purposes, to which it hasbeen usually applied 7 Under such circumstances, doesnot the grant of the power without restriction concede,CH. XV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS COMMERCE. 375that it may be legitimately applied to such purposes 1If a different intent had existed, would not that intentbe manifested by some corresponding limitation ?^ 528. The terms, then, of the constitution are sufficientlylarge to embrace the power ; the practice ofother nations, and especially of Great-britain and of theAmerican states, has been to use it in this manner ;and this exercise of it was one of the very grounds,upon which the establishment of the constitution wasurged and vindicated. The argument, then, in itsfavour would seem to be absolutely irresistible underthis aspect. But there are other very weighty considerations,which enforce it.§ 529. In the first place, if congress does not possessthe power to encourage domestic manufactures byregulations of commerce, the power is annihilated forthe whole nation. The states are deprived of it. Theyhave made a voluntary surrender of it ; and yet it existsnot in the national government. It is then a merenonentity. Such a policy, voluntarily adopted by afree people, in subversion of some of their dearest rights,and interests, would be most extraordinary in itself,without any assignable motive or reason for so great asacrifice, and utterly without example in the history ofthe world. No man can doubt, that domestic agricultureand manufactures may be most essentially promotedand protected by regulations of commerce. Noman can doubt, that it is the most usual, and generallythe most efficient means of producing those results.No man can question, that in these great objects thedifferent states of America have as deep a stake, and asvital interests, as any other nation. Why, then, shouldthe power be surrendered and annihilated 1 It wouldproduce the most serious mischiefs at home ; and would376 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.secure the most complete triumph over us by foreignnations. It would introduce and perpetuate nationaldebility, if not national ruin. A foreign nation might, asaconqueror, impose upon us this restraint, as a badgeof dependence, and a sacrifice of sovereignty, to subserveits own interests ; but that we should impose itupon ourselves, is inconceivable. The achievement ofour independence was almost worthless, if such a systemwas to be pursued. It would be in effect a perpetuationof that very system of monopoly, of encouragementof foreign manufactures, and depression ofdomestic industry, which was so much complained ofduring our colonial dependence ; and which kept allAmerica in a state of poverty, and slavish devotion toBritish interests. Under such circumstances, the constitutionwould be established, not for the purposesavowed in the preamble, but for the exclusive benefitand advancement of foreign nations, to aid their manufactures,and sustain their agriculture. Suppose cotton,rice, tobacco, wheat, corn, sugar, and other raw materialscould be, or should hereafter be, abundantly producedin foreign countries, under the fostering hands of theirgovernments, by bounties and commercial regulations,so as to become cheaper with such aids than our own ;are all our markets to be opened to such products withoutany restraint, simply because wee may not wantrevenue, to the ruin of our products and industry ? IsAmerica ready to give every thing to Europe, withoutany equivalent ; and take in return whatever Europemay choose to give, upon its own terms 7 The mostservile provincial dependence could not do more evils.Of what consequence would it be, that the nationalgovernment could not tax our exports, if foreign governmentsmight tax them to an unlimited extent, so asCH. XV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS COMMERCE. 377to favour their own, and thus to supply us with thesame articles by the overwhelming depression of ourown by foreign taxation 1 When it is recollected, withwhat extreme discontent and reluctant obedience theBritish colonial restrictions were enforced in the manufacturingand navigating states, while they were colonies,it is incredible, that they should be willing to adoptagovernment, which should, or might entail upon themequal evils in perpetuity. Commerce itself would ultimatelybe as great a sufferer by such a system, as theother domestic interests. It would languish, if it didnot perish. Let any man ask himself, if New-england,or the Middle states, would ever have consented to ratifya constitution, which would afford no protection totheir manufactures or home industry. If the constitutionwas ratified under the beef, sedulously propagatedon all sides, that such protection was afforded, would itnot now be a fraud upon the whole people to give adifferent construction to its powers ?^ 530. Passing by these considerations, let thepractice of the government and the doctrines maintainedby those, who have administered it, be deliberatelyexamined ; and they \n\\ be found to be in entire consistencywith this reasoning. The very first congress,that ever sat under the constitution, composed in a considerabledegree of those, who had framed, or assistedin the discussion of its provisions in the state conventions,deliberately adopted this view of the power.And what is most remarkable, upon a subject of dee])interest and excitement, which at the time occasionedlong and vehement debates, not a single syllable ofdoubt was breathed from any quarter against the constitutionalityof protecting agriculture and manufacturesby laying duties, although the intention to protect, andAbr. 48378 CONSTITUTION OF THE U, STATES. [bOOK III.encourage them was constantly avowed. Nay, it wascontended to be a paramount duty, upon the faithfulfulfilment of which the constitution had been adopted,and the omission of which would be a political fraud,without a whisper of dissent from any side. It wasdemanded by the people from various parts of theUnion ; and was resisted by none. Yet, state jealousywas never more alive than at this period, and state interestsnever more actively mingled in the debates ofcongress. The two great parties, which afterwards somuch divided the country upon the question of a liberaland strict construction of the constitution, were thendistinctly formed, and proclaimed their opinions withfirmness and freedom. If, therefore, there had been apoint of doubt, on which to hang an argument, it cannotbe questioned, but that it would have been broughtinto the array of opposition. Such a silence, undersuch circumstances, is most persuasive and convincing.§ 531. If ever, therefore, contemporaneous exposition,and the uniform and progressive operations ofthe government itself in all its departments, can be ofany weight to setde the construction of the constitution,there never has been, and there never can be moredecided evidence in favour of the power, than is furnishedby the history of our national laws for the encouragementof domestic agriculture and manufactures.To resign an exposition so sanctioned, would be to deliverover the country to interminable doubts ; and tomake the constitution, not a written system of government,but a false and delusive text, upon which everysuccessive age of speculations and statesmen mightbuild any system, suited to their own views and opinions.But if it be added to this, that the constitutionCH. XV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS — COMMERCE. 379gives the power in the most unlimited terms, andneither assigns motives, nor objects for its exercise ;but leaves these wholly to the discretion of the legislature,acting for the common good, and the general interests; the argument in its favour becomes as absolutelyirresistible, as any demonstration of a moral orpoUtical nature ever can be. Without such a power,the government would be absolutely worthless, andmade merely subservient to the policy of foreign nations,incapable of self-protection or self-support ; with it,the country will have a right to assert its equality, anddignity, and sovereignty among the other nations of theearth.^ 532. The power of congress also extends to regulatecommerce with the Indian tribes. This power wasnot contained in the first draft of the constitution. Itwas afterwards referred to the committee on the constitution(among other propositions) to consider the proprietyof giving to congress the power " to regulateaffairs with the Indians, as well within, as without thelimits of the United States." And, in the revised draft,the committee reported the clause, " and with the IndianTribes," as it now stands.^ 533. Antecedently to the American Revolutionthe authority to regulate trade and intercourse with theIndian tribes, whether they were within, or withoutthe boundaries of the colonies, was understood to belongto the prerogative of the British crown. Andafter the American Revolution, the like power wouldnaturally fall to the federal government, with a viewto the general peace and interest of all the states.Two restrictions, however, upon the power wereincorporated with it into the confederation, whichoccasioned endless embarrassments and doubts. The380 Constitution OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.power of congress was restrained to Indians, not membersof any of the states ; and was not to be exercised,so as to violate or infringe the legislative right of anystate within its own limits. What descriptions of Indianswere to be deemed members of a state was neverseeded under the confederation; and the question wasone of frequent perplexity and contention in the federalcouncils. And how the trade with Indians, though notmembers of a state, yet residing within its legislativejurisdiction, was to be regulated by an external authority,without so far intruding on the internal rights of legislation,was absolutely incomprehensible. In this case,as in some other cases, the articles of confederation inconsideratelyendeavoured to accomplish impossibilities; to reconcile a partial sovereignty in the Union,with complete sovereignty in the states ; to subvert amathematical axiom, by taking away a part, and lettingthe whole remain. The constitution has wisely disembarrassedthe power of these two limitations ; and hasthus given to congress, as the only safe and proper depositary,the exclusive power, which belonged to thecrown in the ante-revolutionary times ; a power indispensableto the peace of the states, and to the just preservationof the rights and territory of the Indians. Inthe former illustrations of this subject, it was stated,that the Indians, from the first setdement of the country,were always treated, as distinct, though in somesort, as dependent nations. Their territorial rights andsovereignty were respected. They were deemed incapableof carrying on trade or intercourse with anyforeign nations, or of ceding their territories to them.But their right of self-government was admitted ; andthey were allowed a national existence, under the protectionof the parent country, which exempted themCH. XV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS Commerce. 381from the ordinary operations of the legislative power ofthe colonies. During the revolution and afterwardsthey were secured in the like enjoyment of their rightsand property, as separate communities. The governmentof the United States, since the constitution, hasalways recognised the same attributes of dependentsovereignty, as belonging to them, and claimed thesame right of exclusive regulation of trade and intercoursewith them, and the same authority to protectand guarantee their territorial possessions, immunities,and jurisdiction.§ 634. The power, then, given to congress to regulatecommerce with the Indian tribes, extends equallyto tribes having within or without the boundaries of particularstates, and within or without the territorial limitsof the United States. It is (says a learned commentator)wholly immaterial, whether such tribes continueseated within the boundaries of a state, inhabit part ofa territory, or roam at large over lands, to which theUnited States have no claim. The trade with them is,in all its forms, subject exclusively to the regulation ofcongress. And in this particular, also, we trace thewisdom of the constitution. The Indians, not distractedby the discordant regulations of different states, aretaught to trust one great body, whose justice they respect,and whose power they fear.^ 535. It has lately been made a question, whetheran Indian tribe, situated within the territorial boundariesof a state, but exercising the powers of government,and national sovereignty, under the guarantee of thegeneral government, is a foreign state in the sense ofthe constitution, and as such entitled to sue in thecourts of the United States. Upon solemn argument,it has been held, that such a tribe is to be deemed posseCONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.literally a state ; that is, a distinct political society, capableof self-government ; but it is not to be deemed aforeign state, in the sense of the constitution. It israther a domestic dependent nation. Such a tribe mayproperly be deemed to be in a state of pupilage ; andits relation to the United States resembles that of award to a guardian.CH. XVI.] POWERS OF Congo-NATURALIZATION. 383CHAPTER XVI.POWER OVER NATURALIZATION AND BANKRUPTCY.^ 536. The next clause is, that congress " shall have"power to establish an uniform rule of naturalization,*sand uniform laws on the subject of bankruptciesthroughout the United States."^ 537. The propriety of confiding the power toestablish an uniform rule of naturalization to the nationalgovernment seems not to have occasioned any doubtor controversy in the convention. For aught that appearson the journals, it was conceded without objection.Under the confederation, the states possessedthe sole authority to exercise the power ; and the dissimilarityof the system in different states was generallyadmitted, as a prominent defect, and laid the foundationof many delicate and intricate questions. As thefree inhabitants of each state were entitled to all theprivileges and immunities of citizens in all the otherstates, it followed, that a single state possessed thepower of forcing upon other states, with the enjoymentof every immunity and privilege, any alien, whomit might choose to incorporate into its own society,however repugnant such admission might be to theirpolity, convenience, and even prejudices. In effectevery state possessed the power of naturalizing aliensin every other state ; a power as mischievous in its nature,as it was indiscreet in its actual exercise. In somestates, residence for a short time might, and did conferthe rights of citizenship. In others, qualificationsof greater importance were required. An alien,384 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.therefore, incapacitated for the possession of certainrights by the laws of the latter, might, by a previousresidence and naturalization in the former, elude atpleasure all their salutary regulations for self-protection.Thus, the laws of a single state were preposterouslyrendered paramount to the laws of all the others, evenwithin their own jurisdiction. And it has been remarkedwith equal truth and justice, that it was owing tomere casualty, that the exercise of this power duringthe confederation did not involve the Union in themost serious embarrassments. There is great wisdom,therefore, in confiding to the national government thepower to establish a uniform rule of naturalizationthroughout the United States. It is of the deepest interestto the whole Union to know, who are entided toenjoy the rights of citizens in each state, since theythereby, in effect, become entided to the rights of citizensin all the states. If aliens might be admitted indiscriminatelyto enjoy all the rights of citizens at thewill of a single state, the Union might itself be endangeredby an influx of foreigners, hostile to its institutions,ignorant of its powers, and incapable of a dueestimate of its privileges.§ 538. It follows, from the very nature of the power,that to be useful, it must be exclusive ; for a concurrentpower in the states would bring back all theevils and embarrassments, which the uniform rule ofthe constitution was designed to remedy. And accordingly,though there was a momentary hesitation,when the constitution first went into operation, whetherthe power might not still be exercised by the states,subject only to the control of congress, so far as thelegislation of the latter extended, as the supreme law ;yet the power is now firmly established to be exclusivein congress.CH. XVI.] POWERS OF CONGRESS-BANKRUPTCY. 385^ 539. Before the adoption of the constitution thestates severally possessed the exclusive right, as matterbelonging to their general sovereignty, to p?.ss lawsupon the subject of bankruptcy and insolvency. Withoutstopping at present to consider, what is the precisemeaning of each of these terms, as contradistinguishedfrom the other ; it may be stated, that the general objectof all bankrupt and insolvent laws is, on the onehand, to secure to creditors an appropriation of theproperty of their debtors, pro tanto, to the discharge oftheir debts, whenever the latter are unable to dischargethe whole amount ; and, on the other hand, to relieveunfortunate and honest debtors from perpetual bondage 'to their creditors, either in the shape of unlimited imprisonmentto coerce payment of their debts, or of anabsolute right to appropriate and monopolize all theirfuture earnings. The latter course obviously destroysall encouragement to industry and enterprize on thepart of the unfortunate debtor, by taking from him allthe just rewards of his labour, and leaving him a miserablepittance, dependent upon the bounty or forbearanceof his creditors. The former is, if possible, moreharsh, severe, and indefensible. It makes poverty andmisfortune, in themselves sufficiently heavy burthens,the subject or the occasion of penalties and punishments.Imprisonment, as a civil remedy, admits of nodefence, except so far as it is used to coerce fraudulentdebtors to yield up their present property to their creditors,in discharge of their engagements. But when thedebtors have no property, or have yielded up the wholeto their creditors, to allow the latter at their mere pleasureto imprison them, is a refinement in cruelty, and anindulgence of private passions, which could hardly findapology in an enlightened despotism ; and is utterlyAbr. 49386 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.at war with all the rights and duties of free governments.Such a system of legislation is as unjust, as itis unfeeling. It is incompatible with the first preceptsof Christianity ; and is a living reproach to the nationsof Christendom, carrying them back to the worst agesof paganism. One of the first duties of legislation, whileit provides amply for the sacred obligation of contracts,and the remedies to enforce them, certainly is, paripassu, to relieve the unfortunate and meritorious debtorfrom a slavery of mind and body, which cuts him offfrom a fair enjoyment of the common benefits of society,and robs his family of the fruits of his labour, and thebenefits of his paternal superintendence. A nationalgovernment, which did not possess this power of legislation,would be hide worthy of the exalted functions ofguarding the happiness, and supporting the rights of afree people. It might guard them against political oppressions,only to render private oppressions more intolerable,and more glaring.^ 540. But there are peculiar reasons, independentof these general considerations, why the governmentof the United States should be entrusted with thispower. They result from the importance of preservingharmony, promoting justice, and securing equalityof rights and remedies among the citizens of all thestates. It is obvious, that if the power is exclusivelyvested in the states, each one will be at liberty to framesuch a system of legislation upon the subject of bankruptcyand insolvency, as best suits its own local interests,and pursuits. Under such circumstances no uniformityof system or operations can be expected. Onestate may adopt a system of general insolvency ; another,a limited or temporary system ; one may relievefrom the obligation of contracts; another only fromCH. XVI.] POWERS OF CONGRESS-BANKRUPTCY. 387imprisonment; one may adopt a still more restrictivecourse of occasional relief; and another may refuseto act in any manner upon the subject. Thelaws of one state may give undue preferences to oneclass of creditors, as for instance, to creditors by bond,or judgment ; another may provide for an equality ofdebts, and a distribution pro rata without distinctionamong all. One may prefer creditors living within thestate to all living without ; securing to the former anentire priority of payment out of the assets. Anothermay, with a more liberal justice, provide for the equalpayment of all, at home and abroad, without favour orpreference. In short, diversities of almost infinitevariety and objects may be introduced into the local system,which may work gross injustice and inequality,and nourish feuds and discontents in neighbouringstates. What is here stated, is not purely speculative.It has occurred among the American states in the mostoffensive forms, without any apparent reluctance orcompunction on the part of the offending state. Therewall always be found in every state a large mass of politicians,who will deem it more safe to consult their owntemporary interests and popularity, by a narrow systemof preferences, than to enlarge the boundaries, so as togive to distant creditors a fair share of the fortune of aruined debtor. There can be no other adequate remedy,than giving a power to the general government, tointroduce and perpetuate a uniform system.§ 541. In the next place it is clear, that no statecan introduce any system, which shall extend beyondits own territorial limits, and the persons, who are subjectto its jurisdiction. Creditors residing in otherstates cannot be bound by its laws ; and debts contractedin other states are beyond the reach of its388 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.legislation. It can neither discharge the obligation ofsuch contracts, nor touch the remedies, which relate tothem in any other jurisdiction. So that the most meritoriousinsolvent debtor will be harassed by new suits,and new litigations, as often as he moves out of thestate boundaries. His whole property may be absorbedby his creditors residing in a single state, and hemay be left to the severe retribution of judicial processin every other state in the Union. Among a people,whose general and commercial intercourse must be sogreat, and so constantly increasing, as in the UnitedStates, this alone would be a most enormous evil,and bear with peculiar severity upon all the commercialstates. Very few persons engaged in active businesswill be without debtors or creditors in many statesin the Union. The evil is incapable of being redressedby the states. It can be adequately redressed onlyby the power of the Union. One of the most pressinggrievances, bearing upon commercial, manufacturing,and agricultural interests at the present moment, is thetotal want of a general system of bankruptcy. It iswell known, that the power has lain dormant, exceptfor a short period, ever since the constitution wasadopted ; and the excellent system, then put into operation,was repealed, before it had any fair trial, upongrounds generally believed to be wholly beside its merits,and from causes more easily understood, than deliberatelyvindicated.^ 542. In the next place, the power is important inregard to foreign countries, and to our commercialcredit and intercourse with them. Unless the generalgovernment were invested with authority to passsuitable laws, which should give reciprocity and equalityin cases of bankruptcies here, there would be danger,CH. XVI.] POWERS OF CONGRESS-BANKRUPTCY. 389that the state legislation might, by undue domesticpreferences and favours, compel foreign countries toretaliate ; and instead of allowing creditors in the UnitedStates to partake an equality of benefits in cases ofbankruptcies, to postpone them to all others. Theexistence of the power is, therefore, eminently useful ;first, as a check upon undue state legislation ; and secondly,as a means of redressing any grievances sustainedby foreigners in commercial transactions.^ 543. What laws are to be deemed bankrupt lawswithin the meaning of the constitution has been a matterof much forensic discussion and argument. Attemptshave been made to distinguish between bankruptlaws and insolvent laws. For example, it hasbeen said, that laws, which merely liberate the personof the debtor, are insolvent laws, and those, which dischargethe contract, are bankrupt laws. But it wouldbe very difficult to sustain this distinction by any uniformityof laws at home or abroad. In some of thestates, laws, known as insolvent laws, discharge theperson only ; in others, they discharge the contract.And if congress were to pass a bankrupt act, whichshould discharge the person only of the bankrupt, andleave his future acquisitions liable to his creditors, therewould be great difficulty in saying, that such an act wasnot in the sense of the constitution a bankrupt act, andso within the power of congress. Again ; it has beensaid, that insolvent laws act on imprisoned debtors onlyat their own instance ; and bankrupt laws only at theinstance of creditors. But, however true this may havebeen in past times, as the actual course of Englishlegislation, it is not true, and never was true, as a distinctionin colonial legislation. In England it was anaccident in tho system, and not a material ground to390 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.discriminate, who were to be deemed, in a legal sense,insolvent, or bankrupts. And if an act of congressshould be passed, which should authorize a commissionof bankruptcy to issue at the instance of the debtor,no court would on this account be warranted in saying,that the act was unconstitutional, and the commission anullity. It is believed, that no laws ever were passedin America by the colonies or states, which had thetechnical denomination of " bankrupt laws." But insolventlaws, quite co-extensive with the English bankruptsystem in their operations and objects, have not beenunfrequent in colonial and state legislation. No distinctionwas ever practically, or even theoretically, attemptedto be made between bankruptcies and insolvencies.And an historical review of the colonial andstate legislation will abundantly show, that a bankruptlaw may contain those regulations, which are generallyfound in insolvent laves ; and that an insolvent law maycontain those, which are common to bankrupt laws.^ 544. How far the power of congress to pass uniformlaws on the subject of bankruptcies supersedesthe authority of state legislation on the same subject,has been a matter of much elaborate forensic discussion.It has been strenuously maintained by somelearned minds, that the power in congress is exclusive ofthat of the states ; and whether exerted or not, it supersedesstate legislation. On the other hand, it has beenmaintained, that the power in congress is not exclusive ;that when congress has acted upon the subject, to theextent of the national legislation the power of the statesis controlled and limited ; but when unexpected, thestates are at liberty to exercise the power in its full extent,unless so far as they are controlled by other constitutionalprovisions. And this latter opinion is nowCH. XVI.] POWERS OF CONGRESS-bankruptcy. 891firmly established by judicial decisions. As this doctrineseems now to have obtained a general acquiescence,it is not necessary to review the reasoning,on which the different opinions are founded ; although,as a new question, it is probably as much opento controversy, as any one, which has ever given riseto judicial argumentation. But upon all such subjectsit seems desirable to adopt the sound practical maxim,Interest republic, ut finis sit latium,§ 545. It is, however, to be understood, that althoughthe states still retain the power to pass insolvent andbankrupt laws, that power is not unlimited, as it wasbefore the constitution. It does not, as will be presentlyseen, extend to the passing of insolvent or bankruptacts, which shall discharge the obligation of antecedentcontracts. It can discharge such contracts only,as are made subsequently to the passing of such acts,and such, as are made within the state between citizensof the same state. It does not extend to contractsmade with a citizen of another state within the state,nor to any contracts made in other states.392 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.CHAPTER XVII.POWER TO COIN MONEY AND FIX THE STANDARD OFWEIGHTS AND MEASURES.§546. The next power of congress is "to coinmoney, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin,and fix the standard of weights and measures."^ 547. Under the confederation, the continentalcongress had delegated to them, " the sole and exclusiveright and power of regulating the alloy and valueof coin struck by their own authority, or by that of thestates," and of "fixing the standard of weights and measuresthroughout the United States." It is observable,that, under the confederation, there was no power givento regulate the value of foreign coin, an omission, whichin a great measure would destroy any uniformity in thevalue of the current coin, since the respective statesmight by different regulations, create a different valuein each. The constitution has, with great propriety,cured this defect ; and, indeed, the whole clause, as itnow stands, does not seem to have attracted any discussionin the convention. It has been justly remarked,that the power " to coin money " would, doubtless,include that of regulating its value, had the latter powernot been expressly inserted. But the constitutionabounds with pleonasms and repetitions of this nature.§ 548. The grounds, upon which the general powerto coin money, and regulate the value of foreign anddomestic coin, is granted to the national government,cannot require much illustration in order to vindicate it.The object of the power is to produce uniformity ofCH. XVII.] POWER OF CONGRESS COINAGE. 393value throughout the Union, and thus to preclude usfrom the embarrassments of a perpetually fluctuatingand variable currency. Money is the universal mediumor common standard, by a comparison with which thevalue of all merchandise may be ascertained, or, it is asign, which represents the respective values of all commodities.It is, therefore, indispensable for the wantsand conveniences of commerce, domestic as well asforeign. The power to coin money is one of the ordinaryprerogatives of sovereignty, and is almost universallyexercised in order to preserve a proper circulationof good coin of a known value in the home market. Inorder to secure it from debasement it is necessary, thatit should be exclusively under the control and regulationof the government ; for if every individual were permittedto make and circulate, what coin he should please,there would be an opening to the grossest frauds andimpositions upon the public, by the use of base andfalse coin. And the same remark applies with equalforce to foreign coin, if allowed to circulate freely in acountry without any control by the government. Everycivilized government, therefore, with a view to preventsuch abuses, to facilitate exchanges, and thereby to encourageall sorts of industry and commerce, as well asto guard itself against the embarrassments of an unduescarcity of currency, injurious to its own interests andcredits, has found it necessary to coin money, and affixto it a public stamp and value, and to regulate the introductionand use of foreign coins. In England, thisprerogative belongs to the crown ; and, in former ages,it was greatly abused ; for base coin was often coinedand circulated by its authority, at a value far above itsintrinsic worth ; and thus taxes of a burthensome .50394 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK* III.ture were indirectly laid upon the people. There isgreat propriety, therefore, in confiding it to the legislature,not only as the more immediate representatives ofthe public interests, but as the more safe depositariesof the power.§ 549. The other power, "to fix the standard of"weights and measures," is, doubtless, given fromlike motives of public policy, for the sake of uniformity,and the convenience of commerce. Hitherto, however,it has remained a dormant power, from the manydifficulties attendant upon the subject, although it hasbeen repeatedly brought to the attention of congress inmostelaborate reports. Until congress shall fix astandard, the understanding seems to be, that thestates possess the power to fix their own weights andmeasures ; or, at least, the existing standards at theadoption of the constitution remain in full force. Underthe confederation, congress possessed the likeexclusive power. In England the power to regulateweights and measures is said by Mr. Justice Blackstoneto belong to the royal prerogative. But it hasbeen remarked by a learned commentator on his work,that the power cannot, with propriety, be referred tothe king's prerogative ; for, from Magna Charta to thepresent time, there are above twenty acts of parliamentto fix and establish the standard and uniformity ofweights and measures.§ 550. The next power of congress is, " to providefor the punishment of counterfeiting the securities and"current coin of the United States." This powerwould naturally flow, as an incident, from the antecedentpowers to borrow money, and regulate the coinage;and, indeed, without it the latter would be deficient inCH. XVII.] POWERS OF CONGRESS-WEIGHTS, &,C. 396any adequate sanction. This power would seem to beexclusive in congress, since it grows out of the constitution,as an appropriate means to carry into effectother delegated powers, not antecedently existing inthe states.396 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.CHAPTER XVIII.POWER TO ESTABLISH Post-offices AND POST-roads.^651. The next power of congress is, "to establishpost-offices and post-roads." The nature andextent of this power, both theoretically and practically,are of great importance, and have given rise to muchardent controversy. It deserves, therefore, a deliberateexamination. It was passed over by the Federalistwith a single remark, as a power not likely to be disputedin its exercise, or to be deemed dangerous by itsscope. The "power," says the Federalist, "of establishingpost-roads must, in every view, be a harmlesspower ; and may, perhaps, by judicious management,become productive of great public conveniency. Nothing,which tends to facilitate the intercourse betweenthe states, can be deemed unworthy of the public care."One cannot but feel, at the present time, an inclinationto smile at the guarded caution of these expressions,and the hesitating avowal of the importance of thepower. It affords, perhaps, one of the most strikingproofs, how much the growth and prosperity of thecountry have outstripped the most sanguine anticipationsof our most enlightened patriots.^ 552. The post-office establishment has alreadybecome one of the most beneficent, and useful establishmentsunder the national government. It circulatesintelligence of a commercial, political, intellectual, andprivate nature, with incredible speed and regularity. Itthus administers, in a very high degree, to the comfort.CH. XVIII.] POWERS OF CONGRESS-postoffice. 397the interests, and the necessities of persons, in everyrank and station of life. It brings the most distantplaces and persons, as it were, in contact with eachother ; and thus softens the anxieties, increases the enjoyments,and cheers the solitude of millions of hearts.It imparts a new influence and impulse to privateintercourse ; and, by a wider diffusion of knowledge,enables political rights and duties to be performed withmore uniformity and sound judgment. It is not lesseffective, as an instrument of the government in its ownoperations. In peace, it enables it without ostentationor expense to send its orders, and direct its measuresfor the public good, and transfer its funds, and apply itspowers, with a facility and promptitude, which, comparedwith the tardy operations, and imbecile expedients offormer times, seem like the wonders of magic. Inwar it is, if possible, still more important and useful,communicating intelligence vital to the movements ofarmies and navies, and the operations and dutiesof warfare, with a rapidity, which, if it does not alwaysensure victory, at least, in many instances, guardsagainst defeat and ruin. Thus, its influences have become,in a public, as well as private view, of incalculablevalue to the permanent interests of the Union. Itis obvious at a moment's glance at the subject, that theestablishment in the hands of the states would havebeen wholly inadequate to these objects ; and the impracticabilityof any uniformity of system would haveintroduced infinite delays and inconveniences ; andburthened the mails with an endless variety of vexatioustaxations, and regulations. No one, accustomedto the retardation of the post in passing through independentstates on the continent of Europe, can fail toappreciate the benefits of a power, which pervades the398 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.Union. The national government is that alone, whichcan safely or effectually execute it, with equal promptitudeand cheapness, certainty and uniformity. Alreadythe post-office establishment realizes a revenue exceedingtwo millions of dollars, from which it defrays all itsown expenses, and transmits mails in various directionsover more than one hundred and twenty thousand miles.It transmits intelligence in one day to distant places,which, when the constitution was first put into operation,was scarcely transmitted through the same distancein the course of a week. The rapidity of its movementshas been in a general view doubled within the lasttwenty years. There are now more than eight thousandfive hundred post-offices in the United States ;and at every session of the legislature new routes areconstantly provided for, and new post-offices established.It may, therefore, well be deemed a most beneficentpower, whose operations can scarcely be applied,except for good; accomplishing in an eminent degreesome of the high purposes set forth in the preambleof the constitution ; forming a more perfect union ; providingfor the common defence ; and promoting the generalwelfare.§ 553. Upon the construction of this clause of theconstitution, two opposite opinions have been expressed.One maintains, that the power to establish postofficesand post-roads can intend no more, than thepower to direct, where post-offices shall be kept, andon what roads the mails shall be carried. Or, as ithas been on other occasions expressed, the power toestablish post-roads is a power to designate, or point out,what roads shall be mail-roads, and the right of passageor way along them, when so designated. The othermaintains, that although these modes of exercising theCH. XVIII.] POWERS OF COJVGRESS-POST-OFFICE. 399power are perfectly constitutional ; yet they are not thewhole of the power, and do not exhaust it. On thecontrary, the power comprehends the right to make, orconstruct any roads, which congress may deem properfor the conveyance of the mail, and to keep them induerepair for such purpose.§ 554. The whole practical course of the governmentupon this subject, from its first organization downto the present time, under every administration, hasrepudiated the strict and narrow construction of thewords above mentioned. The power to establish postofficesand post-roads has never been understood tobe limited to the power to point out and designatepost-offices and post-roads. Resort has been constantlyhad to the more expanded sense of the wordestablish;" and no other sense can include the objects,which the post-office laws have constantly included.Nay, it is not only not true, that these laws have stoppedshort of an exposition of the words sufficientlybroad to justify the making of roads ; but they have includedexercises of power far more remote from theimmediate objects. If the practice of the governmentis, therefore, of any weight in giving a constitutionalinterpretation, it is in favour of the liberal interpretationof the clause.§ 555. But passing by considerations of this nature,why does not the power to establish post-offices andpost-roads include the power to make and constructthem, when wanted, as well as the power to establish anavy-hospital, or a custom-house, a power to make andconstruct them 1 The latter is not doubted by anypersons ; why then is' the former ? In each case, thesense of the ruling term " establish" would seem to bethesame; in each, the power may be carried into effect400 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.by means short of constructing, or purchasing the thingsauthorized. A temporary use of a suitable site orbuilding may possibly be obtained with, or withouthire. Besides ; why may not congress purchase, orerect a post-office building, and buy the necessaryland, if it be in their judgment advisable ? Can therebe a just doubt, that a power to establish post-officesincludes this power, just as much, as a power to establishcustom-houses would to build the latter ? Wouldit not be a strange construction to say, that the abstractoffice might be created, but not the officina, or place,where it should be exercised ? There are many placespeculiarly fit for local post-offices, where no suitablebuilding could be found. And, if a power to constructpost-office buildings exists, where is the restraint uponconstructing roads?^ 556. But whatever be the extent of the powernarrow or large, there will still remain another inquiry,whether it is an exclusive power, or concurrent in thestates. This is not, perhaps, a very important inquiry,because it is admitted on all sides, that it can be exercisedonly in subordination to the power of congress, ifit be concurrent in the states. A learned commentatordeems it concurrent, inasmuch as there seems nothingin the constitution, or in the nature of the thing itself,which may not be exercised by both governments atthe same time, without prejudice or interference ; butsubordinate, because, whenever any power is expresslygranted to congress, it is to be taken for granted, thatit is not to be contravened by the authority of any particularstate. A state might, therefore, establish a post-road,or post-office, on any route, where congress hadnot established any. On the other hand, another learnedcommentator is of opinion, that the power is exclude.XVIII.] POWERS OF CONGRESS-postoffice. 401sive in congress, so far as relates to the conveyance ofletters. Hitherto the question has been purely speculative; and it cannot now be important to discuss it.It is highly improbable, that any state will attempt anyexercise of the power, considering the difficulty ofcarrying it into effect, without the co-operation of congress.Ahr,402 CONSTITUTION OF THE U.

The next power of congress is, " to promotethe progress of science and the useful arts, by securing,for limited times, to authors and inventors theexclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries."^ 558. This power did not exist under the confederation; and its utility does not seem to have beenquestioned. The copyright of authors in their workshad, before the revolution, been decided in Great Britainto be a common law right ; and it was regulated andlimited under statutes passed by parliament upon thatsubject. The right to useful inventions seems, withequal reason, to belong to the inventors ; and, accordingly,it was saved out of the statute of monopolies inthe reign of King James the First, and has ever sincebeen allowed for a limited period, not exceeding fourteenyears. It is doubdess to this knowledge of thecommon law and statuteable rights of authors and inventors,that we are to attribute this constitutionalprovision. It is beneficial to all parties, that thenational government should possess this power ; toauthors and inventors, because, otherwise, they wouldbe subjected to the varying laws and systems ofthe different states on this subject, which would impair,and might even destroy the value of their rights ;to the public, as it will promote the progress ofscience and the useful arts, and admit the people atlarge, after a short interval, to the full possession andCH. XIX.] POWERS OF CONGRESS INVENTIONS. 403enjoyment of all writings and inventions without restraint.In short, the only boon that could be offeredto inventors to disclose the secrets of their discoveries,would be the exclusive right and profit of them, as amonopoly, for a limited period. And authors wouldhave little inducement to prepare elaborate works forthe public, if the publication of them would be at a largeexpense, and, as soon as they were published, therewould be an unlimited right of depredation and piracyof their copyright. The states could not separatelymake effectual provision for either of the cases ; andmost of them, at the time of the adoption of the constitution,had anticipated the propriety of such a grant ofpower, by passing laws on the subject, at the instanceof the continental congress.^ 559. The power, in its terms, is confined toauthors and inventors ; and cannot be extended to theintroducers of any new works or inventions. This hasbeen thought by some persons of high distinction to beadefect in the constitution. But perhaps the policy offurther extending the right is questionable ; and, at allevents, the restriction has not hitherto operated as anydiscouragement of science or the arts. It has beendoubted, whether congress has authority to decide thefact, that a person is an author or inventor in the senseof the constitution, so as to preclude that questionfrom judicial inquiry. But, at all events, such a constructionought never to be put upon the general termsof any act in favour of a particular inventor, unless itbe inevitable.^ 560. The next power of congress is, " to constitutetribunals inferior to the Supreme Court." Thisclause properly belongs to the third article of the condorCONSTITUTION OP THE U. STATES. [BOOK Iiisituation ; and will come in review, when we surveythe structure and powers of the judicial department.It will, therefore, be, for the present, passedover.CH. XX,] POWERS OF CONGRESS — PIRACY. 405CHAPTER XX.POWER TO PUNISH PIRACIES AND FELONIES.., ^661. The next power of congress is, "to define"and punish piracies and felonies committed on thehigh seas, and offences against the law of nations."^ 562. If the clause of the constitution had beenconfined to piracies, there would not have been anynecessity of conferring the power to define the crime,since the power to punish would necessarily be held toinclude the power of ascertaining and fixing the definitionof the crime. Indeed, there would not seem to betheslightest reason to define the crime at all ; for piracyis perfectly well known, and understood in the law ofnations, though it is often found defined in mere municipalcodes. By the law of nations, robbery, or forcibledepredation upon the sea, aninio fiirandi, is piracy.The common law, too, recognises, and punishes piracyas an offence, not against its own municipal code, butas an offence against the universal law of nations ; apirate being deemed an enemy of the human race.The common law, therefore, deems piracy to be robberyon the sea ; that is, the same crime, which it denominatesrobbery, when committed on land. And ifcongress had simply declared, that piracy should bepunished with death, the crime would have been sufficientlydefined. Congress may as well define by usinga term of a known and determinate meaning, as by anexpress enumeration of all the particulars included inthat term ; for that is certain, which, by reference, ismade certain. If congress should declare murder a406 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.felony, no body would doubt, what was intended bymurder. And, indeed, if congress should proceed todeclare, that homicide, "with malice aforethought,"should be deemed murder, and a felony; there wouldstill be the same necessity of ascertaining, from thecommon law, what constitutes malice aforethought.So, that there would be no end to difficulties or definitions; for each successive definition might involve someterms, which would still require some new explanation.The true intent of the constitution in thisclause, is not merely to define piracy, as .known to thelaw of nations, but to enumerate what crimes in thenational code shall be deemed piracies. And so thepower has been practically expounded by congress.§ 563. But the power is not merely to define andpunish piracies, but felonies, and offences against thelaw of nations ; and on this account, the power todefine, as well as to punish, is peculiarly appropriate.It has been remarked, that felony is a term of loose signification,even in the common law; and of variousimport in the statute law of England. Mr. JusticeBlackstone says, that felony, in the general acceptationof the English law, comprises every species of crime,which occasioned at common law the forfeiture oflands and goods. This most frequently happens inthose crimes, for which a capital punishment either is,or was liable to be inflicted. All offences now capitalby the English law are felonies ; but there are still someoffences, not capital, which are yet felonies, (such assuicide, petty larceny, and homicide by chance medley;) that is, they subject the committers of them tosome forfeiture, either of lands or goods. But theidea of capital punishment has now become so associated,in the English law, with the idea of felony, that ifCH. XX.] POWERS OF CONGRESS PIRACY.an act of parliament makes a new offence felony, thelaw implies, that it shall be punished with death, as wellas with forfeiture.^ 564. But whatever may be the true import of theword felony at the common law, in regard to municipaloffences, its meaning, in regard to offences on thehigh seas, is necessarily somewhat indeterminate ;since the term is not used in the criminal jurisprudenceof the Admiralty in the technical sense of the commonlaw. Lord Coke long ago stated, that a pardon offelonies would not pardon piracy ; for " piracy or robberyon the high seas was no felony, whereof the commonlaw took any knowledge, &c. ; but was only punishableby the civil law, &c. ; the attainder by whichlaw wrought no forfeiture of lands or corruption ofblood." And he added, that the statute of 28 Henry8, ch. 15, which created the High Commission Courtfor the trial of " all treasons, felonies, robberies, murders,and confederacies, committed in or upon the highsea, &c.," did not alter the offence, or make the offencefelony, but left the offence as it was before theact, viz. felony only by the civil law.^ 565. Offences against the law of nations are quiteas important, and cannot with any accuracy be said to becompletely ascertained, and defined in any public code,recognised by the common consent of nations. Inrespect, therefore, as well to felonies on the high seas,as to offences against the law of nations, there is a peculiarfitness in giving to congress the power to define,as well as to punish. And there is not the slightestreason to doubt, that this consideration had very greatweight with the convention, in producing the phraseologyof the clause. On both subjects it would havebeen inconvenient, if not impracticable, to have referred408 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III,to the codes of the states, as well from their imperfection,as their different enumeration of the offences.Certainty, as well as uniformity, required, that thepower to define and punish should reach over thewhole of these classes of offences.^566. What is the meaning of " high seas," withinthe intent of this clause, does not seem to admit of anyserious doubt. The phrase embraces not only thewaters of the ocean, which are out of sight of land, butthe waters on the sea coast below low water mark,whether within the territorial boundaries of a foreignnation, or of a domestic state. Mr. Justice Blackstonehas remarked, that the main sea or high sea begins atthe low water mark. But between the high watermarkand low water mark, where the tide ebbs andflows, the common law and the admiralty havedivisor imperium an alternate jurisdiction, one uponthe water, when it is full sea ; the other upon the land,when it is an ebb. He doubtless here refers to thewaters of the ocean on the sea-coast, and not in creeksand inlets. Lord Hale says, that the sea is either that,which lies within the body of the county, or without.That, which lies without the body of a county, is calledthe main sea, or ocean. So far, then, as regards thestates of the Union, " high seas" may be taken to meanthat part of the ocean, which washes the sea-coast, andis without the body of any county, according to thecommon law ; and, so far as regards foreign nations, anywaters on their sea-coast, below low water mark.CH. XXI.] POWERS OF CONGRESS WAR. 409CHAPTER XXI.THE POWER TO DECLARE WAR AND MAKECAPTURES.§ 567. The next power of congress is to " declarewar, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and makerules concerning captures on land and water."§ 568. A similar exclusive power was given tocongress by the confederation. That such a powerought to exist in the national government, no one willdeny, who believes, that it ought to have any powerswhatsoever, either for offence or defence, for the commongood, or for the common protection. It is, therefore,wholly superfluous to reason out the propriety ofgranting the power. It is self-evident, unless the nationalgovernment is to be a mere mockery andshadow. The power could not be left without extrememischief, if not absolute ruin, to the separate authorityof the several states ; for then it would be atthe option of any one to involve the whole in the calamitiesand burthens of warfare. In the general governmentit is safe, because war can be declared onlyby the majority of the states, in congress.^ 569. The only practical question upon this subjectwould seem to be, to what department of the nationalgovernment it would be most wise and safe to confidethis high prerogative, emphatically called the last resortof sovereigns, ultima ratio rerum. In Great Britainit is the exclusive prerogative of the crown ; and inother countries, it is usually, if not universally, confidedto the executive department. It might by the constitute.52410 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.tion have been confided to the executive, or to thesenate, or to both conjointly.§ 570. In the plan offered by an eminent statesmanin the convention, it was proposed, that the senateshould have the sole power of declaring war. Thereasons, which may be urged in favour of such anarrangement, are, that the senate would be composedof representatives of the states, of great weight, sagacity,and experience, and that being a small and selectbody, promptitude of action, as well as wisdom, andfirmness, would, as they ought, accompany the possessionof the power. Large bodies necessarily moveslowly ; and where the co-operation of different bodiesis required, the retardation of any measure must beproportionally increased. In the ordinary course oflegislation this may be no inconvenience. But in theexercise of such a prerogative, as declaring war, despatch,secrecy, and vigour are often indispensable, andalways useful towards success. On the other hand itmay be urged in reply, that the power of declaringwar is not only the highest sovereign prerogative, butthat it is in its own nature and effects so critical and calamitous,that it requires the utmost deliberation, andthe successive review of all the councils of the nation.War, in its best estate, never fails to impose upon thepeople the most burthensome taxes, and personal sufferings.It is always injurious to, and sometimes subversiveof the great commercial, manufacturing, andagricultural interests. Nay, it always involves theprosperity, and not unfrequently the existence, of anation. It is sometimes fatal to public liberty itself, byintroducing a spirit of military glory, which is readyto follow, wherever a successful commander willlead ; and in a republic, whose institutions are essence.XXI.] POWERS OF CONGRESS WAR 411tally founded on the basis of peace, there is infinitedanger, that war will find it both imbecile in defence,and eager for contest. Indeed, the history of republicshas but too fatally proved, that they are too ambitiousof military fame and conquest, and too easily devotedto the views of demagogues, who flatter their pride,and betray their interests. It should therefore bedifficult in a republic to declare war ; but not to makepeace.The representatives of the people are to laythe taxes to support a war, and therefore have a right tobe consulted, as to its propriety and necessity. Theexecutive is to carry it on, and therefore should beconsulted, as to its time, and the ways and means ofmaking it effective. The co-operation of all the branchesof the legislative power ought, upon principle, to be requiredin this the highest act of legislation, as it is in allothers. Indeed, there might be a propriety even inenforcing still greater restrictions, as by requiring a concurrenceof two thirds of both houses.§ 571. This reasoning appears to have had greatweight with the convention, and to have decided itschoice. Its judgment has hitherto obtained the unqualifiedapprobation of the country.§ 572. The power to declare war would of itselfcarry the incidental power to grant letters of marqueand reprisal, and make rules concerning captures. It ismost probable, that an extreme solicitude to follow outthe powers, enumerated in the confederation, occasionedthe introduction of these clauses into the constitution. Inthe former instrument, where all powers, not expresslydelegated, were prohibited, this enumeration was peculiarlyappropriate. But in the latter, where incidentalpowers were expressly contemplated, and provided for,the same necessity did not exist. As has been already412 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.remarked in another place, and will abundantly appearfrom the remaining clauses auxiliary to the power todeclare war, the constitution abounds with pleonasmsand repetitions, sometimes introduced from caution,sometimes from inattention, and sometimes from theimperfections of language.§ 573. But the express power " to grant letters ofmarque and reprisal" may not have been thought whollyunnecessary, because it is often a measure of peace, toprevent the necessity of a resort to war. Thus, individualsof a nation sometimes suffer from the depredationsof foreign potentates; and yet it may not bedeemed either expedient or necessary to redress suchgrievances by a general declaration of war. Undersuch circumstances the law of nations authorizes thesovereign of the injured individual to grant him thismode of redress, whenever justice is denied to him bythe state, to which the party, who has done the injury,belongs. In this case the letters of marque and reprisal(words used as synonymous, the latter (reprisal) signifying,a taking in return, the former (letters of marque)the License to pass the frontiers in order to such taking,)contain an authority to seize the bodies or goods ofthe subjects of the offending state, wherever they maybefound, until satisfaction is made for the injury.This power of reprisal seems indeed to be a dictatealmost of nature itself, and is nearly related to, andplainly derived from that of making war. It is but anincomplete state of hostilities; and often ultimately leadsto a formal denunciation of war, if the injury is unredressed,or extensive in its operations.^ 574. The next power of congress is " to raise andsupport armies; but no appropriation of money to thatuse shall be for a longer term than two years."CH. XXI.] POWERS OF CONGRESS WAR. 413^ 475. The power to raise armies is an indispensableincident to the power to declare war ; andthe latter would Literally be irutum fulmen withoutthe former, a means of mischief without a power ofdefence. Under the confederation congress possessedno power whatsoever to raise armies ; but only " toagree upon the number of land forces, and to makerequisitions from each state for its quota, in proportionto the number of white inhabitants in such state ; " whichrequisitions were to be binding; and thereupon the legislatureof each state were to appoint the regimental officers,raise the men, and clothe, arm, and equip them inasoldier-like manner, at the expense of the UnitedStates. The experience of the whole country, duringthe revolutionary war, established, to the satisfaction ofevery statesman, the utter inadequacy and improprietyof this system of requisition. It was equally at warwith economy, efficiency, and safety. It gave birth toa competition between the states, which created a kindof auction of men. In order to furnish the quotasrequired of them, they outbid each other, till bountiesgrew to an enormous and insupportable size. On thisaccount many persons procrastinated their enlistment, orenlisted only for short periods. Hence, there were butslow and scanty levies of men in the most critical emergenciesof our affairs ; short enlistments at an unparalleledexpense ; and continual fluctuations in the troops,ruinous to their discipline, and subjecting the publicsafety frequently to the perilous crisis of a disbandedarmy. Hence also arose those oppressive expedientsfor raising men, which were occasionally practised, andwhich nothing, but the enthusiasm of liberty, could haveinduced the people to endure. The burthen was alsovery unequally distributed. The states near the seat of414 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.war, influenced by motives of self-preservation, madeefforts to furnish their quotas, which even exceededtheir abilities ; while those at a distance were exceedinglyremiss in their exertions. In short, the army wasfrequently composed of three bodies of men; first, rawrecruits ; secondly, persons, who were just about completingtheir term of service ; and thirdly, of persons,who had served out half their term, and were quietlywaiting for its determination. Under such circumstances,the wonder is not, that its military operations weretardy, irregular, and often unsuccessful ; but, that it wasever able to make head-way at all against an enemy,possessing a fine establishment, well appointed, wellarmed, well clothed, and well paid. The appointment,too, by the states, of all regimental officers, had a tendencyto destroy all harmony and subordination, so necessaryto the success of military life.^ 476. There is great wisdom and propriety in relievingthe government from the ponderous and unwieldymachinery of the requisitions and appointments underthe confederation. The present system of the Union isgeneral and direct, and capable of a uniform organizationand action. It is essential to the common defence,that the national government should possess thepower to raise armies ; build and equip fleets ; prescriberules for the government of both ; direct theiroperations ; and provide for their support. The power,however, was assailed in the state conventions, and beforethe people, with incredible zeal and pertinacity, asdangerous to liberty, and subversive of the state governments.Objections were made against the generaland indefinite power to raise armies, not limiting thenumber of troops ; and to the maintenance of them inpeace, as well as in war.CH. XXI.] POWERS OF CONGRESS WAR. 415§ 577. To these suggestions it was replied withequal force and truth, that to be of any value, the powermust be unlimited. It is impossible to foresee, ordefine the extent and variety of national exigencies,and the correspondent extent and variety of the nationalmeans necessary to satisfy them. The power must beco-extensive with all possible combinations of circumstances,and under the direction of the councils entrustedwith the common defence. To deny this would beto deny the means, and yet require the end. Thesemust therefore, be unlimited in every matter essentialto its efficacy, that is, in the formation, direction, andsupport of the national forces. This was not doubtedunder the confederation ; though the mode adopted tocarry it into effect was utterly inadequate and illusory.^ 578. It is important also to consider, that the surestmeans of avoiding war is to be prepared for it in peace.If a prohibition should be imposed upon the UnitedStates against raising armies in time of peace, it wouldpresent the extraordinary spectacle to the world of anation incapacitated by a constitution of its own choicefrom preparing for defence before an actual invasion.As formal denunciations of war are in modern times oftenneglected, and are never necessary, the presence of anenemy within our territories would be required, beforethe government would be warranted to begin levies ofmen for the protection of the state. The blow mustbe received, before any attempts could be made towardit off, or to return it. Such a course of conductwould at all times invite aggression and insult; andenable a formidable rival or secret enemy to seize uponthe country, as a defenceless prey; or to drain its resourcesby a levy of contributions, at once irresistibleand ruinous. It would be in vain to look to the militia416 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.for an adequate defence under such circumstances. Thisreliance came very near losing us our independence,and was the occasion of the useless expenditure ofmany millions.§ 579. The next power of congress is " to provideand maintain a navy."§ 580. Under the confederation congress possessedthe power " to build and equip a navy." i?he samelanguage was adopted in the original draft of the constitution,and it was amended by substituting the presentwords, apparently without objection, as more broadand appropriate. In the convention, the propriety ofgranting the power seems not to have been questioned.But it was assailed in the state conventions as dangerous.It was said, that commerce and navigation arethe principal sources of the wealth of the maritimepowers of Europe ; and if we engaged in commerce,we should soon become their rivals. A navy wouldsoon be thought indispensable to protect it. But theattempt on our part to provide a navy would provokethese powers, who would not suffer us to become anaval power. Thus, we should be immediately involvedin wars with them. The expenses, too, of maintaininga suitable navy would be enormous ; and whollydisproportionate to our resources. If a navy should beprovided at all, it ought to be limited to the mere protectionof our trade. It was further urged, that theSouthern states would share a large portion of the burthensof maintaining a navy, without any correspondingadvantages.^581. With the nation at large these objectionswere not deemed of any validity. The necessity of anavy for the protection of commerce and navigationwas not only admitted, but made a strong ground forCH. XXI.] POWERS OF CONGRESS NAVY. 417the grant of the power. One of the great objects ofthe constitution was the encouragement and protectionof navigation and trade. Without a navy, it would beutterly impossible to maintain our right to the fisheries,and our trade and navigation on the lakes, and the Mississippi,as well as our foreign commerce. It was oneof the blessings of the Union, that it would be able toprovide an adequate support and protection for all theseimportant objects. Besides ; a navy would be absolutelyindispensable to protect our whole Atlantic frontier,in case of a war with a foreign maritime power.We should otherwise be liable, not only to the invasionof strong regular forces of the enemy ; but to the attacksand incursions of every predatory adventurer.Our maritime towns might all be put under contribution ;and even the entrance and departure from our ownports be interdicted at the caprice, or the hostility of aforeign power. It would also be our cheapest, as wellas our best defence ; as it would save us the expenseof numerous forts and garrisons upon the sea-coast,which, though not effectual for all, would still be requiredfor some purposes. In short, in a maritime warfare,without this means of defence, our commerce would bedriven from the ocean, our ports would be blockaded,our sea-coast infested with plunderers, and our vital interestsput at hazard.§ 582. Although these considerations were decisivewith the people at large in favour of the power, fromits palpable necessity and importance to all the greatinterest s of the country, it is within the memory of allof us, that the same objections for a long time prevailedwith a leading party in the country. It was not untilduring the late war with Great Britain, when our littlenavy, by a gallantry and brilliancy of achievement al-air.53418 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.most without parallel, had literally fought itself into favour,that the nation at large began to awake from itslethargy on this subject, and to insist upon a policy,which should at once make us respected and formidableabroad, and secure protection and honor at home.It has been proudly said by a learned commentator onthe laws of England, that the royal navy of Englandhath ever been its greatest defence and ornament. Itis its ancient and natural strength ; the floating bulwarkof the island ; an army, from which, howeverstrong and powerful, no danger can be apprehended toliberty. Every American citizen ought to cherish thesame sentiment, as applicable to the navy of his owncountry.^ 583. The next power of congress is " to makerules for the government and regulation of the land andnaval forces." This is a natural incident to the precedingpowers to make war, to raise armies, and to provideand maintain a navy. Its propriety, therefore,scarcely could be, and never has been denied, and neednot now be insisted on. The clause was not in theoriginal draft of the constitution ; but was added withoutobjection by way of amendment. It was withoutquestion borrowed from a corresponding clause in thearticles of confederation, where it was with more proprietygiven, because there was a prohibition of all impliedpowers. In Great Britain, the king, in his capacityof generalissimo of the whole kingdom, has the solepower of regulating fleets and armies. But parliamenthas repeatedly interposed ; and the regulation of bothis now in a considerable measure provided for by actsof parliament. The whole power is far more safe inthe hands of congress, than of the executive ; sinceotherwise the most summary and severe punishmentsmight be inflicted at the mere will of the executive.CH. XXI.] POWERS OF CONGRESS NAVY. 419^ 584. It is a natural result of the sovereignty overthe navy of the United States, that it should be exclusive.Whatever crimes, therefore, are .committed onboardof public ships of war of the United States,whether they are in port or at sea, they are exclusivelycognizable and punishable by the government of theUnited States.

STATES. [bOOK III.CHAPTER XXII.POWER OVER THE MILITIA.§ 585. The next power of congress is " to provide forcalling forth the militia to execute the laws of theUnion, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions."^ 586. This clause seems, after a slight amendment,to have passed the convention without opposition. Itcured a defect severely felt under the confederation,which contained no provision on the subject.§ 587. The power of regulating the militia, and ofcommanding its services to enforce the laws, and tosuppress insurrections, and repel invasions, is a naturalincident to the duty of superintending the common defence,and preserving the internal peace of the nation.In short, every argument, which is urged, or can beurged against standing armies in time of peace, appliesforcibly to the propriety of vesting this power in thenational government. There is but one of two alternatives,which can be resorted to in cases of insurrection,invasion, or violent opposition to the laws ; either to employregular troops, or to employ the militia to suppressthem. In ordinary cases, indeed, the resistanceto the laws may be put down by the posse comitatus,or the assistance of the common magistracy. But casesmay occur, in which such a resort would be utterlyvain, and even mischievous ; since it might encouragethe factious to more rash measures, and prevent theapplication of a force, which would at once destroy thehopes and crush the efforts of the disaffected. Thegeneral power of the government to pass all laws need.XXII.] POWERS OF CONGRESS MILITIA. 421pessary and proper to execute its declared powers,would doubtless authorize laws to call forth the possecomitatus, and employ the common magistracy, in cases,where such measures would suit the emergency. Butif the militia could not be called in aid, it would be absolutelyindispensable to the common safety to keep up astrong regular force in time of peace. The latter wouldcertainly not be desirable, or economical ; and thereforethis power over the militia is highly salutary to the publicrepose, and at the same time an additional securityto the public liberty. In times of insurrection or invasion,it would be natural and proper, that the militia ofa neighbouring state should be marched into another toresist a common enemy, or guard the republic againstthe violences of a domestic faction or sedition. But itis scarcely possible, that in the exercise of the powerthe militia should ever be called to march great distances,since it would be at once the most expensive andthe most inconvenient force, which the government couldemploy for distant expeditions. The regulation of thewhole subject is always to be in the power of congress ;and it may from time to time be moulded so, as toescape from all dangerous abuses.^ 588. The next power of congress is, " to provide"for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, andfor governing such part of them, as may be employed"in the service of the United States; reserving to thestates respectively the appointment of the officers,and the authority of training the militia according tothe discipline prescribed by congress."^ 589. This power, has a natural connexion with thepreceding, and, if not indispensable to its exercise, furnishesthe only adequate means of giving it promptitudeand efficiency in its operations. It requires no422 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.skill in the science of war to discern, that uniformity inthe organization and discipline of the militia will be attendedwith the most beneficial effects, whenever theyare called into active service. It will enable them todischarge the duties of the camp and field with mutualintelligence and concert, an advantage of peculiar momentin the operations of an army ; and it will enablethem to acquire, in a much shorter period, that degreeof proficiency in military functions, which is essential totheir usefulness. Such an uniformity, it is evident, canbe attained only through the superintending power ofthe national government.§ 590. Several questions of great practical importancehave arisen under the clauses of the constitutionrespecting the militia, which deserve mentionin this place. It is observable, that power is givento congress " to provide for calling forth the militiato execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections,and repel invasions." Accordingly, congressin 1795, in pursuance of this authority, and to give it apractical operation, provided by law, " that wheneverthe United States shall be invaded, or be in imminentdanger of invasion from any foreign nation or Indiantribe, it shall be lawful for the president to call forthsuch number of the militia of the state, or states mostconvenient to the place of danger, or scene of action,as he may judge necessary, to repel such invasion, andto issue his order for that purpose to such officer orofficers of the militia, as he shall think proper." Likeprovisions are made for the other cases stated in theconstitution. The constitutionality of this act has notbeen questioned, although it provides for calling forththe militia, not only in cases invasion, but of imminentdanger of invasion ; for the power to repel invasionsCH. XXII.] POWERS OF CONGRESS MILITIA. 423must include the power to provide against any attemptand danger of invasion, as the necessary and propermeans to effectuate the object. One of the best meansto repel invasion is, to provide the requisite force foraction, before the invader has reached the territory ofthe nation. Nor can there be a doubt, that the president,who is (as will be presently seen) by the constitutionthe commander-in-chief of the army and navy ofthe United States, and of the militia, when called into theactual service of the United States, is the proper functionary,to whom this high and delicate trust ought tobe confided. A free people will naturally be jealous ofthe exercise of military power; and that of calling forththe militia is certainly one of no ordinary magnitude.It is, however, a power limited in its nature to certainexigencies ; and by whomsoever it is to be executed, itcarries with it a corresponding responsibility. Who isso fit to exercise the power, and to incur the responsibility,as the president ?^591. But a most material question arises : Bywhom is the exigency to be decided 1 Is the presidentthe sole and exclusive judge, whether the exigency hasarisen ? Or is it to be considered, as an open question,which every officer, to whom the orders of the presidentare addressed, may decide for himself, and equallyopen to be contested, by every militia-man, whoshall refuse to obey the orders of the president ?^ 592. At a very recent period, the question camebefore the Supreme Court of the United States for ajudicial decision; and it was then unanimously determined,that the authority to decide, whether the exigencyhas arisen, belongs exclusively to the president ;and that his decision is conclusive upon all other persons.The court said, that this construction necessaryCONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.rely resulted from the nature of the power itself, andfrom the manifest objects contemplated by the act ofcongress. The power itself is to be exercised uponsudden emergencies, upon great occasions of state, andunder circumstances, which may be vital to the existenceof the Union. A prompt and unhesitating obedienceto orders is indispensable to the complete attainmentof the object. The service is a military service,and the command of a military nature ; and insuch cases, every delay and every obstacle to an efficientand immediate compliance would necessarily tendto jeopard the public interests. While subordinate officersor soldiers are pausing to consider, whether theyought to obey, or are scrupulously weighing the facts,upon which the commander-in-chief exercises the rightto demand their services, the hostile enterprize may beaccomplished, without the means of resistance. If thepower of regulating the militia, and of commanding itsservices in times of insurrection and invasion, are, as ithas been emphatically said, they are, natural incidentsto the duties of superintending the common defence,and of watching over the internal peace of the confederacy,these powers must be so construed, as to themodes of their exercise, as not to defeat the great endin view. If a superior officer has a right to contest theorders of the president, upon his own doubts, as to theexigency having arisen, it must be equally the right ofevery inferior officer and soldier. And any act doneby any person in furtherance of such orders wouldsubject li m to responsibility in a civil suit, in which hisdefence must finally rest upon his ability to establishthe facts by competent proofs. Besides ; in many instancesthe evidence, upon which the president mightdecides that there was imminent danger of invasion,eft. hill.] POWERS OF CONGRESS MILITIA. 425might be of a nature not constituting strict technicalproof ; or the disclosure of the evidence might revealimportant state secrets, which the public interest, andeven safety, might imperiously demand to be kept inconcealment.^ 593. The power to govern the militia, when in theactual service of the United States, is denied by no oneto be an exclusive one. Indeed, from its very nature,it must be so construed; for the notion of distinct andindependent orders from authorities wholly unconnected,would be utterly inconsistent with that unity ofcommand and action, on which the success of all militaryoperations must essentially depend. But there isnothing in the constitution, which prohibits a state fromcalling forth its own miHtia, not detached into the serviceof the Union, to aid the United States in executingthe laws, in suppressing insurrections, and in repellinginvasions. Such a concurrent exercise of power in nodegree interferes with, or obstructs the exercise of thepowers of the Union. Congress may, by suitable laws,provide for the calling forth of the militia, and annexsuitable penalties to disobedience of their orders, anddirect the manner, in which the delinquents may betried. But the authority to call forth, and the authorityexclusively to govern, are quite distinct in their nature.The question, when the authority of congress over themilitia becomes exclusive, must essentially depend uponthe fact, when they are to be deemed in the actual serviceof the United States. There is a clear distinctionbetween calling forth the militia, and their being inactual service. These are not contemporaneous acts,nor necessarily identical in their constitutional bearings.The president is commander-in-chief of the militia,when in actual service ; and not, when they are .54426 Constitution OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.\y ordered into service. They are subjected tomartial law only, when in actual service, and notmerely when called forth, before they have obeyed thecall.ICH. XXIII.] POWERS OF CONGRESS — CESSIONS. 427CHAPTER XXIII.POWER OVER SEAT OF GOVERNMENT AND OTHERCEDED PLACES.§ 594. The next power of congress is, "to exerciseexclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over suchdistrict, not exceeding ten miles square, as may, bycession of particular states and the acceptance of congress,become the seat of the government of the"United States ; and to exercise like authority over allplaces purchased by the consent of the legislature ofthe state, in which the same shall be, for the erection"of FORTS, MAGAZINES, ARSENALS, and Other needfulbuildings."§ 595. The indispensable necessity of complete andexclusive power, on the part of the congress, at the seatof government, carries its own evidence with it. It is apower exercised by every legislature of the Union, andone might say of the world, by virtue of its general supremacy.Without it, not only the public authoritiesmight be insulted, and their proceedings be interruptedwith impunity ; but the public archives might be indanger of violation, and destruction, and a dependenceof the members of the national government on the stateauthorities for protection in the discharge of their functionsbe created, which would bring upon the nationalcouncils the imputation of being subjected to undue aweand influence, and might, in times of high excitement,expose their Hves to jeopardy. It never could be safeto leave in possession of any state the exclusive powerto decide, whether the functionaries of the national CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [boni iii.ernest should have the moral or physical power toperform their duties. It might subject the favoured stateto the most unrelenting jealousy of the other states, andintroduce earnest controversies from time to time respectingthe removal of the seat of government.§ 596. Nor can the cession be justly an object ofjealousy to any state ; or in the slightest degree impairits sovereignty. The ceded district is of a very narrowextent ; and it rests in the option of the state, whetherit shall be made or not. There can be little doubt, thatthe inhabitants composing it would receive with thankfulnesssuch a blessing, since their own importancewould be thereby increased, their interests be subserved,and their rights be under the immediate protectionof the representatives of the whole Union. It is notimprobable, that an occurrence, at the very close of therevolutionary war, had a great effect in introducing thisprovision into the constitution. At the period alludedto, the congress, then sitting at Philadelphia, was surrounded,and insulted by a small, but insolent body ofmutineers of the continental army. Congress appliedto the executive authority of Pennsylvania for defence ;but, under the ill-conceived constitution of the state atthat time, the executive power was vested in a councilconsisting of thirteen members ; and they possessed, orexhibited so little energy, and such apparent intimidation,that congress indignantly removed to New-jersey,whose inhabitants welcomed them with promises ofdefending them. Congress remained for some time atPrinceton without being again insulted, till, for the sakeof greater convenience, they adjourned to Annapolis.The general dissatisfaction with the proceedings ofPennsylvania, and the degrading spectacle of a fugitivecongress, were sufficiently striking to produce thisCH. XXIII.] POWERS OF Congress CESSIONS. 429remedy. Indeed, if such a lesson could have been lostupon the people, it would have been as humiliating totheir intelligence, as it would have been offensive totheir honour.§ 597. The other part of the power, giving exclusivelegislation over places ceded for the erection of forts,magazines, &c., seems still more necessary for thepublic convenience and safety. The public money expendedon such places, and the public property depositedin them, and the nature of the military duties, whichmay be required there, all demand, that they should beexempted from state authority. In truth, it would bewholly improper, that places, on which the security ofthe entire Union may depend, should be subjected tothe control of any member of it. The power, indeed,is wholly unexceptionable ; since it can only be exercisedat the will of the state ; and it is therefore placedbeyond all reasonable scruple.§ 598. A great variety of cessions have been madeby the states under this power. And generally therehas been a reservation of the right to serve all stateprocess, civil and criminal, upon persons found therein.This reservation has not been thought at all inconsistentwith the provisions of the constitution ; for the stateprocess, quoad hoc, becomes the process of of the UnitedStates, and the general power of exclusive legislationremains with congress. Thus, these places are notcapable of being made a sanctuary for fugitives, to exemptthem from acts done within, and cognizable by,the states, to which the territory belonged ; and at thesame time congress is enabled to accomplish the greatobjects of the power.^ 599. The power of congress to exercise exclusivejurisdiction over these ceded places is conferred on430 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.that body, as the legislature of the Union ; and cannotbe exercised in any other character. A law passed inpursuance of it is the supreme law of the land, and bindingon all the states, and cannot be defeated by them.The power to pass such a law carries with it all the incidentalpowers to give it complete and effectual execution; and such a law may be extended in its operationincidentally throughout the United States, ifcongress think it necessary so to do. But if intendedto have efficiency beyond the district, language must beused in the act expressive of such an intention; otherwiseit will be deemed purely local.CH. XXIV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS INCIDENTAL. 431CHAPTER XXIV.POWERS OF CONGRESS INCIDENTAL.§ 600. The next power of congress is, "to makeall laws, which shall be necessary and proper for carryinginto execution the foregoing powers, and allother powers vested by this constitution in the goveminent of the United States, or in any department,or officer thereof."§ 601. Few powers of the government were at thetime of the adoption of the constitution assailed withmore severe invective, and more declamatory intemperance,than this. And it has ever since been made atheme of constant attack, and extravagant jealousy. Yetit is difficult to perceive the grounds, upon which any objectioncan be maintained, or the logic, by which it can bereasoned out. The clause is only declaratory of a truth,which would have resulted by necessary and unavoidableimplication from the very act of establishing the nationalgovernment, and investing it with certain powers. Whatis a power, but the ability or faculty of doing a thing ?What is the ability to do a thing, but the power of employingthe means necessary to its execution 7 Whatis a legislative power, but a power of making laws ?What are the means to execute a legislative pov^^er, butlaws? What is the power for instance, of layingand collecting taxes, but a legislative power, or apower to make laws to lay and collect taxes ? Whatare the proper means of executing such a power, butnecessary and proper laws 7 In truth, the constitutionaloperation of the government would be precisely the432 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.same, if the clause were obliterated, as if it were repeatedin every article. It would otherwise result, thatthe power could never be exercised ; that is, the endwould be required, and yet no means allowed. Thiswould be a perfect absurdity. It would be to createpowers, and compel them to remain for ever in a torpid,dormant, and paralytic state. It cannot, therefore, bedenied, that the powers, given by the constitution, implythe ordinary means of execution ; for without the substanceof the power the constitution would be a deadletter.^ 602. If, then, the clause imports no more, thanwould result from necessary implication, it may be asked,why it was inserted at all. The true answer isthat such a clause was peculiarly useful, in order toavoid any doubt, Which ingenuity or jealousy mightraise upon the subject. Much plausible reasoningmight be employed by those, who were hostile to theUnion, and in favour of state power, to prejudice thepeople on such a subject, and to embarrass the governmentin all its reasonable operations. Besides; asthe confederation contained a positive clause, restrainingthe authority of congress to powers expresslygranted, there was a fitness in declaring, that that ruleof interpretation should no longer prevail. The veryzeal, indeed, with which the present clause has beenalways assailed, is the highest proof of its importanceand propriety. It has narrowed down the grounds ofhostility to the mere interpretation of the terms.§ 603. The plain import of the clause is, that congressshall have all the incidental and instrumentalpowers, necessary and proper to carry into executionall the express powers. It neither enlarges any powerspecifically granted ; nor is it a grant of any newCH. XXIV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS-INCIDENTAL. 433power to congress. But it is merely a declaration forthe removal of all uncertainty, that the means of carryinginto execution those, otherwise granted, are includedin the grant. Whenever, therefore, a question arisesconcerning the constitutionality of a particular power, thefirst question is, whether the power be expressed in theconstitution. If it be, the question is decided. If itbe not expressed, the next inquiry must be, whether it isproperly an incident to an express power, and necessaryand proper to its execution. If it be, then itmay be exercised by congress. If not, congress cannotexercise it.^ 604. But still a ground of controversy remainsopen, as to the true interpretation of the terms ofthe clause ; and it has been contested with no smallshare of earnestness and vigour. What, then, is thetrue constitutional sense of the words " necessaryand proper " in this clause 7 It has been insisted bythe advocates of a rigid interpretation, that the wordnecessary " is here used in its close and most intensemeaning; so that it is equivalent to absolutely andindispensably necessary. It has been said, that theconstitution allows only the means, which are necessary; not those, which are merely convenient for effectingthe enumerated powers. If such a latitude ofconstruction be given to this phrase, as to include anynon-enumerated power, it will go far to include everyone; for there is no one, which ingenuity might nottorture into a convenience in some way or other tosome one of so long a list of enumerated powers. Itwould swallow up all the delegated powers, and reducethe whole to one phrase. Therefore it is, that the constitutionhas restrained congress to the necessary means;that is to say, to those means, without which the grant ofAhr. 55434 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.the power would he nugatory, A little difference in thedegree of convenience cannot constitute the necessity,which the constitution refers to.^ 605. The effect of this mode of interpretation isto exclude all choice of means ; or, at most, to leave tocongress in each case those only, which are most directand simple. If, indeed, such implied powers, and suchonly, as can be shown to be indispensably necessary, arewithin the purview of the clause, there will be no end todifficulties, and the express powers must practically becomea mere nullity. It will be found, that the operationsof the government, upon any of its powers, willrarely admit of a rigid demonstration of the necessity(in this strict sense) of any particular means. In mostcases, various systems or means may be resorted totoattain the same end ; and yet, with respect to each,it may be argued, that it is not constitutional, becauseit is not indispensable ; and the end may be obtainedby other means. The consequence of such reasoningwould be, that, as no means could be shown to be constitutional,none could be adopted. Fdr instance, congresspossess the power to make war, and to raise armies,and incidentally to erect fortifications, and purchasecannon and ammunition and other munitions of war.But war may be carried on without fortifications, cannon,and ammunition. No particular kind of arms canbe shown to be absolutely necessary ; because varioussorts of arms of different convenience, power, and utilityare, or may be resorted to by different nations.What then becomes of the power? Congress haspower to borrow money, and to provide for the paymentof the public debt ; yet no particular method isindispensable to these ends. They may be attained byvarious means. Congress has power to provide a navy ;CH. XXIV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS-incidental. 435but no particular size, or form, or equipment of shipsis indispensable. The means of providing a naval establishmentare very various ; and* the applications ofthem admit of infinite shades of opinion, as to theirconvenience, utility, and necessity. What then is to bedone ? Are the powers to remain dormant 1 Wouldit not be absurd to say, that congress did not possessthe choice of means under such circumstances, andwere not empowered to select, and use any means,which are in fact conducive to the exercise of thepowers granted by the constitution? Take anotherexample ; congress has, doubtless, the authority,under the power to regulate commerce, to erect lighthouses,beacons, buoys, and public piers, and authorizethe employment of pilots. But it cannot be affirmed,that the exercise of these powers is in a strict sensenecessary ; or that the power to regulate commercewould be nugatory without establishments of this nature.In truth, no particular regulation of commercecan ever be shown to be exclusively and indispensablynecessary ; and thus we should be driven to admit, thatall regulations are within the scope of the power, orthat none are. If there be any general principle, whichis inherent in the very definition of government, andessential to every step of the progress to be made bythat of the United States, it is, that every power, vestedin the government, is in its nature sovereign, and includes,by force of the term, a right to employ all themeans requisite, and fairly applicable to the attainmentof the end of such power ; unless they are excepted inthe constitution, or are immoral, or are contrary to theessential objects of political society. *§ 606. There is another difficulty in the strict constructionabove alluded to, that it makes the constituteCONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.national authority depend upon casual and temporary circumstances,which may produce a necessity to-day, andchange it tomorrow'. This alone shows the fallacy ofthe reasoning. The expediency of exercising a particularpower at a particular time must, indeed, depend oncircumstances ; but the constitutional right of exercisingit must be uniform and invariable ; the same to-day, astomorrow.§ 607. Neither can the degree, in which a measureis necessary, ever be a test of the legal right to adoptit. That must be a matter of opinion, (upon whichdifferent men, and different bodies may form oppositejudgments,) and can only be a test of expediency.The relation between the measure and the end, betweenthe nature of the means employed towards theexecution of a power, and the object of that power,must be the criterion of constitutionality ; and not thegreater or less necessity or expediency. If thelegislature possess a right of choice as to the means,who can limit that choice? Who is appointed an umpire,or arbiter in cases, where a discretion is confidedto a government? The very idea of such a controllingauthority in the exercise of its powers is a virtual denialof the supremacy of the government in regard toits powers. It repeals the supremacy of the nationalgovernment, proclaimed in the constitution.§ 608. It is equally certain, that neither the grammatical,nor the popular sense of the word, "necessary,"requires any such construction. According to both,necessary " often means no more than needful, requisite,incidental, useful, or conducive to. It is a commonmode of expression to say, that it is necessary for agovernment, or a person, to do this or that thing, whennothing more is intended or understood, than that theCH. XXIV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS - INCIDENTAL. 437interest of the government or person requires, or willbe promoted by, the doing of this or that thing. Everyone'smind will at once suggest to him many illustrationsof the use of the word in this sense. To employthe means, necessary to an end, is generally understood,as employing any means calculated to producethe end, and not as being confined to those meansalone, without which the end would be entirely unattainable.§ 609. Such is the character of human language,that no word conveys to the mind, in all situations, onesingle definite idea ; and nothing is more common, thanto use words in a figurative sense. Almost all compositionscontain words, which, taken in their rigoroussense, would convey a meaning, different from that,which is obviously intended. It is essential to just interpretation,that many words, which import somethingexcessive, should be understood in a more mitigatedsense ; in a sense, which common usage justifies. Theword " necessary " is of this description. It has not aa fixed character peculiar to itself. It admits of all degreesof comparison ; and is often connected with otherwords, which increase or diminish the impression, whichthe mind receives of the urgency it imports. A thingmay be necessary, very necessary, absolutely or indispensablynecessary. It may be little necessary, lessnecessary, or least necessary. To no mind would thesame idea be conveyed by any two of these severalphrases. The tenth section of the first article of theconstitution furnishes a strong illustration of this veryuse of the word. It contains a prohibition upon anystate to " lay any imposts or duties, &c. except whatmay be absolutely necessary for executing its inspectionlaws." No one can, compare this clause with the438 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.Other, on which we are commenting, without beingstruck with the conviction, that the word " absolutely, ^^here prefixed to " necessary," is intended to distinguishit from the sense, in which, standing alone, it isused in the other.§610. That the restrictive interpretation must beabandoned, in regard to certain powers of the government,cannot be reasonably doubted. It is universallyconceded, that the power of punishment appertains tosovereignty, and may be exercised, whenever the sovereignhas a right to act, as incidental to his constitutionalpowers. It is a means for carrying into executionall sovereign powers, and may be used, although not indispensablynecessary. If, then, the restrictive interpretationmust be abandoned, in order to justify theconstitutional exercise of the power to punish; whenceis the rule derived, which would reinstate it, when thegovernment would carry its powers into operation, bymeans not vindictive in their nature ? If the word,necessary " means needful, requisite, essential, conduciveto, to let in the power of punishment, why is it notequally comprehensive, when applied to other meansused to facilitate the execution of the powers of thegovernment ?§ 611. The restrictive interpretation is also contraryto a sound maxim of construction, generallyadmitted, namely, that the powers contained in a constitutionof government, especially those, which concernthe general administration of the affairs of thecountry, such as its finances, its trade, and its defence,ought to be liberally expounded in advancement of thepublic good. This rule does not depend on the particularform of a government, or on the particular demarcationsof the boundaries of its powers ; but on theCH. XXIV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS INCIDENTAL. 439nature and objects of government itself. The means,bj which national exigencies are provided for, nationalinconveniences obviated, and national prosperity promoted,are of such infinite variety, extent, and complexity,that there must of necessity be great latitudeof discretion in the selection, and application of thosemeans. Hence, consequently, result the necessity andpropriety of exercising the authorities, entrusted to agovernment, upon principles of a liberal construction.^612. It is no valid objection to this doctrine tosay, that it is calculated to extend the powers of thegovernment throughout the entire sphere of state legislation.The same thing may be said, and has beensaid, in regard to every exercise of power by implicationand construction. There is always some chanceof error, or abuse of every power ; but this furnishesno ground of objection against the power ; and certainlyno reason for an adherence to the most rigidconstruction of its terms, which would at once arrestthe whole movements of the government. The remedyfor any abuse, or misconstruction of the power,is the same, as in similar abuses and misconstructionsof the state governments. It is by an appeal to theother departments of the government ; and finally tothe people, in the exercise of their elective franchises.§ 613. There are yet other grounds against the restrictiveinterpretation derived from the language, andthe character of the provision. The language is, thatcongress shall have power '' to make all laws, whichshall be necessary and proper If the word " necessary" were used in the strict and rigorous sensecontended for, it would be an extraordinary departurefrom the usual course of the human mind, as exhibitedin solemn instruments, to add another word '' proper ;"440 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.the only possible effect of which is to qualify that strictand rigorous meaning, and to present clearly the ideaof a choice of means in the course of legislation. Ifno means can be resorted to, but such as are indispensablynecessary, there can be neither sense, nor utilityin adding the other word ; for the necessity shuts outfrom view all consideration of the propriety of themeans, as contradistinguished from the former. Butif the intention was to use the word " necessary " inits more liberal sense, then there is a peculiar fitnessin the other word. It has a sense at once admonitory,and directory. It requires, that the means should' be,honte fide appropriate to the end.§ 614. The character of the clause equally forbidsany presumption of an intention to use the restrictiveinterpretation. In the first place the clause is placedamong the powers of congress, and not among thelimitations ripon those powers. In the next place, itsterms purport to enlarge, and not to diminish, thepowers vested in the government. It purports, on itsface, to be an additional power, not a restriction onthose already granted. If it does not, in fact, (asseems the true construction,) give any new powers, itaffirms the right to use all necessary and proper meansto carry into execution the other powers ; and thusmakes an express power, what would otherwise bemerely an implied power. In either aspect, it is impossibleto construe it to be a restriction. If it haveany effect, it is to remove the implication of any restriction.If a restriction had been intended, it is impossible,that the framers of the constitution shouldhave concealed it under phraseology, which purportsto enlarge, or at least give the most ample scope tothe other powers. There was every motive on theirCH. XXIV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS INCIDENTAL. 441part to give point and clearness to every restriction ofnational power ; for they well knew, that the nationalgovernment would be more endangered in its adoptionby its supposed strength, than by its weakness. It isinconceivable, that they should have disguised a restrictionupon its powers under the form of a grant ofpower. They would have sought other terms, andhave imposed the restraint by negatives. And whatis equally strong, no one, in or out of the state conventions,at the time when the constitution was putupon its deliverance before the people, ever dreamedof, or suggested, that this clause contained a restrictionof power. The whole argument on each side, of attackand of defence, gave it the positive form of an expresspower, and not of an express restriction.^ 616. Upon the whole, the result of the mostcareful examination of this clause is, that, if it doesnot enlarge, it cannot be construed to restrain, thepowers of congress, or to impair the right of the legislatureto exercise its best judgment in the selectionof measures to carry into execution the constitutionalpowers of the national government. The motive forits insertion doubtless was, the desire to remove allpossible doubt respecting the right to legislate on thatvast mass of incidental powers, which must be involvedin the constitution, if that instrument be not a splendidpageant, or a delusive phantom of sovereignty. Letthe end be legitimate ; let it be within the scope ofthe constitution ; and all means, which are appropriate,which are plainly adapted to the end, and whichare not prohibited, but are consistent with the letterand spirit of the instrument, are constitutional.^ 616. It may be well, in this connexion, to mentionanother sort of implied power, which has beenAbr. 56442 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.called with great propriety a resulting power, arisingfrom the aggregate powers of the national government.It will not be doubted, for instance, that, if the UnitedStates should make a conquest of any of the territoriesof its neighbours, the national government would possesssovereign jurisdiction over the conquered territory.This would, perhaps, rather be a result Iron the wholemass of the powers of the national government, andfrom the nature of political society, than a consequenceor incident of the powers specially enumerated. Itmay, however, be deemed, if an incident to any, anincident to the power to make war. Other instancesof resulting powers will easily suggest themselves.The United States are no where declared in the constitutionto be a sovereignty entitled to sue, thoughjurisdiction is given to the national courts over controversies," to which the United States shall be a party."It is a natural incident, resulting from the sovereigntyand character of the national government. So theUnited States, in their political capacity, have a rightto enter into a contract, (although it is not expresslyprovided for by the constitution ;) for it is an incidentto their general right of sovereignty, so far as it is appropriateto any of the ends of the government, andwithin the constitutional range of its powers. Socongress possess power to punish offences committedon board of the public ships of war of the governmentby persons not in the military or naval service of theUnited States, whether they are in port, or at sea ;for the jurisdiction on board of public ships is everywheredeemed exclusively to belong to the sovereign.^617. And not only may implied powers, but impliedexemptions from state authority, exist, althoughnot expressly provided for by law. The collectors ofCH. XXIV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS INCIDENTAL. 443the revenue, the carriers of the mail, the mint establishment,and all those institutions, which are publicin their nature, are examples in point. It has neverbeen doubted, that all, who are employed in them,are protected, while in the line of their duty, fromstale control ; and yet this protection is not expressedin any act of congress. It is incidental to, and is impliedin, the several acts, by which those institutionsare created ; and is preserved to them by the judicialdepartment, as a part of its functions. A contractorfor supplying a military post with provisions cannotbe restrained from making purchases within a state,or from transporting provisions to the place, at whichtroops are stationed. He cannot be taxed, or finedor lawfully obstructed, in so doing. These incidentsnecessarily flow from the supremacy of the powers ofthe Union, within their legitimate sphere of action.^ 618. It would be almost impracticable, if it werenot useless, to enumerate the various instances, inwhich congress, in the progress of the government,have made use of incidental and implied means to executeits powers. They are almost infinitely variedin their ramifications and details. It is proposed,however, to take notice of the principal measures,which have been contested, as not within the scopeof the powers of congress, and which may be distinctlytraced in the operations of the government, and inleading party divisions.444 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.CHAPTER XXV.INCIDENTAL POWERS NATIONAL BANK.^ 619. One of the earliest and most importantmeasures, which gave rise to a question of constitutionalpower, was the act chartering the bank of theUnited States in 1791. That question has often sincebeen discussed ; and though the measure has beenrepeatedly sanctioned by congress, by the executive,and by the judiciary, and has obtained the like favourin a great majority of the states, yet it is, up to thisvery hour, still debated upon constitutional grounds,as if it were still new, and untried. It is impossible,at this time, to treat it, as an open question, unlessthe constitution is for ever to remain an unsettled text,possessing no permanent attributes, and incapable ofhaving any ascertained sense ; varying with everychange of doctrine, and of party ; and delivered overto interminable doubts. If the constitution is to beonly, what the administration of the day may wish itto be ; and is to assume any, and all shapes, whichmay suit the opinions and theories of public men, asthey successively direct the public councils, it will bedifficult, indeed, to ascertain, what its real value is.It cannot possess either certainty, or uniformity, orsafety. It will be one thing to-day, and another thingtomorrow, and again another thing on each succeedingday. The past will furnish no guide, and thefuture no security. It will be the reverse of a law ;and entail upon the country the curse of that miserableservitude, so much abhorred and denounced, where allisvague and uncertain in the fundamentals of government.CH. XXV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS BANK. 445^ 620. The reasoning, upon which the constitutionalityof a national bank is denied, has been already insome degree stated in the preceding remarks. It turnsupon the strict interpretation of the clause, giving theauxiliary powers, necessary and proper to execute theother enumerated powers. It is to the followingeffect. The power to incorporate a bank is not amongthose enumerated in the constitution. In the nextplace, all the enumerated powers can be carried intoexecution without a bank. A bank, therefore, is notnecessary and consequently not authorized by thisclause of the constitution. It is urged, that a bankwill give great facility, or convenience to the collectionof taxes. If this were true, yet the constitutionallows only the means, which are necessary and notmerely those, which are convenient, for effecting theenumerated powers. If such a latitude of constructionwere allowed, as to consider convenience, as justifyingthe use of such means, it would swallow up all theenumerated powers. Therefore, the constitution restrainscongress to those means, without which thepower would be nugatory.^ 621. Nor can the convenience be satisfactorilyestablished. Bank-bills may be a more convenientvehicle, than treasury orders, for the purposes of thatdepartment. But a little difference in the degree ofconvenience cannot constitute the necessity contemplatedby the constitution. Besides ; the local andstate banks now in existence are competent, andwould be willing to undertake all the agency requiredfor those very purposes by the government. And ifthey are able and willing, this establishes clearly, thatthere can be no necessity for establishing a nationalbank. If there shall ever be a superior conveniencyCONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.in a national bank, it does not follow, that there existsa power to establish it, or that the business of thecountry cannot go on very well without it. Can itbe thought, that the constitution intended, that for ashade or two of convenience, more or less, congressshould be authorized to break down the most ancientand fundamental laws of the states, such as thoseagainst mortmain, the laws of alienage, the rules ofdescent, the acts of distribution, the laws of escheatand forfeiture, and the laws of monopoly ? Nothingbut a necessity, invincible by any other means, canjustify such a prostration of laws, which constitutethe pillars of our whole system of jurisprudence. Ifcongress have the power to create one corporation,they may create all sorts ; for the power is no wherelimited ; and they may even establish monopolies.Indeed this very charter is a monopoly.§ 622. The reasoning, by which the constitutionalityof the national bank has been sustained, is containedin the following summary. The powers confidedto the national government are unquestionably,so far as they exist, sovereign and supreme. It isnot, and cannot be disputed, that the power of creatinga corporation is one belonging to sovereignty.But so are all other legislative powers ; for the originalpower of giving the law on any subject whateveris a sovereign power. If the national governmentcannot create a corporation, because it is an exerciseof sovereign power, neither can it, for the same reason,exercise any other legislative power. This considerationalone ought to put an end to the abstract inquiry,whether the national government has power to erectacorporation, that is, to give a legal or artificial capacityto one or more persons, distinct from the watch.XXV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS — BANK. 447ural capacity. For, if it be an incident to sovereignty,and it is not prohibited, it must belong to the nationalgovernment in relation to the objects entrustedto it. The true difference is this ; where the authorityof a government is general, it can create corporationsin all cases ; where it is confined to certain branchesof legislation, it can create corporations only as tothose cases. It cannot be denied, that implied powersmay be delegated, as well as express. It follows,that a power to erect corporations may as well beimplied, as any other thing, if it be an instrument ormeans of carrying into execution any specified power.The only question in any case must be, whether it besuch an instrument or means, and have a natural relationto any of the acknowledged objects of government.Thus, congress may not erect a corporationfor superintending the police of the city of Philadelphia,because they have no authority to regulate thepolice of that city. But if they possessed the authorityto regulate the police of that city, they might,unquestionably, create a corporation for that purpose ;because it is incident to the sovereign legislativepower to regulate a thing, to employ all the means,which relate to its regulation, to the best and greatestadvantage.§ 623, A strange fallacy has crept into the reasoningon this subject. It has been supposed, that a corporationis some great, independent thing ; and thatthe power to erect it is a great, substantive, independentpoAver ; whereas, in truth, a corporation is but alegal capacity, quality, or means, to an end ; and thepower to erect it is, or may be, an implied and incidentalpower. A corporation is never the end, forwhich other powers are exercised ; but a means, by448 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.which other objects are accomplished. No contributionsare made to charity for the sake of an incorporation; but a corporation is created to administer thecharity. No seminary of learning is instituted inorder to be incorporated ; but the corporate characteris conferred to subserve the purposes of education.No city was ever built with the sole object of beingincorporated ; but it is incorporated, as affording thebest means of being well governed. So a mercantilecompany is formed with a certain capital for carryingon a particular branch of business. Here, the businessto be prosecuted is the end. The association, in orderto form the requisite capital, is the primary means.If an incorporation is added to the association, it onlygives it a new quality, an artificial capacity, by whichit is enabled to prosecute the business with more convenienceand safety. In truth, the power of creatinga corporation is never used for its own sake ; but forthe purpose of effecting something else. So that thereis not a shadow of reason to say. that it may not passasan incident to powers expressly given, and as amode of executing them.^ 624. It is true, that among the enumerated powerswe do not find that of establishing a bank, or creatinga corporation. But we do find there the greatpowers to lay and collect taxes ; to borrow money ; toregulate commerce ; to declare and conduct war ; andto raise and support armies and navies. Now, if abank be a fit means to execute any or all of thesepowers, it is just as much implied, as any other means.If it be " necessary and proper" for any of them, howis it possible to deny the authority to create it for suchpurposes ? There is no more propriety in giving thispower in express terms, than in giving any other inci-CH. XXV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS BANK. 449dental powers or means in express terms. If it hadbeen intended to grant this power generally, and tomake it a distinct and independent power, having norelation to, but reaching beyond the other enumeratedpowers, there would then have been a propriety ingiving it in express terms, for otherwise it would notexist. Thus, it was proposed in the convention, togive a general power " to grant charters of incorporation;" — to " grant charters of incorporation in cases,where the public good may require them, and theauthority of a single state maybe incompetent ;" —and ^' to grant letters of incorporation for canals, &c."If either of these propositions had been adopted, therewould have been an obvious propriety in giving thepower in express terms ; because, as to the two former,the power was general and unlimited, and reachingfar beyond any of the other enumerated powers ;and as to the latter, it might be far more extensivethan any incident to the other enumerated powers.But the rejection of these propositions does not prove,that congress in no case, as an incident to the enumeratedpowers, could erect a corporation ; but only,that they should not have a substantive, independentpower to erect corporations beyond those powers.§ 625. Indeed, it is most manifest, that it nevercould have been contemplated by the convention, thatcongress should, in no case, possess the power to erectacorporation. What otherwise would become of theterritorial governments, all of which are corporations,created by congress ? There is no where an expresspower given to congress to erect them. But underthe confederation, congress did provide for their erection,as a resulting and implied right of sovereignty,by the celebrated ordinance of 1787 ; and congress,Ahi 57450 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.under the constitution, have ever since, without question,and with the universal approbation of the nation,from time to time created territorial governments.Yet congress derive this power by implication, asnecessary and proper to carry into effect the expresspower to regulate the territories of the United States.In the convention, two propositions were made, andreferred to a committee at the same time with thepropositions already stated respecting granting ofcharters, " to dispose of the unappropriated lands ofthe United States," and " to institute temporary governmentsfor new states arising therein." Both of thesepropositions shared the same fate, as those respectingcharters of incorporation. But what would be thoughtof the argument, built upon this foundation, that congressdid not possess the power to erect territorialgovernments, because these propositions were silentlyabandoned, or annulled in the convention.^ 626. This is not the only case, in which congressmay erect corporations. Under the power to acceptacession of territory for the seat of government, andto exercise exclusive legislation therein, no one candoubt, that congress may erect corporations therein ;not only public, but private corporations. They haveconstantly exercised the power ; and it has never yetbeen breathed, that it was unconstitutional. Yet itcan be exercised only as an incident to the power ofgeneral legislation. And if so, why may it not beexercised, as an incident to any specific power of legislation,if it be a means to attain the objects of suchpower ?^ 627. That a national bank is an appropriate meansto carry into effect some of the enumerated powers ofthe government, and that this can be best done byCH. XXV.] POWERS OF CONGRESS BANK. 451erecting it into a corporation, may be established bythe most satisfactory reasoning. It has a relation,more or less direct, to the power of collecting taxes,to that of borrowing money, to that of regulating tradebetween the states, and to those of raising and maintainingfleets and armies. And it may be added, thatit has a most important bearing upon the regulationof currency between the states. It is an instrument,which has been usually applied by governments in theadministration of their fiscal and financial operations.And in the present times it can hardly require argumentto prove, that it is a convenient, a useful, andan essential instrument in the fiscal operations of thegovernment of the United States. This is so generallyadmitted by sound and intelligent statesmen,that it would be a waste of time to endeavour toestablish the truth by an elaborate survey of the mode,in which it touches the administration of all the variousbranches of the powers of the government.^ 628. In regard to the faculties of the bank, ifcongress could constitutionally create it, they mightconfer on it such faculties and powers, as were fit tomake it an appropriate means for fiscal operations.They had a right to adapt it in the best manner to itsend. No one can pretend, that its having the facultyof holding a capital ; of lending and dealing in money ;of issuing bank notes ; of receiving deposits ; and ofappointing suitable officers to manage its affairs ; arenot highly useful and expedient, and appropriate tothe purposes of a bank. They are just such, as areusually granted to state banks ; and just such, as giveincreased facilities to all its operations. To say,that the bank might have gone on without this or thatfaculty, is nothing. Who, but congress, shall say, how452 CONSTITUTION Of THE U. STATES. [boOK III.few, or how many faculties it shall have, if all are stillappropriate to it, as an instrument of government, andmay make it more convenient, and more useful in itsoperations ? No man can say, that a single faculty inany national charter is useless, or irrelevant, or strictlyimproper, that is conducive to its end, as a nationalinstrument. Deprive a bank of its trade and business,and its vital principles are destroyed. Its form mayremain, but its substance is gone. All the powersgiven to the bank are to give efficacy to its functionsof trade and business.^ 629. As to another suggestion, that the same objectsmight have been accomplished through the statebanks, it is sufficient to say, that no trace can be foundin the constitution of any intention to create a dependenceon the states, or state institutions, for the executionof its great powers. Its own means are adequateto its end ; and on those means it was expected torely for their accomplishment. It would be utterlyabsurd to make the powers of the constitution whollydependent on state institutions. But, if state banksmight be employed, as congress have a choice ofmeans, they have a right to choose a national bank, inpreference to state banks, for the financial operationsof the government. Proof, that they might use onemeans, is no proof, that they cannot constitutionallyuse another means.^ 630. After all, the subject has been settled repeatedlyby every department of the government, legislative,executive, and judicial. The states have acquiesced; and a majority have constantly sustainedthe power. If it is not now settled, it never can be.If it is settled, it would be too much to expect a re-argument,whenever any person may choose to questionit.CH. XXVI.] POWERS OF CONGRESS ROADS, &C. 453CHAPTER XXVI.POWERS OF CONGRESS INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS.^ 631. Another question, which has for a longtimeagitated the public councils of the nation, is, asto the authority of congress to make roads, canals,and other internal improvements.^ 632. So far, as regards the right to appropriatemoney to internal improvements generally, the subjecthas already passed under review in considering thepower to lay and collect taxes. The doctrine therecontended for, which has been in a great measureborne out by the actual practice of the government,is, that congress may appropriate money, not only toclear obstructions to navigable rivers ; to improveharbours ; to build breakwaters ; to assist navigation ;to erect forts, light-houses, and piers ; and to otherpurposes allied to some of the enumerated powers ;but may also appropriate it in aid of canals, roads,and other institutions of a similar nature, existingunder state authority. The only limitations upon thepower are those prescribed by the terms of the constitution,that the objects shall be for the commondefence, or the general welfare of the Union. Thetrue test is, whether the object be of a local character,and local use ; or, whether it be of general benefit tothe states. If it be purely local, congress cannotconstitutionally appropriate money for the object.But, if the benefit be general, it matters not, whetherin point of locality it be in one state, or several ;whether it be of large, or of small extent. Its natureand character determine the right, and congress may454 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.appropriate money in aid of it ; for it is then in a justsense for the general welfare.§ 633. But it has been contended, that the constitutionis not confined to mere appropriations of money ;but authorizes congress directly to undertake, and carryon a system of internal improvements for the generalwelfare, wherever such improvements fall within thescope of any of the enumerated powers. Congressmay not, indeed, engage in such undertakings merely,because they are internal improvements for the generalwelfare, unless they fall within the scope of the enumeratedpowers. The distinction between this power,and the power of appropriation is, that in the latter,congress may appropriate to any purpose, which is forthe common defence or general welfare ; but in theformer, they can engage in such undertakings only,as are means, or incidents to its enumerated powers.Congress may, therefore, authorize the making of acanal, as incident to the power to regulate commerce,where such canal may facilitate the intercourse betweenstate and state. They may authorize light-houses,piers, buoys, and beacons to be built for the purposesof navigation. They may authorize the purchase andbuilding of custom-houses, and revenue cutters, andpublic ware-houses, as incidents to the power to layand collect taxes. They may purchase places forpublic uses ; and erect forts, arsenals, dock-yards,navy-yards, and magazines, as incidents to the powerto make war.^ 634. For the same reason congress may authorizethe laying out and making of a military road, andacquire a right over the soil for such purposes ; and asincident thereto they will have a power to keep the roadin repair, and prevent all obstructions thereto. ButCH. XXVI.] POWERS OF CONGRESS ROADS, &C. 455in these, and the like cases, the general jurisdiction ofthe state over the soil, subject only to the rights of theUnited States, is not excluded. As, for example, incaseof a military road ; although a state cannot preventrepairs on the part of the United States, or authorizeany obstructions of the road, its general jurisdictionremains untouched. It may punish all crimescommitted on the road ; and it retains in other respectsits territorial sovereignty over it. The right of soilmay still remain in the state, or in individuals, and theright to the easement only in the national government.There is a great distinction between the exercise of apower, excluding altogether state jurisdiction, and theexercise of a power, which leaves the state jurisdictiongenerally in force, and yet includes, on the part of thenational government, a power to preserve, what it hascreated.§ 635. In all these, and other cases, in which thepower of congress is asserted, it is so upon the generalground of its being an incidental power ; and the courseof reasoning, by which it is supported, is precisely thesame, as that adopted in relation to other cases alreadyconsidered. It is, for instance, admitted, that congresscannot authorize the making of a canal, except forsome purpose of commerce among the states, or forsome other purpose belonging to the Union ; and itcannot make a military road, unless it be necessaryand proper for purposes of war. To go over thereasoning at large would, therefore, be little more,than a repetition of what has been already fully expounded.The Journal of the Convention is not supposedto furnish any additional lights on the subject,beyond what have been already stated.^ 636, The resistance to this extended reach of456 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.the national powers turns also upon the same generalreasoning, by which a strict construction of the constitutionhas been constantly maintained. It is said,that such a power is not among those enumerated inthe constitution ; nor is it implied, as a means of executingany of them. The power to regulate commercecannot include a power to construct roads andcanals, and improve the navigation of water-coursesin order to facilitate, promote, and secure such commerce,without a latitude of construction departingfrom the ordinary import of the terms, and incompatiblewith the nature of the constitution. The liberalinterpretation has been very uniformly asserted bycongress ; the strict interpretation has not uniformly,but has upon several important occasions been insistedupon by the executive. In the present state of thecontroversy, the duty of forbearance seems inculcatedupon the commentator ; and the reader must decidefor himself upon his own views of the subject.^ 637. Another question has been made, how farcongress could make a law giving to the United Statesa preference and priority of payment of their debts, incaseof the death, or insolvency, or bankruptcy of theirdebtors, out of their estates. It has been settled, upondeliberate argument, that congress possess such aconstitutional power. It is a necessary and properpower to carry into effect the other powers of the government.The government is to pay the debts of theUnion ; and must be authorized to use the means,which appear to itself most eligible to effect that object.It may purchase, and remit bills for this object ; andit may take all those precautions, and make all thoseregulations, which will render the transmission safe.It may, in like manner, pass all laws to render effectualCH. XXVI.] POWERS OF CONGRESS ROADS, &C. 457the collection of its debts. It is no objection to thisright of priority, that it will interfere with the rightsof the state sovereignties respecting the dignity ofdebts, and will defeat the measures, which they havea right to adopt to secure themselves against delinquencieson the part of their own revenue or otherofficers. This objection, if of any avail, is an objectionto the powers given by the constitution. The mischiefsuggested, so far as it can really happen, is the necessaryconsequence of the supremacy of the laws of theUnited States on all subjects, to which the legislativepower of congress extends.§ 638. It is under the same implied authority, thatthe United States have any right even to sue in theirown courts ; for an express power is no where givenin the constitution, though it is clearly implied in thatpart respecting the judicial power. And congress maynot only authorize suits to be brought in the name ofthe United States, but in the name of any artificialperson, (such as the Postmaster-general,) or naturalperson, for their benefit. Indeed, all the usual incidentsappertaining to a personal sovereign, in relationto contracts, and suing, and enforcing rights, so far asthey are within the scope of the powers of the government,belong to the United States, as they do toother sovereigns. The right of making contracts andinstituting suits is an incident to the general right ofsovereignty ; and the United States, being a bodypolitic, may, within the sphere of the constitutionalpowers confided to it, and through the instrumentalityof the proper department, to which those powers areconfided, enter into contracts not prohibited by law,and appropriate to the just exercise of those powers ;Abr. 58458 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.and enforce the observance of them by suits and judicialprocess.^ 639. There are almost innumerable cases, inwhich the auxiliary and implied powers belonging tocongress have been put into operation. But the objectof these Commentaries is, rather to take notice ofthose, which have been the subject of animadversion,than of those, which have hitherto escaped reproof, orhave been silently approved.CH. XXVII.] POWERS OF CONGRESS LOUISIANA. 459CHAPTER XXVII.POWERS OF CONGRESS PURCHASE OF FOREIGNTERRITORY EMBARGOES.^ 640. But the most remarkable powers, whichhave been exercised by the government, as auxiliaryand implied powers, and which, if any, go to the utmostverge of liberal construction, are the laying of anunlimited embargo in 1807, and the purchase of Louisianain 1803, and its subsequent admission into theUnion, as a state. These measures were brought forward,and supported, and carried, by the known andavowed friends of a strict construction of the constitution; and they were justified at the time, and can benow justified, only upon the doctrines of those, whosupport a liberal construction of the constitution.The subject has been already hinted at ; but it deservesa more deliberate review.^ 641. In regard to the acquisition of Louisiana : —The treaty of 1 803 contains a cession of the whole ofthat vast territory by France to the United States, forasum exceeding eleven millions of dollars. There isa stipulation in the treaty on the part of the UnitedStates, that the inhabitants of the ceded territory shallbe incorporated into the Union, and admitted, as soonas possible, according to the principles of the federalconstitution, to the enjoyment of all the rights, advantages,and immunities of citizens of the United States.^ 642. It is obvious, that the treaty embraced severalvery important questions, each of them upon thegrounds of a strict construction full of difficulty anddelicacy. In tht first place, had the United States a460 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.constitutional authority to accept the cession and payfor it ? In the next place, if they had, was the stipulationfor the admission of the inhabitants into theUnion, as a state, constitutional, or within the powerof congress to give it effect ?^ 643. There is no pretence, that the purchase, orcession of any foreign territory is within any of thepowers expressly enumerated in the constitution. Itis no where in that instrument said, that congress, orany other department of the national government, shallhave a right to purchase, or accept of any cession offoreign territory. The power itself (it has been said)could scarcely have been in the contemplation of theframers of it. It is, in its own nature, as dangerous toliberty, as susceptible of abuse in its actual application,and as likely as any, which could be imagined, to leadto a dissolution of the Union. If congress have thepower, it may unite any foreign territory whatsoeverto our own, however distant, however populous, andhowever powerful. Under the form of a cession, wemay become united to a more powerful neighbour orrival ; and be involved in European, or other foreigninterests, and contests, to an interminable extent.And if there may be a stipulation for the admission otforeign states into the Union, the whole balance ofthe constitution may be destroyed, and the old statessunk into utter insignificance. It is incredible, thatit should have been contemplated, that any such overwhelmingauthority should be confided to the nationalgovernment w with the consent of the people of the oldstates. If it exists at all, it is unforeseen, and theresult of a sovereignty, intended to be limited, andyet not sufficiently guarded. The very case of thecession of Louisiana is a striking illustration of theCH. XXVII.] POWERS OF CONGRESS LOUISIANA. 461doctrine. It admits, by consequence, into the Unionan immense territory, equal to, if not greater, thanthat of all the United States under the peace of 1783.In the natural progress of events, it must, within ashort period, change the whole balance of power inthe Union, and transfer to the West all the importantattributes of the sovereignty of the whole. If, as iswell known, one of the strong objections urged againstthe constitution was, that the original territory of theUnited States was too large for a national government ;it is inconceivable, that it could have been within theintention of the people, that any additions of foreignterritory should be made, which should thus doubleevery danger from this source. The treaty-makingpower must be construed, as confined to objects withinthe scope of the constitution. And, although congresshave authority to admit new states into the firm, yetit is demonstrable, that this clause had sole referenceto the territory then belonging to the United States ;and was designed for the admission of the states, which,under the ordinance of 1787, were contemplated to beformed within its old boundaries. In regard to theappropriation of money for the purposes of the cessionthe case is still stronger. If no appropriation of moneycan be made, except for cases within the enumeratedpowers, (and this clearly is not one,) how can theenormous sum of eleven millions be justified for thisobject ? If it be said, that it will be " for the commondefence, and general welfare " to purchase theterritory, how is this reconcilable with the strict constructionof the constitution ? If congress can appropriatemoney for one object, because it is deemed forthe common defence and general welfare, why maythey not appropriate it for all objects of the same sort ?462 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.If the territory can be purchased, it must be governed ;and a territorial government must be created. Butwhere can congress find authority in the constitutionto erect a territorial government, since it does notpossess the power to erect corporations ?^ 644. Such were the objections, which were urgedagainst the cession, and the appropriations made tocarry the treaty into effect. The friends of the measurewere driven to the adoption of the doctrine, thatthe right to acquire territory was incident to nationalsovereignty ; that it was a resulting power, growingnecessarily out of the aggregate powers confided bythe federal constitution ; that the appropriation mightjustly be vindicated upon this ground, and also uponthe ground, that it was for the common defence andgeneral welfare. In short, there is no possibility ofdefending the constitutionality of this measure, butupon the principles of the liberal construction, whichhas been, upon other occasions, so earnestly resisted.§ 645. The other instance of an extraordinary applicationof the implied powers of the government,above alluded to, is the embargo laid in the year 1807,by the special recommendation of President Jefferson.It was avowedly recommended, as a measure of safetyfor our vessels, our seamen, and our merchandise, fromthe then threatening dangers from the belligerents ofEurope ; and it was explicitly stated " to be a measureof precaution called for by the occasion;" and "neitherhostile in its character, nor as justifying, or inciting, orleading to hostility with any nation whatever." It wasin no sense, then, a war measure. If it could beclassed at all, as flowing from, or as an incident to, anyof the enumerated powers, it was to that of regulatingcommerce. In its terms, the act provided, that an .XXVII.] POWERS OF CONGRESS-EMBARGOES. 463barge be, and hereby is, laid on all ships and vessels inthe ports, or within the limits or jurisdiction, of theUnited States, &:c. bound to any foreign port or place.It was in its terms unlimited in duration ; and could beremoved only by a subsequent act of congress, havingthe assent of all the constitutional branches of the legislature.§ 646. No one can reasonably doubt, that the layingof an embargo, suspending commerce for a limitedperiod, is within the scope of the constitution. But thequestion of difficulty was, whether congress, under thepower to regulate commerce with foreign nations, couldconstitutionally suspend and interdict it wholly for anunlimited period, that is, by a permanent act, having nolimitation as to duration, either of the act, or of the embargo.It was most seriously controverted, and itsconstitutionality denied in the Eastern states of theUnion, during its existence. An appeal was made tothe judiciary upon the question; and it having beensettled to be constitutional by that department of thegovernment, the decision was acquiesced in, though themeasure bore with almost unexampled severity uponthe Eastern states; and its ruinous effects can still betraced along their extensive seaboard. The argumentwas, that the power to regulate did not include thepower to annihilate commerce, by interdicting it permanentlyand entirely with foreign nations. The decisionwas, that the power of congress was sovereign, in relationto commercial intercourse, qualified by the limitationsand restrictions contained in the constitution itself.Non-intercourse and Embargo laws are within therange of legislative discretion ; and if congress have thepower, for purposes of safety, of preparation, or of counteraction,to suspend commercial intercourse with CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK HI.reign nations, they are not limited, as to the duration,any more, than as to the manner and extent of themeasure.§ 647. That this measure went to the utmost vergeof constitutional power, and especially of implied power,has never been denied. That it could not be justifiedby any, but the most liberal construction of the constitution,is equally undeniable. It was the favourite measureof those, who were generally the advocates of thestrictest construction. It was sustained by the peoplefrom a belief, that it was promotive of the interests, andimportant to the safety of the Union.^ 648. There remain one or two other measures ofa political nature, whose constitutionality has been denied; but which, being of a transient character, haveleft no permanent traces in the constitutional jurisprudenceof the country. Reference is here made to theAlien and Sedition laws, passed in 1798, both of whichwere limited to a short duration, and expired by theirown limitation.§ 649. The constitutionality of both the acts wasassailed with great earnestness and ability at the time ;and was defended with equal masculine vigour. Theground of the advocates, in favour of these laws, was,that they resulted from the right and duty in the governmentof self-preservation, and the like duty andprotection of its functionaries in the proper dischargeof their official duties. They were impugned, as notconformable to the letter, or spirit of the constitution ;and as inconsistent in their principles with the rights ofcitizens, and the liberty of the press. The When actwas denounced, as exercising a power not delegatedby the constitution ; as uniting legislative and judicialfunctions, with that of the executive ; and by this UnionCH. XXVII.] POWERS OF CONGRESS-ALIEN ACT. 465as subverting the general principles of free government,and the particular organization and positive provisionsof the constitution. It was added, that the Seditionact was open to the same objection, and was expresslyforbidden by one of the amendments of theconstitution, on which there will be occasion hereafterto comment. At present it does not seem necessary topresent more than this general outline, as the measuresare not likely to be renewed ; and as the doctrines, onwhich they are maintained, and denounced, are not materiallydifferent from those, which have been alreadyconsidered.Abr. 59466 CONSTITUTION OF THE F. STATES. [bOOK III.CHAPTER XXVIII.POWER OF CONGRESS TO PUNISH TREASON.§ 650. And here, in the order of the constitution,terminates the section, which enumerates the powersof Congress. There are, however, other clauses detachedfrom their proper connexion, which embraceother powers delegated to congress ; and which for noapparent reason have been so detached. As it will bemore convenient to bring the whole in review at once,it is proposed (though it is a deviation from the generalmethod of this work) to submit them in this place tothe consideration of the reader.^651. The third section of the fourth article gives aconstitutional definition of the crime of treason, (whichwill be reserved for a separate examination,) and thenprovides : " The congress shall have power to declarethe punishment of treason ; but no attainder of treasonshall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture, exceptduring the Hfe of the person attainted."^ 652. The propriety of investing the national governmentwith authority to punish the crime of treasonagainst the United States could never become a questionwith any persons, who deemed the national governmentworthy of creation, or preservation. If the powerhad not been expressly granted, it must have been implied,unless all the powers of the national governmentmight be put at defiance, and prostrated with impunity.Two motives, probably, concurred in introducing it, asan express power. One was, not to leave it open to implication,whether treason was to be exclusively punish.XXVIII.] POWERS OF CONGRESS TREASON. 467able with death according to the known rule of thecommon law, and with the barbarous accompanimentspointed out by it ; but to confide the punishment to thediscretion of congress. The other was, to impose somelimitation upon the nature and extent of the punishment,so that it should not work corruption of blood orforfeiture beyond the life of the offender.§ 653. The punishment of high treason by the commonlaw, as stated by Mr. Justice Blackstone, is as follows:1. That the offender be drawn to the gallows,and not be carried or walk, though usually (by connivanceat length ripened into law) a sledge or hurdle isallowed, to preserve the offender from the extremetorment of being dragged on the ground or pavement.2. That he be hanged by the neck, and cut down alive.3. That his entrails be taken out and burned, while heis yet alive. 4. That his head be cut off. 5. Thathis body be divided into four parts. 6. That his headand quarters be at the king's disposal. These refinementsin cruelty (which if now practised would be disgracefulto the character of the age) were, in formertimes, Literally and studiously executed ; and indicateat once a savage and ferocious spirit, and a degradingsubserviency to royal resentments, real or supposed.It was wise to place the punishment solely in the discretionof congress ; and the punishment has been sincedeclared to be simply death by hanging ; thus inflictingdeath in a manner becoming the humanity of a civilizedsociety.^ 654. It is well known, that corruption of blood,and forfeiture of the estate of the offender followed, asanecessary consequence at the common law, uponevery attainder of treason. By corruption of blood allinheritable qualities are destroyed ; so, that an attaintedCONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.ed person can neither inherit lands, nor other hereditaryfrom his ancestors, nor retain those, he is alreadyin possession of, nor transmit them to any heir. And thisdestruction of all inheritable qualities is so complete,that it obstructs all descents to his posterity, wheneverthey are obliged to derive a title through him to anyestate of a remoter ancestor. So, that if a father commitstreason, and is attainted, and suffers death, andthen the grandfather dies, his grandson cannot inheritany estate from his grandfather ; for he must claimthrough his father, who can convey to him no inheritableblood. Thus the innocent are made the victimsof a guilt, in which they did not, and perhaps could not,participate ; and the sin is visited upon remote generations.In addition to this most grievous disability theperson attainted forfeits, by the common law, all hislands, and tenements, and rights of entry, and rights ofprofits in lands or tenements, which he possesses.And this forfeiture relates back to the time of the treasoncommitted, so as to avoid all intermediate sales andincumbrances ; and he also forfeits all his goods andchattels from the time of his conviction.§ 655. The reason commonly assigned for these severepunishments, beyond the mere forfeiture of thelife of the party attainted, are these : By committingtreason the party has broken his original bond of allegiance,and forfeited his social rights. Among thesesocial rights, that of transmitting property to others isdeemed one of the chief and most valuable. Moreover,such forfeitures, whereby the posterity of theoffender must suffer, as well as himself, will help to restraina man, not only by the sense of his duty, anddread of personal punishment, but also by his passionsand natural affections ; and will interest every depends.XXVIII.] POWERS OF CONGRESS TREASON. 469went and relation, he has, to keep him from offending.But this view of the subject is wholly unsatisfactory.It looks only to the offender himself, and is regardlessof his innocent posterity. It really operates, as a posthumouspunishment upon them ; and compels them tobear, not only the disgrace naturally attendant uponsuch flagitious crimes ; but takes from them the commonrights and privileges enjoyed by all other citizens,where they are wholly innocent, and however remotethey may be in the lineage from the first offender. Itsurely is enough for society to take the life of theoffender, as a just punishment of his crime, withouttaking from his offspring and relatives that property,which may be the only means of saving them from povertyand ruin. It is bad policy too ; for it cuts off allthe attachments, which these unfortunate victims mightotherwise feel for their own government, and preparesthem to engage in any other service, by which theirsupposed injuries may be redressed, or their hereditaryhatred gratified. Upon these and similar grounds, itmay be presumed, that the clause was first introducedinto the original draft of the constitution ; and, aftersome amendments, it was adopted without any apparentresistance.i470 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.CHAPTER XXIX.POWER OF CONGRESS AS TO PROOF OF STATERECORDS AND PROCEEDINGS.^ 656. The first section of the fourth article declares: " Full faith and credit shall be given in eachstate to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedingsof every other state. And the congress may by"general lavish prescribe the manner, in which suchacts, records, and proceedings shall be proved, and the'' effect thereof r^ 657. It is well known, that the laws and acts offoreign nations are not judicially taken notice of in anyother nation ; and that they must be proved, like anyother facts, whenever they come into operation or examinationin any forensic controversy. The natureand mode of the proof depend upon the municipallaw of the country, where the suit is depending ; andthere are known to be great diversities in the practiceof different nations on this subject. Even in Englandand America the subject, notwithstanding the numerousjudicial decisions, which have from time to time beenmade, is not without its difficulties and embarrassments.^ 658. Independent of the question as to proof, thereis another question, as to the effect, which is to be givento foreign judgments, when duly authenticated, inthe tribunals of other nations, either as matter to maintaina suit, or to found a defence to a suit. Upon thissubject, also, different nations are not entirely agreedin opinion or practice. Most, if not all of them, professCH. XXIX.] POWERS OF CONGRESS RECORDS. 471to give some effect to such judgments ; but many exceptionsare allowed, which either demolish the wholeefficiency of the judgment, as such, or leave it open tocollateral proofs, which in a great measure impair itsvalidity. To treat suitably of this subject would requirea large dissertation, and appropriately belongs toanother branch of public law.§ 659. The general rule of the common law, recognisedboth in England and America, is, that foreign judgmentsare prima facie evidence of the right and matter,which they purport to decide. At least, this may beasserted to be in England the preponderating weight ofopinion ; and in America it has been held, upon many occasions,though its correctness has been recently questioned,upon principle and authority, with much acuteness.^ 660. Before the revolution, the colonies weredeemed foreign to each other, as the British coloniesare still deemed foreign to the mother country ; and, ofcourse, their judgments were deemed foreign judgmentswithin the scope of the foregoing rule. It followed,that the judgments of one colony were deemedre-examinable in another, not only as to the jurisdictionof the court, which pronounced them ; but also as tothe merits of the controversy, to the extent, in whichthey were then understood to be re-examinable inEngland. In some of the colonies, however, laws hadbeen passed, which put judgments in the neighbouringcolonies upon a like footing with domestic judgments,as to their conclusiveness, when the court possessedjurisdiction. The reasonable construction of the articleof the confederation on this subject is, that it was intendedto give the same conclusive effect to judgmentsof all the states, so as to promote uniformity, as well as472 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.certainty, in the rule among them. It is probable, thatit did not invariably, and perhaps not generally, receivesuch a construction ; and the amendment in theconstitution was, without question, designed to cure thedefects in the existing provision.§ 661. The clause of the constitution propounds threedistinct objects ; first, to declare, that full faith andcredit shall be given to the records, &c. of every otherstate ; secondly, to prescribe the manner of authenticatingthem; and thirdly, to prescribe their effect, whenso authenticated. The first is declared, and establishedby the constitution itself, and is to receive no aid from,nor is it susceptible of any qualification by, congress.The other two are expressly subjected to the legislativepower.CH. XXX.] POWERS OF CONGRESS-TERRITORIES. 473CHAPTER XXX.POWERS OF CONGRESS ADMISSION OF NEW STATES,AND ACQUISITION OF TERRITORY.^ 662. The third section of the fourth article containstwo distinct clauses. The first is — " New statesmay be admitted by the congress into this Union."But no new state shall be formed or erected withinthe jurisdiction of any other state, nor any state beformed by the junction of two or more states, or"parts of states, without the consent of the legislatureof the states concerned, as well as of the congress."§ 663. In the articles of confederation no provisionis to be found on this important subject. Canada wasto be admitted of right, upon her acceding to the measuresof the United States. But no other colony (bywhich was evidently meant no other British colony)was to be admitted, unless by the consent of nine states.The eventual establishment of new states within thelimits of the Union seems to have been wholly overlookedby the framers of that instrument. In the progressof the revolution it was not only perceived, thatfrom the acknowledged extent of the territory of severalof the states, and its geographical position, it mightbe expedient to divide it into two states ; but a mucljmore interesting question arose, to whom of right belongedthe vacant territory appertaining to the crownat the time of the revolution, whether to the states,within whose chartered limits it was situated, or to theUnion in its federative capacity. This was a subject oflong and ardent controversy, and (as has been alreadysuggested) threatened to disturb the peace, if not toAbn 60474 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.overthrow the government of the Union. It was uponthis ground, that several of the states refused to ratifythe articles of confederation, insisting upon the right ofthe confederacy to a portion of the vacant and unlamentedterritory included within their chartered limits.Some of the states most interested in the vacant andunlamented western territory, at length yielded to theearnest solicitations of congress on this subject. Toinduce them to make liberal cessions, congress declared,that the ceded territory should be disposed of forthe common benefit of the Union, and formed into republicanstates, with the same rights of sovereignty,freedom, and independence, as the other states ; to beof a suitable extent of territory, not less than one hundred,nor more than one hundred and fifty miles square ;and that the reasonable expenses incurred by the state,'since the commencement of the war, in subduing Britishposts, or in maintaining and acquiring the territory,should be reimbursed.§ 664. It was doubdess with reference principally tothis territory, that the article of the constitution, nowunder consideration, was adopted. The general precaution,that no new states shall be formed without theconcurrence of the national government, and of thestates concerned, is consonant to the principles, whichought to govern all such transactions. The particularprecaution against the erection of new states by thepartition of a state without its own consent, sill quietthe jealousy of the larger states ; as that of the smallerwill also be quieted by a like precaution' against a junctionof states without their consent. Under this provisionno less than eleven states have, in the space oflitde more than forty years, been admitted into the Unionupon an equality with the original states. And itCH, XXX.] POWERS OF CONGRESS - TERRITORIES. 475scarcely requires the spirit of prophecy to foretell, thatin a few years the predominance of numbers, of population,and of power, will be unequivocally transferredfrom the old to the new states. May the patriotic wishbe for ever true to the fact, felix prole parens.476 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.CHAPTER XXXI.POWERS OF CONGRESS— TERRITORIAL Governments,^ 665. The next clause of the same article is, " Thecongress shall have power to dispose of, and make all*' needful rules and regulations respecting the territory^* and other property belonging to the United States ;and nothing in this constitution shall be so construed,*' as to prejudice any claims of the United States, or*• of any particular state." The proviso thus annexed tothe power is certainly proper in itself, and was probablyrendered necessary by the jealousies and questions concerningthe Western territory, which have been alreadyalluded to under the preceding head. It was perhapssuggested by the clause in the ninth article of the confederation,which contained a proviso, " that no stateshall be deprived of territory for the benefit of the UnitedStates." -§ 666, As the general government possesses theright to acquire territory, either by conquest, or by treaty,it would seem to follow, as an inevitable consequence,that it possesses the power to govern, what it has soacquired. The territory does not, when so acquired,become entided to self-government, and it is not subjectto the jurisdiction of any state. It must, consequently,be under the dominion and jurisdiction of theUnion, or it would be without any government at all.In cases of conquest, the usage of the world is, if a nationis not wholly subdued, to consider the conqueredterritory, as merely held by military occupation, untilCH. XXXI.] POWERS OF CONGRESS-TERRITORIES. 477its fate shall be determined by a treaty of peace.But during this intermediate period it is exclusivelysubject to the government of the conqueror. In casesof confirmation or cession by treaty, the acquisitionbecomes firm and stable ; and the ceded territory becomesa part of the nation, to which it is annexed,either on terms stipulated in the treaty, or on such, asits new master shall impose. The relations of the inhabitantswith each other do not change ; but theirrelations .with their former sovereign are dissolved ;and new relations are created between them and theirnew sovereign. The act transferring the country transfersthe allegiance of its inhabitants. But the generallaws, not strictly political, remain, as they were, untilaltered by the new sovereign. If the treaty stipulates,that they shall enjoy the privileges, rights, and immunitiesof citizens of the United States, the treaty, as apart of the law of the land, becomes obligatory in theserespects. Whether the same effects would result fromthe mere fact of their becoming inhabitants and citizensby the cession, without any express stipulation, maydeserve inquiry, if the question should ever occur.But they do not participate in political power ; nor canthey share in the powers of the general government,until they become a state, and are admitted into theUnion, as such. Until that period, the territory remainssubject to be governed in such manner, as congressshall direct, under the clause of the constitutionnow under consideration.^ 667. No one has ever doubted the authority ofcongress to erect territorial governments within theterritory of the United States, under the general languageof the clause, "to make all needful rules andregulations." Indeed, with the ordinance of 1787 inI478 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.the very view of the framers, as well as of the people ofthe states, it is impossible to doubt, that such a powerwas deemed indispensable to the purposes of thecessions made by the states. So that, notwithstandingthe generality of the objection, (already examined,)that congress have no power to erect corporations, andthat in the convention the power was refused, we see,that the very power is an incident to that of regulatingthe territory of the United States ; that is, it is an appropriatemeans of carrying the power into effect.What shall be the form of government establishedin the territories depends exclusively upon the discretionof congress. Having a right to erect a territorialgovernment, they may confer on it such powers, legislative,judicial, and executive, as they may deem best.They may confer upon it general legislative powers,subject only to the laws and constitution of the UnitedStates. If the power to create courts is given to theterritorial legislature, those courts aie to be deemedstrictly territorial ; and in no just sense constitutionalcourts, in which the judicial power conferred by theconstitution can be deposited. They are incapable ofreceiving it. They are legislative courts, created invirtue of the general right of sovereignty in the government,or in virtue of that clause, which enables congressto make all needful rules and regulations respectingthe territory of the United States. The power isnot confined to the territory of the United States ; butextends to " other property belonging to the UnitedStates ;" so that it may be applied to the due regulationof all other personal and real property rightfullybelonging to the United States. And so it has beenconstantly understood, and acted upon.CH. XXXI.] POWERS OF CONGRESS-TERRITORIES. 479§ 668. The power of congress over the publicterritory is clearly exclusive and universal ; and theirlegislation is subject to no control ; but is absolute,and unlimited, unless so far as is affected by stipulationsin the cessions, or by the ordinance of 1787, underwhich any part of it has been settled. But thepower of congress to regulate the other nationalproperty (unless they have acquired, by cession of thestates, exclusive jurisdiction) is not necessarily exclusivein all cases. If the national government own afort, arsenal, hospital, or lighthouse establishment, notso ceded, the general jurisdiction of the state is notexcluded in regard to the site; but, subject to therightful exercise of the powers of the national government,it remains in full force.^ 669. There are some other incidental powersgiven to congress, to carry into effect certain otherprovisions of the constitution. But they will mostproperly come under consideration in a future partof these Commentaries. At present, it may suffice tosay, that with reference to due energy in the government,due protection of the national interests, and duesecurity to the Union, fewer powers could scarcelyhave been granted, without departing the whole system.Without the power of the purse, the power to declarewar, or to promote the common defence, or generalwelfare, would have been wholly vain and illusory.Without the power exclusively to regulate commerce,the intercourse between the states would have .beenconstantly liable to domestic dissentions, jealousies, andrivalries, and to foreign hostilities, and retaliatory restrictions.The other powers are principally auxiliaryto these ; and are dictated at once by an enlightenedpolicy, a devotion to justice, and a regard to the per-constitutionOF THE U. STATES. [bOOK HI.mayence (may it ripen into a perpetuity!) of theUnion.§ 670. As there are incidental powers belonging tothe United States in their sovereign capacity, so thereare incidental rights, obligations, and duties* It maybeasked, how these are to be ascertained. In the firstplace, as to duties and obligations of a public nature,they are to be ascertained by the law of nations, towhich, on asserting our independence, we necessarilybecame subject. In regard to municipal rights andobligations, whatever differences of opinion may arisein regard to the extent, to which the common law attachesto the national government, no one can doubt,that it must, and ought to be resorted to, in order to ascertainmany of its rights and obligations. Thus, whena contract is entered into by the United States, wenaturally and necessarily resort to the common law, tointerpret its terms, and ascertain its obligations. Thesame general rights, duties, and limitations, which thecommon law attaches to contracts of a similar characterbetween private individuals, are applied to the contractsof the government. Thus, if the United Statesbecome the holder of a bill of exchange, they are boundto the same diligence, as to giving notice, in order tocharge an indorser, upon the dishonour of the bill, asaprivate holder would be. In like manner, when abond is entered into by a surety for the faithful dischargeof the duties of an office by his principal, thenature and extent of the obligation, created by the instrument,are constantly ascertained by reference to thecommon law ; though the bond is given to the governmentin its sovereign capacity.C H. XXXII.] POWERS OF CONGRESS-SLAVE-TRADE. 481CHAPTER XXXII.PROHIBITIONS ON THE UNITED STATES.^671. Having finished this review of the powersof congress, the order of the subject next conducts usto the prohibitions and limitations upon these powers,which are contained in the ninth section of the firstarticle. Some of these have already been under discussion,and therefore will be pretermitted.§ 672. The first clause is as follows : " The migration,or importation of such persons, as any of thestates now existing shall think proper to admit, shall"not be prohibited by the congress, prior to the yearone thousand eight hundred and eight ; but a tax,or duty, may be imposed on such importation, notexceeding ten dollars for each person."§ 673. It is to the honour of America, that sheshould have set the first example of interdicting andabolishing the slave-trade, in modern times. It is wellknown, that it constituted a grievance, of which someof the colonies complained before the revolution, thatthe introduction of slaves was encouraged by thecrown, and that prohibitory laws were negatived. Itwas doubtless to have been wished, that the power ofprohibiting the importation of slaves had been allowedto be put into immediate operation, and had not beenpostponed for twenty years. But it is not difficult toaccount, either for this restriction, or for the manner, inwhich it is expressed. It ought to be considered, as agreat point gained in favour of humanity, that a periodof twenty years might forever terminate, within theAhr. 61482 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.United States, a traffic, which had so long, and so loudlyupbraided the barbarism of modern policy. Evenwithin this period, it might receive a very considerablediscouragement, by curtailing the traffic between foreigncountries; and it might even be totally abolished bythe concurrence of a few states. "Happy," (it was thenadded by the Federalist,) " would it be for the unfortunateAfricans, if an equal prospect lay before them ofbeing redeemed from the oppressions of their Europeanbrethren." Let it be remembered, that at this periodthis horrible traffic was carried on with the encouragementand support of every civilized nation of Europe ;and by none with more eagerness and enterprize, thanby the parent country. America stood forth alone, un-cheeredand unaided, in stamping ignominy upon thistraffic on the very face of her constitution of government,although there were strong temptations of interestto draw her aside from the performance of thisgreat moral duty.^ 674. The next clause is, "The privilege of thewrit of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unlesswhen, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the publicsafety may require it."§ 675. In order to understand the meaning of theterms here used, it will be necessary to have recourse tothe common law ; for in no other way can we arriveat the true definition of the writ of habeas corpus. Atthe common law there are various writs, called writs ofhabeas corpus. But the particular one here spoken of isthat great and celebrated writ, used in all cases of illegalconfinement, known by the name of the writ of habeascorpus ad subjiciendum, directed to the person detaininganother, and commanding him to produce the body ofthe prisoner, with the day and cause of his caption andCH. XXXII.] POWERS OF CONGRESS-ahab. CORPUS. 483detention, ad faciendum, subjiciendum, et recipiendum,to do, submit to, and receive, whatsoever the judge orcourt, awarding such writ, shall consider in that behalf.It is, therefore, justly esteemed the great bulwark ofpersonal liberty ; since it is the appropriate remedy toascertain, whether any person is rightfully in confinementor not, and the cause of his confinement ; and ifno sufficient ground of detention appears, the party isentided to his immediate discharge. This writ is mostbeneficially construed ; and is applied to every case ofillegal restraint, whatever it may be ; for every restraintupon a man's liberty is, in the eye of the law, an imprisonment,wherever may be the place, or whatevermay be the manner, in which the restraint is effected.§ 676. It is obvious, that cases of a peculiar emergencymay arise, which may justify, nay even require,the temporary suspension of the right to this writ.But as it has frequency happened in foreign countries,and even in England, that the writ has, upon variouspretexts and occasions, been suspended, whereby persons,apprehended upon suspicion, have suffered a longimprisonment, sometimes from design, and sometimes,because they were forgotten, the right to suspend it isexpressly confined to cases of rebellion or invasion,where the public safety may require it ; a very justand wholesome restraint, which cuts down at a blow afruitful means of oppression, capable of being abused inbad times to the worst of purposes. Hitherto no suspensionof the writ has ever been authorized by congresssince the establishment of the consdtudon. Itwould seem, as the power is given to congress tosuspend the writ of habeas corpus in cases of rebellionor invasion, that the right to judge, whether exigencyhad arisen, must exclusively belong to that body.484 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.^ 677. 'the next clause is, " No bill of attainder orex post facto law shall be passed."§ 678. Bills of attainder, as they are technicallycalled, are such special acts of the legislature, as inflictcapital punishments upon persons supposed to be guiltyof high offences, such as treason and felony, withoutany conviction in the ordinary course of judicial proceedings.If an act inflicts a milder degree of punishmentthan death, it is called a bill of pains and penalties.But in the sense of the constitution, it seems,that bills of attainder include bills of pains and penalties;for the Supreme Court have said, " A bill of attaindermay affect the Hfe of an individual, or may confiscatehis property, or both." In such cases, the legislatureassumes judicial magistracy, pronouncing upon theguilt of the party without any of the common forms andguards of trial, and satisfying itself with proofs, whensuch proofs are within its reach, whether they areconformable to the rules of evidence, or not. In short,in all such cases, the legislature exercises the highestpower of sovereignty, and what may properly bedeemed an irresponsible despotic discretion, being governedsolely by what it deems political necessity or expediency,and too often under the influence of unreasonablefears, or unfounded suspicions. Such actshave been often resorted to in foreign governments, asacommon engine of state ; and even in England theyhave been pushed to the most extravagant extent inbad times, reaching, as west to the absent and the dead,as to the living. Sir Edward Coke has mentioned it tobe among the transcendent powers of parliament, thatan act may be passed to attaint a man, after he is dead.And the reigning monarch, who was slain at Bosworth,is said to have been attainted by an act of parliamentCH. XXXII.] POWERS OF CONGRESS-attainder. 485a few months after his death, notwithstanding theabsurdity of deeming him at once in possession of thethrone and a traitor. The punishment has often beeninflicted without calling upon the party accused toanswer, or without even the formality of proof; andsometimes, because the law, in its ordinary course ofproceedings, would acquit the offender. The injusticeand iniquity of such acts, in general, constitute an irresistibleargument against the existence of the power.In a free government it would be intolerable ; and inthe hands of a reigning faction, it might be, and probablywould be, abused to the ruin and death of the most virtuouscitizens. Bills of this sort have been most usuallypassed in England in times of rebellion, or of grosssubserviency to the crown, or of violent political excitements; periods, in which all nations are most liable(as well the free, as the enslaved) to forget their duties,and to trample upon the rights and liberties ofothers.^ 679. Of the same class are ex post facto laws,that is to say, (in a literal sense,) laws passed after theact done. The terms, ex post facto laws, in a comprehensivesense, embrace all retrospective laws, or lawsgoverning, or controlling past transactions, whetherthey are of a civil, or a criminal nature. And there havenot been wanting learned minds, that have contendedwith no small force of authority and reasoning, thatsuch ought to be the interpretation of the terms in theconstitution of the United States. As an originalquestion, the argument would be entitled to grave consideration; but the current of opinion and authority hasbeen so generally one way, as to the meaning of thisphrase in the state constitutions, as well as in that ofthe United States, ever since their adoption, that it is486 Constitution OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.difficult to feel, that it is now an open question. Thegeneral interpretation has been, and is, that the phraseapplies to acts of a criminal nature only ; and, that theprohibition reaches every law, whereby an act is declareda crime, and made punishable as such, when it wasnot a crime, when done ; or whereby the act, if a crime,is aggravated in enormity, or punishment ; or wherebydifferent, or less evidence, is required to convict anoffender, than was required, when the act was committed.^ 680. The next clause (passing by such, as havebeen already considered) is, "No money shall be"drawn from the treasury, but in consequence of appropriationsmade by law. And a regular statementand account of the receipts and expenditures of allpublic money shall be published from time to time."^681. The object is apparent upon the slightestexamination. It is to secure regularity, punctuality,and fidelity, in the disbursement of the public money.As all the taxes raised from the people, as well as therevenues arising from other sources, are to be appliedto the discharge of the expenses, and debts, and otherengagements of the government, it is highly proper,that congress should possess the power to decide, howand when any money should be applied for thesepurposes. If it were otherwise, the executive wouldpossess an unbounded power over the public purse ofthe nation ; and might apply all its monied resourcesat his pleasure. The power to control, and direct theappropriations, constitutes a most useful and salutarycheck upon profusion and extravagance, as well as uponcorrupt influence and public peculation. In arbitrarygovernments the prince levies what money he pleasesfrom his subjects, disposes of it, as he thinks proper.CH. XXXII.] POWERS OF CONGRESS NOBILITY. 487and is beyond responsibility or reproof. It is wise tointerpose, in a republic, every restraint, by whichthe public treasure, the common fund of all, should beapplied with shrinking honesty to such objects, aslegitimately belong to the common defence, and thegeneral welfare. Congress is made the guardian ofthis treasure ; and to make their responsibility completeand perfect, a regular account of the receipts and expendituresis required to be published, that the peoplemay know, what money is expended, for what purposes,and by what authority.§ 682. The next clause is, "No tide of nobility shallbe granted by the United States; and no person holdsingany office of profit or trust under them shall, withoutthe consent of the congress, accept of any present,emolument, office, or title of any kind whatever, from*' any king, prince, or foreign state."^ 683. This clause seems scarcely to require even apassing notice. As a perfect equality is the basis ofall our institutions, state and national, the prohibitionagainst the creation of any tides of nobility seems proper,if not indispensable, to keep perpetually alive ajust sense of this important truth. Distinctions betweencitizens, in regard to rank, would soon lay the foundationof odious claims and privileges, and silently subvertthe spirit of independence and personal dignity,which are so often proclaimed to be the best securityof a republican government.^ 684. The other clause, as to the acceptance ofany emoluments, tide, or office, from foreign governments,is founded in a just jealousy of foreign influenceof every sort. Whether, in a practical sense, itcan produce much effect, has been thought doubtful. Apatriot will not be likely to be seduced from his duties488 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.to his country by the acceptance of any title, or present,from a foreign power. An intriguing, or corruptagent, will not be restrained from guilty machinationsin the service of a foreign state by such constitutionalrestrictions. Still, however, the provision is highly important,as it puts it out of the power of any officer ofthe government to wear borrowed honours, which shallenhance his supposed importance abroad by a titulardignity at home.CH. XXXIII.] Prohibitions TREATIES. 489CHAPTER XXXIII.PROHIBITIONS ON THE STATES.§ 685. The tenth section of the first article (to whichwe are now to proceed) contains the prohibitions andrestrictions upon the authority of the states. Some ofthese, and especially those, which regard the power oftaxation, and the regulation of commerce, have alreadypassed under consideration ; and will, therefore, behere omitted. The others will be examined in the orderof the text of the constitution.§ 686. The first clause is, " No state shall enter intoany treaty, alliance, or confederation ; grant letters ofmarque or reprisal ; coin money ; emit bills of credit ;make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in"payment of debts; pass any bill of attainder, ex post^^ facto law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts ;or grant any tide of nobility."^ 687. The prohibition against treaties, alliances, andconfederations, constituted a part of the articles of confederation,and was from thence transferred in substanceinto the constitution. The sound policy, nay, the necessityof it, for the preservation of any national government,is so obvious, as to strike the most careless mind.If every state were at liberty to enter into any treaties,alliances, or confederacies, with any foreign state, itwould become utterly subversive of the power confidedto the national government on the same subject. Engagementsmight be entered into by different states,utterly hostile to the interests of neighbouring or distantstates ; and thus the internal peace and harmonyAhr. 62490 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.of the Union might be destroyed, or put in jeopardy.A foundation might thus be laid for preferences, andretaliatory systems, which would render the power oftaxation, and the regulation of commerce, by the nationalgovernment, utterly futile. Besides ; the intimatedangers to the Union ought not to be overlooked, bythus nourishing within its own bosom a perpetual sourceof foreign corrupt influence, which, in times of politicalexcitement and war, might be wielded to the destructionof the independence of the country. This, indeed,was deemed, by the authors of the Federalist,too clear to require any illustration. The correspondingclauses in the confederation were still morestrong, direct, and exact, in their language and import.^ 688. The prohibition to grant letters of marque andreprisal stands upon the same general ground ; forotherwise it would be in the power of a single state toinvolve the whole Union in war at its pleasure. It istrue, that the granting of letters of marque and reprisalis not always a preliminary to war, or necessarily designedto provoke it. But in its essence, it is a hostilemeasure for unredressed grievances, real or supposed ;and therefore it is most generally the precursor of an appealto arms by general hostilities. The security (ashas been justly observed) of the whole Union oughtnot to be suffered to depend upon the petulance or precipitationof a single state. The constitution has wiselyboth in peace and war, confided the whole subject tothe general government. Uniformity is thus securedin all operations, which relate to foreign powers ; andan immediate responsibility to the nation on the part ofthose, for whose conduct the nation is itself responsible.CH. XXXIII.] PROHIBITIONS COINAGE. 491§ 689. The next prohibition is to coin money. Wehave already seen, that the power' to coin money, andregulate the value thereof, is confided to the generalgovernment. Under the confederation a concurrentpower was left in the states, with a restriction, thatcongress should have the exclusive power to regulatethe alloy and value of the coin struck by the states. Inthis, as in many other cases, the constitution hasmade a great improvement, upon the existing system.Whilst the alloy and value depended on the generalgovernment, a right of coinage in the several statescould have no other effect, than to multiply expensivemints, and diversify the forms and weights of the circulatingcoins. The latter inconvenience would defeatone main purpose, for which the power is given to thegeneral government, viz. uniformity of the currency ;and the former might be as well accomplished by localmints established by the national government, if itshould ever be found inconvenient to send bullion, orold coin for recoinage to the central mint. The truthis, that the prohibition had a higher motive, the dangerof the circulation of base and spurious coin connived atfor local purposes, or easily accomplished by the ingenuityof artificers, where the coins are very various invalue and denomination, and issued from so many independentand unaccountable authorities. This subjecthas, however, been already enlarged on in anotherplace.§ 690. The prohibition to "emit bills of credit"cannot, perhaps, be more forcibly vindicated, than byquoting the glowing language of the Federalist, a languagejustified by that of almost every contemporarywriter, and attested in its truth by facts, from which themind involuntarily turns away at once with disgust and492 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.indignation. " This prohibition," says the Federalist,must give pleasure to every citizen in proportion tohis love of justice, and his knowledge of the true springsof public prosperity. The loss, which America hassustained since the peace from the pestilent effects ofpaper money on the necessary confidence betweenman and man ; on the necessary confidence in the publiccouncils ; on the industry and morals of the people ;and on the character of republican government, constitutesan enormous debt against the states, chargeablewith this unadvised measure, which must long remainunsatisfied ; or rather an accumulation of guilt, whichcan be expiated no otherwise, than by a voluntary sacrificeon the altar of justice of the power, which hasbeen the instrument of it. In addition to these persuasiveconsiderations, it may be observed, that the samereasons, which show the necessity of denying to thestates the power of regulating coin, prove with equalforce, that they ought not to be at liberty to substitutea paper medium, instead of coin. Had every state aright to regulate the value of its coin, there might be asmany different currencies, as states ; and thus the intercourseamong them would be impeded. Retrospectivealterations in its value might be made ; and thusthe citizens of other states be injured, and animositiesbe kindled among the states themselves. The subjectsof foreign powers might suffer from the same cause ;and hence the Union be discredited, and embroiled bythe indiscretion of a single member. No one ofthese mischiefs is less incident to a power in thestates to emit paper money, than to coin gold or silkver."§ 691. Without doubt the melancholy shades of thispicture were deepened by the urgent distresses of theCH. XXXIII.] PROHIBITIONS PAPER MONEY. 493revolutionary war, and the reluctance of the states toperform their proper duty. And some apology, if notsome justification of the proceedings, may be found inthe eventful transactions and sufferings of those times.But the history of paper money, without any adequatefunds pledged to redeem it, and resting merely uponthe pledge of the public faith, has been in all ages andin all nations the same. It has constantly becomemore and more depreciated ; and in some instances hasceased from this cause to have any circulation whatsoever,whether issued by the irresistible edict of a despot,or by the more alluring order of a republican congress.There is an abundance of illustrative facts scatteredover the history of those of the American colonies,which ventured upon this pernicious scheme of raisingmoney to supply the public wants, during their subjectionto the British crown ; and in the several states,from the declaration of independence down to the presenttimes. Even the United States, with almost inexhaustibleresources, and with a population of 9,000,000of inhabitants, exhibited during the late war withGreat-britain the humiliating spectacle of treasurynotes, issued and payable in a year, remaining unredeemed,and sunk by depreciation to about half of theirnominal value !^ 692. It would seem to be obvious, that as thestates are expressly prohibited from coining money, theprohibition would be wholly ineffectual, if they mightcreate a paper currency, and circulate it as money.But, as it might become necessary for the states toborrow money, the prohibition could not be intended toprevent such an exercise of power, on giving to thelender a certificate of the amount borrowed, and apromise to repay it.494 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.§ 693. What, then, is the true meaning of the phrase"bills of credit" in the constitution? In its enlarged,and perhaps in its literal sense, it may comprehend anyinstrument, by which a state engages to pay money ata future day (and of course, for which it obtains a presentcredit ;) and thus it would include a certificate givenfor money borrowed. But the language af the constitutionitself, and the mischief to be prevented, whichwe know from the history of our country, equally limitthe interpretation of the terms. The word " emit " isnever employed in describing those contracts, by whicha state binds itself to pay money at a future day forservices actually received, or for money borrowed forpresent use. Nor are instruments, executed for suchpurposes, in common language denominated " bills ofcredit." To emit bills of credit conveys to the mindthe idea of issuing paper, intended to circulate throughthe community for its ordinary purposes, as money,which paper is redeemable at a future day. This is thesense, in which the terms of the constitution have beengenerally understood. The phrase (as we have seen)v*^as well known, and generally used to indicate thepaper currency, issued by the states during their colonialdependence. During the war of our revolutionthe paper currency issued by congress was constantlydenominated, in the acts of that body, bills of credit ;and the like appellation was applied to similar currencyissued by the states. The phrase had thus acquired adeterminate and appropriate meaning. At the time ofthe adoption of the constitution, bills of credit wereuniversally understood to signify a paper medium intendedto circulate between individuals, and betweengovernment and individuals, for the ordinary purposesof society. Such a medium has always been liable toCH. XXXIII.] PROHIBITIONS PAPER MONEY. 495considerable fluctuation. Its value is continually changing; and these changes, often great and sudden, exposeindividuals to immense possess, are the sources of ruinousspeculations, and destroy all proper confidencebetween man and man. In no country, more than ourown, had these truths been felt in all their force. Innone had more intense suffering, or more wide-spreadingruin accompanied the system. It vas, therefore,the object of the prohibition to cut up the whole mischiefby the roots, because it had been deeply feltthroughout all the states, and had deeply affected theprosperity of all. The object of the prohibition was notto prohibit the thing, w^hen it bore a particular name ;but to prohibit the thing, whatever form or name itmight assume. If the words are not merely emptysounds, the prohibition must comprehend the emissionof any paper medium by a state government for thepurposes of common circulation. It would be preposterousto suppose, that the constitution meant solemnlyto prohibit an issue under one denomination, leavingthe powder complete to issue the same thing underanother. It can never be seriously contended, thatthe constitution means to prohibit names, and not things ;to deal with shadows, and to leave substances. Whatwould be the consequence of such a construction*?That a very important act, big with great and ruinousmischief, and on that account forbidden by words themost appropriate for its description, might yet be performedby the substitution of a name. That the constitution,even in one of its vital provisions, might beopenly evaded by giving a new name to an old thing.Call the thing a bill of credit, and it is prohibited.Call the same thing a certificate, and it is constitutional.496 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.§ 694. The next prohibition is, that no state shallmake any thing but gold and silver coin, a tender in"payment of debts." This clause was manifestlyfounded in the same general policy, which procured theadoption of the preceding clause. The history, indeed,of the various laws, which were passed by the statesin their colonial and independent character upon thissubject, is startling at once to our morals, to our patriotism,and to our sense of justice. Not only was papermoney issued, and declared to be a tender in paymentof debts,; but laws of another character, well knownunder the appellation of tender laws, appraisement laws,instalment laws, and suspension laws, were from timeto time enacted, which prostrated all private credit,and all private morals. By some of these laws, thedue payment of debts was suspended ; debts were,in violation of the very terms of the contract, authorizedto be paid by instalments at different periods ; propertyof any sort, however worthless, either real or personal,might be tendered by the debtor in payment ofhis debts; and the creditor was compelled to take theproperty of the debtor, which he might seize on execution,at an appraisement wholly disproportionate to itsknown value. Such grievances, and oppressions, andothers of a like nature, were the ordinary results oflegislation during the revolutionary war, and the intermediateperiod down to the formation of the constitution.They entailed the most enormous evils on thecountry ; and introduced a system of fraud, chicanery,and profligacy, which destroyed all private confidence,industry, and enterprise.§ 695. The next prohibition is, that no state shallpass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or lawimpairing the obligation of contracts." The two .XXXIII.] PROHIBITIONS ATTAINDER. 497er require no commentary, beyond what has been alreadyoffered, under a similar prohibitory clause appliedto the government of the United States. The samepolicy and principles apply to each. It would havebeen utterly useless, if not absurd, to deny a power tothe Union, which might at the same time be appliedby the states to purposes equally mischievous, and tyrannical; and which might, when applied by the states,be for the very purpose of subverting the Union. Beforethe constitution of the United States was adopted,every state, unless prohibited by its own constitution,might pass a bill of attainder, or ex post facto law, as ageneral result of its sovereign legislative power. Andsuch a prohibition would not be implied from a constitutionalprovision, that the legislative, executive, andjudiciary departments shall be separate, and distinct ;that crimes shall be tried in the county, where they arecommitted ; or that the trial by jury shall remain inviolate.The power to pass such laws would still remain,at least so far as respects crimes committed without thestate. . During the revolutionary war, bills of attainder,and ex post facto acts of confiscation were passed to awide extent ; and the evils resulting therefrom weresupposed, in times of more cool reflection, to have faroutweighed any imagined good.Abr, 63498 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.CHAPTER XXXIV.PROHIBITIONS ON THE STATES IMPAIRINGCONTRACTS.^ 696. The remaining clause, as to impairing theobligation of contracts, will require a more full and deliberateexamination.^ 697. In the first place, what is to be deemed acontract, in the constitutional sense of this clause ? Acontract is an agreement to do, or not to do, a particularthing ; or (as was said on another occasion) a contract isa compact between two or more persons. A contractis either executory, or executed. An executory contractis one, in which a party binds himself to do, ornot to do, a particular thing. An executed contract isone, in which the object of the contract is performed.This differs in nothing from a grant ; for a contractexecuted conveys a chose in possession; a, contract executoryconveys only a chose in action. Since, then, agrant is in fact a contract executed, the obligation of whichcontinues ; and since the consdtution uses the generalterm, contract, without distinguishing between those,which are executory, and those, which are executed ; itmust be construed to comprehend the former, as wellas the latter. A state law, therefore, annulling conveyancesbetween individuals, and declaring, that the grantorsshall stand seized of their former estates notwithstandingthose grants, would be as repugnant to theconstitution, as a state law discharging the vendorsfrom the obligation of executing their contracts of saleCH. XXXIV. PROHIBITIONS — CONTRACTS. 499by conveyances. It would be strange, indeed, if a contractto convey were secured by the constitution, \ hilean absolute conveyance remained unprotected. Thatthe contract, while executory, was obligatory ; but whenexecuted, might be avoided.§ 698. Contracts, too, are express, or implied.Express contracts are, where the terms of the agreementare openly avowed, and uttered at the time of themaking of it. Implied contracts are such, as reasonand justice dictate from the nature of the transaction,and which therefore the law presumes, that every manundertakes to perform. The constitution makes nodistinction between the one class of contracts and thother. It then equally embraces, and applies to both.Indeed, as by far the largest class of contracts in civilsociety, in the ordinary transactions of life, are implied,there would be very little object in securing the inviolabilityof express contracts, if those, which are implied,might be impaired by state legislation. The constitutionis not chargeable with such folly, or inconsistency.Every grant in its own nature amounts to an extinguishmentof the right of the grantor, and impHes acontract not to re-assert it. A party is, therefore, alwaysestopped by his own grant. How absurd wouldit be to provide, that an express covenant by him,as a muniment attendant upon the estate, should bindhim for ever, because executory, and resting in action ;and yet, that he might re-assert his title to the estate,and dispossess his grantee, because there was only animplied covenant not to re-assert it.^ 699. In the next place, what is the obligation ofa contract 1 It would seem difficult to substitute wordsmore intelligible, or less liable to misconstruction, thanthese. And yet they have given rise to much acute500 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.disquisition, as to their real meaning in the constitution.It has been said, that right and obligation are correlativeterms. Whatever I, by my contract, give anothera right to require of me, I, by that act lay myself underan obligation to yield or bestow. The obligation ofevery contract, then, will consist of that right, or powerover my will or actions, which I, by my contract, conferon another. And that right and power will be foundto be measured, neither by moral law alone, nor byuniversal law alone, nor by the laws of society alone ;but by a combination of the three ; an operation, inwhich the moral law is explained, and applied by thelaw of nature, and both modified, and adapted to theexigencies of society by positive law. In an advancedstate of society, all contracts of men receive a relative,and not a positive interpretation. The state construesthem, the state applies them, the state controls them,and the state decides, how far the social exercise of therights, which the give over each party, can be justly asserted.Again, it has been said, that the constitutiondistinguishes between a contract, and the obligation ofa contract. The latter is the law, which binds the partiesto perform their agreement. The law, then, which hasthis binding obligation, must govern and control thecontract in every shape, in which it is intended to bearupon it. Again, it has been said, that the obligation ofa contract consists in the power and efficacy of thelaw, which apples to, and enforces performance of it,or an equivalent for non-performance. The obligationdoes not inhere, and subsist in the contract itself, propriovigore, but in the law applicable to the contract.And again, it has been said, that a contract is an agreementof the parties ; and, if it be not illegal, it bindsthem to the extent of their stipulations. Thus, if aCH. XXXIV.] PROHIBITIONS CONTRACTS. 501party contracts to pay a certain sum on a certain day,the contract binds him to perform it on that day, andthis is its obligation.^ 700. It seems agreed, that, when the obligation ofcontracts is spoken of in the constitution, we are tounderstand, not the mere moral, but the legal obligationof contracts. The moral obligation of contracts is, sofaras human society is concerned, of an imperfect kind,which the parties are left free to obey or not, as theyplease. It is addressed to the conscience of the parties,under the solemn admonitions of accountability to theSupreme Being. No human lawgiver can either impairor reach it. The constitution has not in contemplationany such obligation, but such only, as might beimpaired by a state, if not prohibited. It is the civilobligation of contracts, which it is designed to reach,that is, the obligation, which is recognised by, and resultsfrom the law of the state, in which it is made.If, therefore, a contract, when made, is by the law ofthe place declared to be illegal, or deemed to be anullity, or a nude pact,it has no civil obligation, becausethe law in such cases forbids its having any bindingefficacy, or force. It confers no legal right on the oneparty, and no correspondent legal duty on the other.There is no means allowed, or recognised, to enforce it ;for the maxim is, ex nude facto non oritur actio. Butwhen it does not fall within the predicament of beingeither illegal, or void, its obligatory force is coextensivewith its stipulations.^ 701. Nor is this obligatory force so much the resultof the positive declarations of the municipal law, asof the general principles of natural, or, (as it is sometimescalled) universal law. In a state of nature, independentof the obligations of positive law, contracts502 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.may be formed, and their obligatory force be complete.Between independent nations, treaties and compactsare formed, which are denied universally obligatory ;and yet in no just sense can they be deemed dependenton municipal law. Nay, there may exist (abstractspeaking) a perfect obligation in contracts,where there are no known and adequate means to enforcethem; as, for instance, between independentnations, where their relative strength and power precludethe possibility, on the side of the weaker parry,of enforcing them. So in the same government, wherea contract is made by a state with one of its own citizens,which yet its laws do not permit to be enforcedby any action or suit. In this predicament are theUnited States, who are not suable on any contractsmade by themselves ; but no one doubts, that these arestill obligatory on the United States. Yet their obligationis not recognised by any positive municipal law inagreat variety of cases. It depends altogether uponprinciples of public or universal law. Still, in thesecases there is a right in the one party to have the contractperformed, and the duty on the other side to performit. But, generally speaking, when we speak ofthe obligation of a contract, we include in the idea someknown means acknowledged by the municipal law toenforce it. Where all such means are absolutely denied,the obligation of the contract is understood to beimpaired, though it may not be completely annihilated.Rights may, indeed, exist without any present adequatecorrespondent remedies between private persons.Thus, a state may refuse to allow imprisonment fordebt ; and the debtor may have no property. Butstill the right of the creditor remains ; and he may enforceit against the future property of the debtor. SoCH. XXXIV.] PROHIBITIONS — CONTRACTS. 503a debtor may die without leaving any known estate, orwithout any known representative. In such cases weshould not say, that the right of the creditor was gone ;but only, that there was nothing, on which it could presentlyoperate. But suppose an administrator shouldbe appointed, and property in contingency should fallin, the right might then be enforced to the extent ofthe existing means.^ 702. The civil obligation of a contract, then,though it can never arise, or exist contrary to positivelaw, may arise or exist independently of it ; and itmay exist, notwithstanding there may be no presentadequate remedy to enforce it. Wherever the municipallaw recognises an absolute duty to perform a contract,there the obligation to perform it is complete,although there may not be a perfect remedy.§ 703. In the next place, what may properly bedeemed impairing the obligation of contracts in thesense of the constitution? It is perfectly clear, thatany law, which enlarges, abridges, or in any mannerchanges the intention of the parties, resulting from thestipulations in the contract, necessarily impairs it. Themanner or degree, in which this change is effected, canin no respect influence the conclusion; for whetherthe law affect the validity, the construction, the duration,the discharge, or the evidence of the contract, itimpairs its obligation, though it may not do so to thesame extent in all the supposed cases. Any deviationfrom its terms by postponing, or accelerating theperiod of performance, which it prescribes ; imposingconditions not expressed in the contract ; or dispensingwith the performance of those, which are a part of thecontract ; however minute, or apparently immaterial intheir effect upon it, impair its obligation. A fortiori,504 Constitution OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.a law, which makes the contract wholly invalid, or extinguishes,or releases it, is a law impairing it. Nor isthis all. Although there is a distinction between theobligation of a contract, and a remedy upon it ; yet ifthere are certain remedies existing at the time, when itis made, all of which are afterwards wholly extinguishedby new laws, so that there remain no means of enforcingits obligation, and no redress ; such an abolitionof all remedies, operating in present, is also an impairingof the obligation of such contract. But everychange and modification of the remedy does not involvesuch a consequence. No one will doubt, thatthe legislature may vary the nature and extent of remedies,so always, that some substantive remedy be infact left. Nor can it be doubted, that the legislaturemay prescribe the times and modes, in which remediesmay be pursued ; and bar suits not brought within suchperiods, and not pursued in such modes. Statutes oflimitations are of this nature ; and have never beensupposed to destroy the obligation of contracts ; but toprescribe the times, within which that obligation shallbe enforced by a suit ; and in default, to deem it eithersatisfied, or abandoned. The obligation to perform acontract is coeval with the undertaking to perform it.It originates with the contract itself, and operates anteriorto the time of performance. The remedy actsupon the broken contract, and enforces a pre-existingobligation. And a state legislature may discharge aparty from imprisonment upon a judgment in a civilcase of contract, without infringing the constitution ; forthis is but a modification of the remedy, and does notimpair the obligation of the contract. So, if a partyshould be in gaol, and give a bond for the prison liberties,and to remain a true prisoner, until lawfully discs.XXXIV.] PROHIBITIONS CONTRACTS. 505charged, a subsequent discharge by an act of the legislaturewould not impair the contract ; for it would be alawful discharge in the sense of the bond.§ 704. These general considerations naturally conductus to some more difficult inquiries growing out ofthem ; and upon which there has been a very greatdiversity of judicial opinion. The great object of theframers of the constitution undoubtedly was, to securethe inviolability of contracts. This principle was to beprotected, in whatever form it might be assailed. Noenumeration was attempted to be made of the modes,by which contracts might be impaired. It would havebeen unwise to have made such an enumeration, sinceit might have been defective ; and the intention was toprohibit every mode or device for such purpose. Theprohibition was universal.^ 705. The question has arisen, and has been mostelaborately discussed, how far the states may constitutionallypass an insolvent law, which shall dischargethe obligation of contracts. It is not doubted, that thestates may pass insolvent laws, which shall dischargethe person, or operate in the nature of a cessio bonorum,provided such laws do not discharge, or intermeddlewith the obligation of contracts. Nor is it denied, thatinsolvent laws, which discharge the obligation of contracts,made antecedently to their passage, are unconstitutional.But the question is, how far the statesmay constitutionally pass insolvent laws, which shalloperate upon, and discharge contracts, which are madesubsequently to their passage. After the most ampleargument it has at length been settled by a majority ofthe Supreme Court, that the states may constitutionallypass such laws operating upon future contracts.Ahr. 64506 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.§ 706. It has been already stated, that a grant is acontract within the meaning of the constitution, as muchas an unexecuted agreement. The prohibition, therefore,equally reaches all interferences with privategrants and private conveyances, of whatever nature theymay be. But it has been made a question, whether itapplies, in the same extent, to contracts and grants ofa state created directly by a law, or made by some authorizedagent in pursuance of a law. It has beensuggested, that, in such cases, it is to be deemed anact of the legislative power ; and that all laws are repealableby the same authority, which enacted them.But it has been decided upon solemn argument, thatcontracts and grants made by a state are not less withinthe reach of the prohibition, than contracts and grantsof private persons ; that the question is not, whethersuch contracts or grants are made directly by law inthe form of legislation, or in any other form ; but whetherthey exist at all. The legislature may, by a law, directlymake a grant ; and such grant, when once made,becomes irrevocable, and cannot be constitutionally impaired.So the legislature may make a contract withindividuals directly by a law, pledging the state to aperformance of it ; and then, when it is accepted, it isequally under the protection of the constitution. Andit may be laid down, as a general principle, that, whenevera law is in its own nature a contract, and absoluterights have vested under it, a repeal of that law cannotdivest those rights, or annihilate, or impair the title soacquired. A grant amounts to an extinguishment ofthe right of the grantor, and implies a contract not toreassert it.§ 707. The cases above spoken of are cases, inwhich rights of property are concerned, and areCH. XXXIV.] PROHIBITIONS CONTRACTS. 507manifestly within the scope of the prohibition. But aquestion of a more nice and delicate nature has beenalso litigated ; and that is, how far charters, granted bya state, are contracts within the meaning of the constitution.That the framers of the constitution did notintend to restrain the states in the regulation of theircivil institutions, adopted for internal government, isadmitted ; and it has never been so construed. It hasalways been understood, that the contracts spoken ofin the constitution were those, which respect property,or some other object of value, and which conferrights capable of being asserted in a court ofjustice. A charter is certainly in form and substancea contract ; it is a grant of powers, rights, andprivileges ; and it usually gives a capacity to take, andto hold property. Where a charter creates a corporation,it emphatically confers this capacity ; for it is anincident to a corporation, (unless prohibited,) to take,and to hold property. A charter granted to privatepersons for private purposes is within the terms, andthe reason of the prohibition. It confers rights andprivileges, upon the faith of which it is accepted. Itimparts obligations and duties on their part, which theyare not at liberty to disregard ; and it implies a contracton the part of the legislature, that the rights andprivileges, so granted, shall be enjoyed. It is whollyimmaterial in such cases, whether the corporation takefor their own private benefit, or for the benefit ofother persons.§ 708. A charter, then, being a contract within thescope of the constitution, the next consideration, whichhas arisen upon this important subject is, whether theprinciple applies to all charters, public, as well as private.Corporations are divisible into two sorts, such as are508 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.strictly public, and such as are private. Within theformer denomination are included all corporations,created for public purposes only, such as cities, towns,parishes, and other public bodies. Within the latterdenomination all corporations are included, which donot strictly belong to the former. There is no doubt,as to public corporations, which exist only for publicpurposes, that the legislature may change, modify,enlarge, and restrain them ; with this limitation, however,that property, held by such corporations, shall stillbe secured for the use of those, for whom, and at whoseexpense it has been acquired. The principle may bestated in a more general form. If a charter be a meregrant of political power, if it create a civil institution,to be employed in the administration of the government,or, if the funds be public property alone, and the.government alone be interested in the management ofthem, the legislative power over such charter is notrestrained by the constitution, but remains unlimited.The reason is, that it is only a mode of exercisingpublic rights and public powers, for the promotion ofthe general interest ; and, therefore, it must, from itsvery nature, remain subject to the legislative will, soalways that private rights are not infringed, or trenchedupon.§ 709. But an attempt has been made to press thisprinciple much farther, and to exempt from the constitutionalprohibition all charters, which, though grantedto private persons, are in reality trusts for purposesand objects, which may, in a certain sense, be deemedpublic and general. The first great case, in which thisdoctrine became the subject of judicial examinationand decision, was the case of Dartmouth College.The legislature of New-hampshire had, without theCH. XXXIV.] PROHIBITIONS CONTRACTS. 509consent of the corporation, passed an act changing theorganization of the original provincial charter of thecollege, and transferring all the rights, privileges, andfranchises from the old charter trustees to new trustees,appointed under the act. The constitutionally of theact was contested, and after solemn argument, it wasdeliberately held by the Supreme Court, that theprovincial charter was a contract within the meaningof the constitution, and that the amendatory act wasutterly void, as impairing the obligation of that charter.The college was deemed, like other colleges of privatefoundation, to be a private eleemosynary institution,endowed, by its charter, with a capacity to take property,unconnected with the government. Its funds werebestowed upon the faith of the charter, and those fundsconsisted entirely of private donations. It is true, thatthe uses were in some sense public ; that is, for thegeneral benefit, and not for the mere benefit of the corporators; but this did not make the corporation a publiccorporation. It was a private institution for generalcharity. It was not distinguishable in principle froma private donation, vested in private trustees, for apublic charity, or for a particular purpose of beneficence.And the state itself, if it had bestowed funds upon acharity of the same nature, could not resume thosefunds. In short, the charter was deemed a contract,to which the government, and the donors, and thetrustees of the corporation, were all parties. It was foravaluable consideration; for the security and dispositionof property, which was entrusted to the corporationupon the faith of its terms ; and the trustees acquiredrights under it, which could not be taken away; forthey came to them clothed with trusts, which theywere obliged to perform, and could not constitutionallydisregard.510 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.§ 710. It has also been made a question, whether acompact between two states is within the scope of theprohibition. And this also has been decided in theaffirmative. The terms, compact and contract, aresynonymous ; and, when propositions are offered byone state, and agreed to, and accepted by another,they necessarily constitute a contract between them.There is no difference, in reason or in law, to distinguishbetween contracts made by a state with individuals,and contracts made between states. Each oughtto be equally inviolable.^711. Before quitting this subject it may be properto remark, that as the prohibition, respecting ex postfacto laws, applies only to criminal cases ; and the otheris confined to impairing the obligation of contracts ;there are many laws of a retrospective character, whichmay yet be constitutionally passed by the state legislatures,however unjust, oppressive, or impolitic theymay be. Retrospective laws are, indeed, generally unjust; and, as has been forcibly said, neither accord withsound legislation, nor with the fundamental principlesof the social compact. Still they are, with the exceptionsabove stated, left open to the states, according totheir own constitutions of government ; and becomeobligatory, if not prohibited by the latter.§ 712. Whether, t indeed, independently of theconstitution of the United States, the nature of republicanand free governments does not necessarily imposesome restraints upon the legislative power, hasbeen much discussed. It seems to be the generalopinion, fortified by a strong current of judicial opinion,that since the American revolution no state governmentcan be presumed to possess the transcendentalsovereignty to take away vested rights of property ;CH. XXXIV.] PROHIBITIONS NOBILITY. 51 1to take the property of A. and transfer it to B. by amere legislative act. A government can scarcelybe deemed to be free, where the rights of propertyare left solely dependent upon a legislative body, withoutany restraint. The fundamental maxims of a freegovernment seem to require, that the rights of personalliberty, and private property should be held sacred.At least, no court of justice, in this country, would bewarranted in assuming, that any state legislature possesseda power to violate and disregard them ; or thatsuch a power, so repugnant to the common principlesof justice and civil liberty, lurked under any generalgrant of legislative authority, or ought to be impliedfrom any general expression of the will of the people,in the usual forms of the constitutional delegation ofpower. The people ought not to be presumed to partwith rights, so vital to their security and well-being,without very strong, and positive declarations to thateffect.§ 713. The remaining prohibition in this clause is,that no state shall " grant any tide of nobility'* Thereason of this prohibition is the same, as that, uponwhich the like prohibition to the government of thenation is founded. Indeed, it would be almost absurdto provide sedulously against such a power in the latter,if the states were still left free to exercise it. It hasbeen emphatically said, that this is the corner-stone ofa republican government ; for there can be litde danger,while a nobility is excluded, that the governmentwill ever cease to be that of the people.512 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK Ils.CHAPTER XXXV.PROHIBITIONS ON THE STATES.^ 714. The next clause of the constitution is,No state shall, without the consent of congress, layany duty on tonnage ; keep troops, or ships of war"in time of peace; enter into any agreement or compactwith another state, or with a foreign power ; orengage in war, unless actually invaded, or in suchimminent danger, as will not admit of delay."^715. The first part of this clause, respecting layinga duty on tonnage, has been already considered.The remaining clauses have their origin in the samegeneral policy and reasoning, which forbid any statefrom entering into any treaty, alliance, or confederation ;and from granting letters of marque and reprisal. Inregard to treaties, alliances, and confederations, theyare wholly prohibited. But a state may, with the consentof congress, enter into an agreement, or compactwith another state, or with a foreign power. Whatprecise distinction is here intended to be taken betweentreaties y and agreements, and compacts is nowhereexplained ; and has never as yet been the subjectof any exact judicial, or other examination.^716. The other prohibitions in the clause respectthe power of making war, which is appropriately confidedto the national government. The setting on footof an army, or navy by a state, in times of peace,might be a cause of jealousy between neighbouringstates, and provoke the hostilities of foreign borderingnations. In other cases, as the protection of the wholeCH. XXXV.] PROHIBITIONS MAKING-WAR. 513Union is confided to the national arm, and the nationalpower, it is not fit, that any state should possess militarymeans to overawe the Union, or to endanger thegeneral safety. Still, a state may be so situated, thatit may become indispensable to possess military forces,to resist an expected invasion, or insurrection. Thedanger may be too imminent for delay ; and undersuch circumstances, a state will have a right toraise troops for its own safety, even without the consentof congress. After war is once begun, thereis no doubt, that a state may, and indeed it ought topossess the power, to raise forces for its own defence;and its co-operation with the national forcesmay often be of great importance, to secure successand vigour in the operations of war. The prohibitionis, therefore, wisely guarded by exceptionssufficient for the safety of the states, and not justlyopen to the objection of being dangerous to theUnion.§ 717. It has been already seen, and it will hereaftermore fully appear, that there are implied, as wellas express, prohibitions in the constitution upon thepower of the states. Among the former, one clearlyis, that no state can control, or abridge, or interferewith the exercise of any authority under the nationalgovernment. And it may be added, that state laws,as, for instance, state statutes of limitations, and stateinsolvent laws, have no operation upon the rights orcontracts of the United States.§ 718. And here end our commentaries upon thefirst article of the constitution, embracing the organizationand powers of the legislative department of thegovernment, and the prohibitions upon the state andnational governments. If we here pause, but for aAhr. 65514 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.moment, we cannot but be struck with the reflection,how admirably this division and distribution of legislativepowers between the state and national governmentsis adapted to preserve the liberty, and promote thehappiness of the people of the United States. To thegeneral government are assigned all those powers,which relate to the common interests of all the states,as comprising one confederated nation. While to eachstate is reserved all those powers, which may affect, orpromote its own domestic interests, its peace, its prosperity,its policy, and its local institutions. At thesame time, such limitations and restraints are imposedupon each government, as experience has demonstratedto be wise in order to control the public functionaries,or indispensable to secure the harmonious operationsof the Union.CH. Xxxvi.] EXECUTIVE ORGANIZATION. 515CHAPTER XxxviEXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT ORGANIZATION OF.^719. In the progress of our examination of theconstitution, we are now arrived at the second article,which contains an enumeration of the organization andpowers of the executive department. What is thebest constitution for the executive department, andwhat are the powers, with which it should be entrusted,are problems among the most important, and probablythe most difficult to be satisfactorily solved, of all,which are involved in the theory of free governments.No man, who has ever studied the subject with profoundattention, has risen from the labour without anincreased and almost overwhelming sense of its intricaterelations, and perplexing doubts. No man, whohas thoroughly read the human history, and especiallythe history of republics, but has been struck with theconsciousness, how litde has been hitherto done to establisha safe depositary of power in any hands ; andhow often in the hands of one, or a few, or many, of anhereditary monarch, or of an elective chief, the executivepower has brought ruin upon the state, or sunk underthe oppressive burthen of its own imbecility. Perhapsour own history, hitherto, does not establish, that wehave wholly escaped all the dangers; and that here isnot to be found, as has been the case in other nations,• the vulnerable part of the republic.^ 720. The first clause of the first section of thesecond article is as follows: "The executive powershall be vested in a President of the United States516 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.of America. He shall hold his office during the termof four years ; and together with the Vice-president,chosen for the same term, be chosen as follows."§ 721. In considering this clause, three practicalquestions are naturally suggested : First, whether thereshould be a distinct executive department ; secondly,whether it should be composed of more than one person; and, thirdly, what should be the duration ofoffice.§ 722. Upon the first question, Hide need be said.All America have at length concurred in the proprietyof establishing a distinct executive department. Theprinciple is embraced in every state constitution ; andit seems now to be assumed among us, as a fundamentalmaxim of government, that the legislative, executive,and judicial departments ought to be separate, andthe powers of one ought not to be exercised by either ofthe others. The same maxim is found recognised inexpress terms in many of our state constitutions. It ishardly necessary to repeat, that where all these powersare united in the same hands, there is a real despotism,to the extent of their coercive exercise. Whereonthe other hand, they exist together, and yet dependfor their exercise upon the mere authority of recommendation,(as they did under the confederation,)they become at once imbecile and arbitrary, subservientto popular clamour, and incapable of steady action.§ 723. Taking it, then, for granted, that there oughtto be an executive department, the next considerationis, how it ought to be organized. It may be stated ingeneral terms, that that organization is best, which willat once secure energy in the executive, and safety tothe people. The notion, however, is not uncommon, andCH. XXXVi.] EXECUTIVE ORGANIZATION. 517occasionally finds ingenious advocates, that a vigorousexecutive is inconsistent with the genius of a republicangovernment. It is difficult to find any sufficientgrounds, on which' to rest this notion; and those,which are usually stated, belong principally to that classof minds, which readily indulge in the belief of thegeneral perfection, as well as perfectibility, of humannature, and deem the least possible quantity of power,with which government can subsist, to be the best.To those, who look abroad into the world, and attentivelyread the history of other nations, ancient andmodern, far different lessons are taught with a severetruth and force. Those lessons instruct them, thatenergy in the executive is a leading character in thedefinition of a good government. It is essential to theprotection of the community against foreign attacks.It is not less essential to the steady administration ofthe laws, to the protection of property against thoseirregular and high-handed combinations, which sometimesinterrupt the ordinary course of justice, and tothe security of liberty against the enterprises and assaultsof ambition, of faction, and of anarchy. Everyman the least conversant with Roman history knows,how often that republic was obliged to take refuge inthe absolute power of a single man, under the formidablename of a dictator, as w^ell against the intrigues ofambitious individuals, aspiring to tyranny, and the seditionof whole classes of the community, threateningthe existence of the government, as against foreignenemies, menacing the destruction and conquest of thestate. A feeble executive implies a feeble executionof the government. A feeble execution is but anotherphrase for a bad execution ; and a government ill executed,whatever may be its theory, must, in practice,be a bad government.518 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.^ 724. The ingredients, which constitute energy inthe executive, are unity, duration, an adequate provisionfor its support, and competent powers. The ingredients,which constitute safety in a republican formof government, are a due dependence on the people,and a due responsibility to the people.^ 725. That unity is conducive to energy willscarcely be disputed. Decision, activity, secresy, anddespatch weill generally characterise the proceedings ofone man in a much more eminent degree, than theproceedings of a greater number ; and in proportion,as the number is increased, these qualities will be diminished.^ 726. This unity may be destroyed in two ways ;first, by vesting the power in two or more magistratesof equal dignity ; secondly, by vesting it ostensibly inone man, subject, however, in whole or in part, to thecontrol and advice of a council. Of the first, the twoconsuls of Rome may serve, as an example in ancienttimes ; and in modern times, the brief and hasty historyof the three consuls of France, during its shortened republic.Of the latter, several states in the Union furnishexamples, as some of the colonies did before therevolution. Both these methods of destroying theunity of the executive have had their advocates.They are both liable to similar, if not to equal objections.^ 727. But independent of any of the lights derivedfrom history, it is obvious, that a division of the executivepower between two or more persons must alwaystend to produce dissensions, and fluctuating councils.Whenever two or more persons are engaged in anycommon enterprise, or pursuit, there is always dangerof difference of opinion. If it be a public trust, or office,ICH. XXXVI.] EXECUTIVE UNITY. 519in which they are clothed with equal dignity and authority,there are peculiar dangers arising from personalemulation, or personal animosity ; from superior talentson one side, encountering strong jealousies on the other; from pride of opinion on one side, and weak devotionto popular prejudices on the other; from thevanity of being the author of a plan, or resentment fromsome imagined slight by the approval of that of another.From these, aid other causes of the like nature, themost bitter rivalries and dissensions often spring. Wheneverthese happen, they lessen the respectability, weakenthe authority, and distract the plans and operationsof those whom they divide. The wisest measuresare thus often defeated, or delayed, even in the mostcritical moments. And what constitutes even a greaterevil, the community often becomes split up into rivalfactions, adhering to the different persons, who composethe magistracy ; and temporary animosities becomethus the foundation of permanent calamities tothe state. Indeed, the ruinous effects of rival factionsin free states, struggling for power, have been the constanttheme of reproach by the admirers of monarchy,and of regret by the lovers of republics. The Guelphand the Ghibelins, the white and the black factions, havebeen immortalized in the history of the Italian states ;and they are but an epitome of the same unvaryingscenes in all other republics.^ 728. Objections of a like nature apply, though insome respects with diminished force, to the scheme ofan executive council, whose constitutional concurrenceis rendered indispensable. An artful cabal in thatcouncil would be able to distract and enervate thewhole public councils. And even without such a cabal,the mere diversity of views and opinions would almost520 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.always mark the exercise of the executive authoritywith a spirit of habitual feebleness and dilatoriness, or adegrading inconsistency. But an objection, in a republicangovernment quite as weighty, is, that such a participationin the executive power has a direct tendencyto conceal faults, and destroy responsibility. Responsibilityis of two kinds, to censure, and to punishment.The first is the more important of the two, especially inan elective government. Men in public trust will moreoften act in such a manner, as to render themselves unworthyof public favour, than to render themselves liableto legal punishment. But the multiplication of voices inthe business of the executive renders it difficult to fixresponsibility of either kind ; for it is perpetually shiftedfrom one to another. It often becomes impossibleamidst mutual accusations to determine, upon whom theblame ought to rest. A sense of mutual improprietysometimes induces the parties to resort to plausible pretextsto disguise their misconduct ; or a dread of publicresponsibility to cover up, under the lead of somepopular demagogue, their own faults and vacillations. —Thus, a council often becomes the means, either ofshifting off all effective responsibility from the chiefmagistrate, or of intrigues and oppositions, which destroyhis power, and supplant his influence.§ 729. The proper conclusion to be drawn fromthese considerations is, that plurality in the executivedeprives the people of the two greatest securities for thefaithful exercise of delegated power. First, it removesthe just restraints of public opinion ; and, secondly, itdiminishes the means, as well as the power, of fixingresponsibility for bad measures upon the real authors.^ 730. The question as to the unity of the executivebeing disposed of, the next consideration is, as toCH. XXXVI.] Executive DURATION OF OFFICE. 621the proper duration of his term of office. It has beenalready mentioned, that duration in office constitutes anessential requisite to the energy of the executive department.This has relation to two objects ; first, thepersonal firmness of the chief magistrate in the employmentof his constitutional powers ; and, secondly, thestability of the system of administration, which may havebeen adopted under his auspices. With regard to thefirst, it is evident, that the longer the duration in office,the greater will be the probability of obtaining so importantan advantage. A man will naturally be interestedin whatever he possesses, in proportion to thefirmness or precariousness of the tenure, by which heholds it. He will be less attached to what he holds bya momentary, or uncertain title, than to what he enjoysby a title durable, or certain ; and of course he will bewilling to risk more for the one, than for the other.This remark is not less applicable to political privilege,or honour, or trust, than to any article of ordinary property.A chief magistrate, acting under the consciousness,that in a very short time he must lay down office,will be apt to feel himself too little interested in it tohazard any'material censure or perplexity from an independentexercise of his powers, or from those ill humours,which are apt at times to prevail in all governments.If the case should be, that he might, notwithstanding,be re-eligible, his wishes, if he should haveany for office, would combine with his fears to debasehis fortitude, or weaken his integrity, or enhance hisirresolution.§ 731. The other ground, that of stability in the systemof administration, is still more strikingly connectedwith duration in office. Few men will be found willingto commit themselves to a course of policy, whose .66522 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.dom may be perfectly clear to themselves, if they cannotbe permitted to complete, what they have begunwhat consequence will it be to form the best plansof executive administration, if they are perpetually passinginto new hands, before they are matured, or maybedefeated at the moment, when their reasonablenessand their value cannot be understood, or realized bythe public ? One of the truest rewards to patriots andstatesmen is the consciousness, that the objections raisedagainst their measures will disappear upon a fairtrial ; and that the gratitude and affection of the peoplewill follow their labours, long after they have ceased tobe actors upon the public scenes. But who will plant,when he can never reap ? Who will sacrifice his presentease, and reputation, and popularity, and encounterobloquy and persecution, for systems, which he canneither mould so, as to ensure success, nor direct so, asto justify the experiment ?^ 732. The natural result of a change of the headof the government will be a change in the course ofadministration, as well as a change in the subordinatepersons, who are to act as ministers to the executive.A successor in office will feel little sympathy withthe plans of his predecessor. To undo, what has beendone by the latter, will be supposed to give proofs ofhis own capacity ; and will recommend him to all those,who were adversaries of the past administration ; andperhaps will constitute the main grounds of elevatinghim to office. Personal pride, party principles, and anambition for public distinction will thus naturally prompthim to an abandonment of old schemes, and combinewith that love of novelty so congenial to all free states, tomake every new administration the founders of newsystems of government.CH. XXXVI.] EXECUTIVE DURATION OF OFFICE. 523§ 733. It is observable, that the period actuallyfixed is intermediate between the term of office of thesenate, and that of the house of representatives. In thecourse of one presidential term, the house is, or may be,twice re-composed ; and two-thirds of the senate changed,or re-elected. So far, as executive influence can bepresumed to operate upon either branch of the legislatureunfavourably to the rights of the people, the latterpossess, in their elective franchise, ample means of redress.On the other hand, so far, as uniformity andstability in the administration of executive duties aredesirable, they are in some measure secured by themore permanent tenure of office of the senate, whichwill check too hasty a departure from the old system,by a change of the executive, or representative branchof the government.§ 734. Hitherto our experience has demonstrated,that the period is not found practically so long, as tocreate danger to the people, or so short, as to takeaway a reasonable independence and energy from theexecutive. Still it cannot be disguised, that sufficienttime has scarcely yet elapsed to enable us to pronouncea decisive opinion upon the subject ; since the executivehas generally acted with a majority of the nation ; andin critical times he has been sustained by the force ofthat majority in strong measures, and in times of moretranquillity, by the general moderation of the policy ofhis administration.^ 735. Another question, connected with the durationof office of the president, was much agitated in theconvention, and has often since been a topic of seriousdiscussion ; and that is, whether he should be re-eligi-^able to office. In support of the opinion, that the presidentought to be ineligible after one period of office, it524 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.was urged, that the return of public officers into themass of the common people, There they would feel thetone, which they had given to the administration of thelaws, was the best security the public could have fortheir good behaviour. It would operate as a checkupon the restlessness of ambition, and at the same timepromote the independence of the executive. It wouldprevent him from a cringing subserviency to procure are-election ; or from a resort to corrupt intrigues for themaintenance of his power. And it was even added bysome, whose imaginations were continually haunted byterrors of all sorts from the existence of any powers inthe national government, that the re-eligibility of theexecutive would furnish an inducement to foreign governmentsto interfere in our elections, and would thusinflict upon us all the evils, which had desolated andbetrayed Poland.§ 736. In opposition to these suggestions it wasstated, that one ill effect of the exclusion would be adiminution of the inducements to good behaviour.There are few men, who would not feel much less zealin the discharge of a duty, when they were conscious,that the advantage of the station, with which it is connected,must be relinquished at a determinate period,than when they were permitted to entertain a hope ofobtaining by their merit a continuance of it. A desireof reward is one of the strongest incentives of humanconduct ; and the best security for the fidelity of mankindis to make interest coincide with duty. Anotherill effect of the exclusion would be the temptation tosordid views, to peculation, to the corrupt gratificationof favourites, and in some instances to usurpation. Aselfish or avaricious executive might, under such circumstances,be disposed to make the most he could forCH. Xxxvi.] EXECUTIVE RE-ELIGIBILITY. 525himself, and his friends, and partisans, during his briefcontinuance in office, and to introduce a system of officialpatronage aud emoluments, at war with the publicinterests, but well adapted to his own. If he were vainand ambitious, as well as avaricious and selfish, thetransient possession of his honors would depress theformer passions, and give new impulses to the latter.He would dread the loss of gain more, than the loss offame ; since the power must drop from his hands toosoon to ensure any substantial addition to his reputation.On the other hand, his very ambition, as well ashis avarice, might tempt him to usurpation ; since thechance of impeachment would scarcely be worthy ofthought ; and the present power of serving friendsmight easily surround him with advocates for everystretch of authority, which would flatter his vanity, oradminister to their necessities.^ 737. Another ill effect of the exclusion would be,depriving the community of the advantage of the experience,gained by an able chief magistrate in the exerciseof office. Experience is the parent of wisdom.And it would seem almost absurd to say, that it oughtsystematically to be excluded from the execute office.It would be equivalent to banishing merit from thepublic councils, because it had been tried. What couldbe more strange, than to declare, at the moment, whenwisdom was acquired, that the possessor of it should nolonger be enabled to use it for the very purposes, forwhich it was acquired ?^ 738. Another ill effect of the exclusion would be,that it might banish men from the station in certainemergencies, in which their services might be eminentlyuseful, and indeed almost indispensable for the safetyof their country. There is no nation, which has not, at526 CONSTITUTION OF THE (J. STATES. [eOOK III.some period or other in its history, felt an absolute necessityof the services of particular men in particularstations ; and, perhaps it is not too much to say, as vitalto the preservation of its political existence. In a timeof war, or other pressing calamity, the very confidenceof a nation in the tried integrity and ability of a singleman may of itself ensure a triumph. Is it wise to substitutein such cases inexperience for experience, andto set afloat public opinion, and change the settled courseof administration ? One should suppose, that it wouldbe sufficient to possess the right to change a bad magistrate,without making the singular merit of a good onethe very ground of excluding him from office.§ 739. It was added, that the advantages proposedby the exclusion, (1.) greater independence in the executive,(2.) greater security to the people, were notwell founded. The former could not be attained in anymoderate degree, unless the exclusion was made perpetual.And, if it were, there might be many motivesto induce the executive to sacrifice his independence tofriends, to partisans, to selfish objects, and private gain,to the fear of enemies, and the desire to stand well withmajorities. As to the latter supposed advantage, theexclusion would operate no check upon a man of irregularambition, or corrupt principles, and against suchmen alone could the exclusion be important. In truth,such men would easily find means to cover up theirusurpations and dishonesty under fair pretensions, andmean subserviency to popular prejudices. They wouldeasily delude the people into a belief, that their actswere constitutional, because they were in harmony withthe public wishes, or held out some specious, but falseprojects for the public good.CH. XXXVI.] EXECUTIVE Vice-president. 527^ 740. Still it must be confessed, that where theduration is for a considerable length of time, the rightof re-election becomes less important, and perhaps lesssafe to the public. A president chosen for ten yearsmight be made ineligible with far less impropriety, thanone chosen for four years. And a president chosenfor twenty years ought not to be again eligible, uponthe plain ground, that by such a term of office his responsibilitywould be greatly diminished, and his meansof influence and patronage immensely increased, so asto check in a great measure the just expression ofpublic opinion, and the free exercise of the electivefranchise.§ 741. The remaining part of the clause respectsthe Vice-president. If such an officer was to be created,it is plain, that the duration of his office shouldbe co-extensive with that of the president. Indeed, aswe shall immediately see, the scheme of the governmentnecessarily embraced it ; for when it was decided,that two persons were to be voted for, as president,it was decided, that he, who had the greatest numberof votes of the electors, after the person chosen as president,should be vice-president. The principal question,therefore, was, whether such an officer ought to becreated.^ 742. The reasons in favour of the appointmentwere as follows. It was seen, that a presiding officermust be chosen for the senate, where all the states wereequally represented, ai;id where an extreme jealousymight naturally be presumed to exist of the preponderatinginfluence of any one state. If a member of thesenate were appointed, either the state would be deprivedof one vote, or would enjoy a double vote incaseof an equality of votes, or there would be a tie.528 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.and no decision. Each of these alternatives wasequally undesirable, and might lay the foundation ofgreat practical inconveniences. An officer, therefore,chosen by the whole Union, would be a more suitableperson to preside, and give a casting vote, since hewould be more free, than any member of the senate,from local attachments, and local interests ; and beingthe representative of the Union, would naturally beinduced to consult the interests of all the states.Having only a casting vote, his influence could onlyoperate exactly, w^hen most beneficial ; that is, to procurea decision. A still more important considerationis the necessity of providing some suitable person toperform the executive functions, when the presidentis unable to perform them, or is removed from office.Every reason, which recommends the mode ofelection of the president, prescribed by the constitution,with a view either to dignity, independence, orpersonal qualifications for office, applies with equalforce to the appointment of his substitute. ,He is toperform the same duties, and to possess the samerights ; and it seems, if not indispensable, at least peculiarlyproper, that the choice of the person, whoshould succeed to the executive functions, should belongto the people at large, rather than to a select bodychosen for another purpose. If (as was suggested)the president of the senate, chosen by that body, mighthave been designated, as the constitutional substitute ;it is by no means certain, that he would either possessso high qualifications, or enjoy so much public confidence,or feel so much responsibility for his conduct, asavice-president selected directly by and from the people.The president of the senate would generally beselected from other motives, and with reference tooth.XXXVI.] EXECUTIVE-choice OF PRESIDENT. 529er qualifications, than what ordinarily belonged to theexecutive department. His political opinions might bein marked contrast with those of a majority of the nation; and while he might possess a just influence in thesenate, as a presiding officer, he might be deemedwholly unfit for the various duties of the chief executivemagistrate. In addition to these considerations,there was no novelty in the appointment of such anofficer for similar purposes in some of the state governments; and it therefore came recommended by experience,as a safe and useful arrangement, to guard thepeople against the inconveniences of an interregnum inthe government, or a devolution of power upon an officer,who was not their choice, and might not possesstheir confidence.§ 743. The next clause embraces the mode of electionof the President and Vice-president ; and althoughit has been repealed by an amendment of the constitution,(as will be hereafter shown,) yet it still deservesconsideration, as a part of the original scheme, and moreespecially, as very grave doubts have been entertained,whether the substitute is not inferior to it in wisdom andconvenience.^ 744. The clause is as follows : " Each state shallappoint in such manner, as the legislature thereof maydirect, a number of electors, equal to the whole numberof senators and representatives, to which the"state may be entitled in the congress. But no senator,or representative, or person holding an office of"trust or profit under the United States, shall be appointedan elector.The electors shall meet in their respective states,and vote by ballot for two persons, of whom one atleast shall not be an inhabitant of the same state withAbr. 67530 CONSTITUTION OF THE V. STATES. [bOOK III,themselves. And they shall make a list of all thepersons voted for, and of the number of votes for each ;which list they shall sign and certify, and transmit,sealed, to the seat of the government of the UnitedStates, directed to the president of the senate. The** president of the senate shall, in the presence of thesenate and house of representatives, open all the certificates,and the votes shall then be counted. Theperson having the greatest number of votes shall bethepresident, if such number be a majority of thevs^hole number of electors appointed ; and if there bemore than ore, who have such majority, and have anequal number of votes, then the house of representativesshall immediately choose by ballot one of themfor president ; and if no person have a majority, then"from the five highest on the hist the said house shallin like manner choose the president. But in choosingthe president, the votes shall be taken by states,** the representation from each state having one vote ;"a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a memberor members from two-thirds of the states, and a majorityof all the states shall be necessary to a choice.In every case, after the choice of the president, the"person having the greatest number of votes of the"electors shall be the vice-president. But if thereshould remain two or more, who have equal votes,the senate shall choose from them by ballot the vice-president."^ 745. Assuming that the choice ought not to be confidedto the national legislature, (which was at one timeproposed, and after deliberation rejected,) there remainedvarious other modes, by which it might be effected ;by the people directly ; by the state legislatures ; or byelectors, chosen by the one, or the other. The latterCH. XXXVI.] EXECUTIVE-choice OF PRESIDENT. 631mode was deemed most advisable; and the reasoning, bywhich it was supported, was to the following effect. Theimmediate election should be made by men, the mostcapable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station,and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation,and to a judicious combination of all the inducements,which ought to govern their choice. A smallnumber of persons, selected by their fellow citizensfrom the general mass for this special object, would bemost likely to possess the information, and discernment,and independence, essential" for the proper discharge ofthe duty. It is also highly important to afford as littleopportunity, as possible, to tumult and disorder. Theseevils are not unlikely to occur in the election of a chiefmagistrate directly by the people, considering the strongexcitements and interests, which such an occasion maynaturally be presumed to produce. The choice of anumber of persons, to form an intermediate body ofelectors, would be far less apt to convulse the communitywith any extraordinary or violent movements, thanthe choice of one, who was himself the final object ofthe public wishes. And as the electors chosen in eachstate are to assemble, and vote in the state, in whichthey are chosen, this detached and divided situationwould expose them much less to heats and ferments,which might be communicated from them to the people,than if they were all convened at one time in one place.The same circumstances would naturally lessen thedangers of cabal, intrigue, and corruption, especially, ifcongress should, as they undoubtedly would, prescribethe same day for the choice of the electors, and forgivingtheir votes, throughout the United States. Thescheme, indeed, presents every reasonable guardagainst these fatal evils to republican governments.532 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.The appointment of the president is not made to dependupon any pre-existing body of men, who mightbe tampered with beforehand to prostitute their votes ;but is delegated to persons chosen by the immediateact of the people, for that sole and temporary purpose.All those persons, who, from their situation, might besuspected of too great a devotion to the president inoffice, such as senators, and representatives, and otherpersons holding offices of trust or profit under the UnitedStates, are excluded from eligibility to the trust.Thus, without corrupting the body of the people, theimmediate agents in the election may fairly be presumedto enter upon their duty free from any sinister bias.Their transitory existence and dispersed situation wouldpresent formidable obstacles to any corrupt combinations; and time, as well as means, would be wanting toaccomplish, by bribery or intrigue of any considerablenumber, a betrayal of their duty. The president, too,who should be thus appointed, would be far more independent,than if chosen by a legislative body, to whomhe might be expected to make correspondent sacrifices,to gratify their wishes, or reward their services. Andon the other hand, being chosen by the voice of thepeople, his gratitude would take the natural direction,and sedulously guard their rights.^ 746. The other parts of the scheme are no lessentitled to commendation. The number of electors isequal to the number of senators and representatives ofeach state ; thus giving to each state as virtual a representationin the electoral colleges, as that, which it enjoysin congress. The votes, when given, are to betransmitted to the seat of the national government, andthere opened and counted in the presence of bothhouses. The person, having a majority of the wholeCH. XXXVI.] EXECUTIVE-choice OF PRESIDENT. 533number of votes, is to be president. But, if no one ofthe candidates has such a majority, then the house ofrepresentatives, the popular branch of the government,is to elect, from the five highest on the list, the person,whom they may deem best qualified for the office, eachstate having one vote in the choice. The person, whohas the next highest number of votes after the choiceof president, is to be vice-president. But, if two ormore shall have equal votes, the senate are to choosethe vice-president. Thus, the ultimate functions are tobe shared alternately by the senate and representativesin the organization of the executive department.^ 747. The principal difficulty, which has been feltin the mode of election, is the constant tendency, fromthe number of candidates, to bring the choice into thehouse of representatives. This has already occurredtwice in the progress of the government ; and in thefuture there is every probability of a far more frequentoccurrence. This was early foreseen ; and, even inone of the state conventions, a most distinguished statesman,and one of the framers of the constitution, admitted,that it would probably be found impracticable toelect a president by the immediate suffrages of thepeople ; and that in so large a country many personswould probably be voted for, and that the lowest of thefive highest on the fist might not have an inconsiderablenumber of votes. It cannot escape the discernmentof any attentive observer, that if the house ofrepresentatives is often to choose a president, thechoice will, or at least may, be influenced by manymotives, independent of his merits and qualifications.There is danger, that intrigue and cabal may mix inthe rivalries and strife. And the discords, if notthe corruptions, generated by the occasion, will probeCONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.ably long outlive the immediate choice, and scatter theirpestilential influences over all the great interests of thecountry. One fearful crisis was passed in the choiceof Mr. Jefferson over his competitor, Mr. Burr, in 1801,which threatened a dissolution of the government, andput the issue upon the tried patriotism of one or twoindividuals, who yielded from a sense of duty theirpreference of the candidate, generally supported by theirfriends.^ 748. The issue of the contest of 1801 gave riseto an amendment of the constitution materially changingin several respects, the mode of election of president.In the first place it provides, that the ballots of the electorsshall be separately given for president and vice-president,instead of one ballot for two persons, aspresident ; that the vice-president (like the president)shall be chosen by a majority of the whole number ofelectors appointed ; that the number of candidates, outof whom the selection of president is to be made bythe house of representatives, shall be three, instead offive ; that the senate shall choose the vice-presidentfrom the two highest numbers on the list ; and that, ifno choice is made of president before the fourth ofMarch following, the vice-president shall act as president.^ 749. The amendment was proposed in October,1803, and was ratified before September, 1804, and isin the following terms.The electors shall meet in their respective states,« and vote by ballot for president and vice-president,« one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant ofthe same state with themselves ; they shall name intheir ballots the person voted for as president, and in« distinct ballots the person voted'for as vice-president ;« and they shall make distinct lists of all persons votedCH. XXXVI.] EXECUTIVE-choice OF PRESIDENT. 536for as president, and of all persons voted for as vice-president,and of the number of votes for each ; whichlists they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed"to the seat of government of the United States;directed to the president of the senate. The presidentof the senate shall, in the presence of the senateand house of representatives, open all the certificates,and the votes shall then be counted. The person havingthe greatest number of votes for president shallbe the president, if such number be a majority of thewhole number of electors appointed ; and if no personhave such majority, then from the persons havingthe highest numbers, not exceeding three, on the listof those voted for as president, the house of representativesshall choose immediately, by ballot, the"president. But in choosing the president, the votesshall be taken by states, the representation from each"state having one vote; a quorum for this purpose"shall consist of a member, or members, from two-thirdsof the states ; and a majority of all the statesshall be necessary to a choice. And if the house ofrepresentatives shall not choose a president, wheneverthe right of choice shall devolve upon them, beforethe fourth day of March next following, then the vice-presidentshall act as president, as in the case of thedeath or other constitutional disability of the president.The person, having the greatest number of votesas vice-president, shall be the vice-president, if such"number be a majority of the whole number of electorsappointed ; and if no person have a majority,then from the two highest numbers on the list, thesenate shall choose the vice-president ; a quorum forthe purpose shall consist of two-thirds of the whole536 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III."number of senators, and a majority of the whole"number shall be necessary to a choice."But no person, constitutionally ineligible to the"office of president, shall be eligible to that of vice-presidentof the United States."§ 750. This amendment has alternately been thesubject of praise and blame, and experience alone candecide, whether the changes proposed by it are in allrespects for the better, or the worse. In some respectsit is a substantial improvement. In the first place,under the original mode, the senate was restrainedfrom acting, until the house of representatives had madetheir selection, which, if parties ran high, might beconsiderably delayed. By the amendment the senatemay proceed to a choice of the vice-president, immediatelyon ascertaining the returns of the votes. Inthe next place, under the original mode, if no choiceshould be made of a president by the house of representativesuntil after the expiration of the term of thepreceding officer, there would be no person to performthe functions of the office, and an interregnum wouldensue, and a total suspension of the powers of government.By the amendment, the new vice-presidentwould in such case act as president. By the originalmode, the senate are to elect the vice-president byballot ; by the amendment, the mode of choice is leftopen, so that it may be viva voce. Whether this beanimprovement, or not, may be doubted.^751. On the other hand, the amendment hascertainly greatly diminished the dignity and importanceof the office of vice-president. Though the dutiesremain the same, he is no longer a competitor for thepresidency, and selected, as possessing equal merit,talents, and qualifications, with the other candidate.CH. XXXVI.] EXECUTIVE-choice OF PRESIDENT. 537As every state was originally compelled to vote for twocandidates (one of whom did not belong to the state)for the same office, a choice was fairly given to all otherstates to select between them ; thus excluding theabsolute predominance of any local interest, or localpartiality.^ 752. It is observable, that the language of theconstitution is, that " each state shall appoint in such"manner, as the legislature thereof may direct," thenumber of electors, to which the state is entitled. Underthis authority the appointment of electors has beenvariously provided for by the state legislatures. Insome states the legislature have directly chosen theelectors by themselves ; in others they have been chosenby the people by a general ticket throughout thewhole state ; and in others by the people in electoraldistricts, fixed by the legislature, a certain number ofelectors being apportioned to each district. No questionhas ever arisen, as to the consdtudonality of eithermode, except that of a direct choice by the legislature.But this, though often doubted by able and ingeniousminds, has been firmly established in practice, eversince the adoption of the constitution, and does notnow seem to admit of controversy, even if a suitabletribunal existed to adjudicate upon it. At present, innearly all the states, the electors are chosen either bythe people by a general ticket, or by the state legislature.The choice in districts has been graduallyabandoned; and is now persevered in, but by twostates. The inequality of this mode of choice, unlessit should become general throughout the Union, isso obvious, that it is rather matter of surprise, that itshould not long since have been wholly abandoned. Incaseof any party divisions in a state, it may neutralizeAbr. 68638 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.its whole vote, while all the other states give an unbrokenelectoral vote. On this account, and for thesake of uniformity, it has been thought desirable bymany statesmen to have the constitution amended so, asto provide for an uniform mode of choice by the people.§ 753. The remaining part of the clause, whichprecludes any senator, representative, or person holdingan office of trust or profit under the United States,from being an elector, has been already alluded to, andrequires Httle comment. The object is, to preventpersons, holding public stations under the governmentof the United States, from any direct influence in thechoice of a president. In respect to persons holdingoffice, it is reasonable to suppose, that their partialitieswould all be in favour of the ree-election of the actualincumbent, and they might have strong inducementsto exert their official influence in the electoral college.In respect to senators and representatives, there is thisadditional reason for excluding them, that they would bealready committed by their vote in the electoral college; and thus, if there should be no election by thepeople, they could not bring to the final vote either theimpartiality, or the independence, which the theory ofthe constitution contemplates.^ 754. The next clause is, " The congress maydetermine the time of choosing the electors, and theday, on which they shall give their votes, which dayshall be the same throughout the United States."^ 755. The propriety of this power would seem tobe almost self-evident. Every reason of public policyand convenience seems in favour of a fixed time ofgiving: the electoral votes, and that it should be thesame throughout the Union. Such a measure is calculatedto repress political intrigues and speculations,CH. XXXVI.] EXECUTIVE TIME OF ELECTING. 539by rendering a combination among the electoral colleges,as to their votes, if not utterly impracticable, atleast very difficult; and thus secures the people againstthose ready expedients, which corruption never f?iils toemploy to accomplish its designs. The arts of ambitionare thus in some degree checked, and the independenceof the electors against external influence insome degree secured. This power, however, did notescape objection in the general, or the state conventions,though the objection was not extensively insisted on.§ 756. In pursuance of the authority given by thisclause, congress, in 1792, passed an act declaring, thatthe electors shall be appointed in each state withinthirty-four days, preceding the first Wednesday in Decemberin every fourth year, succeeding the last electionof president, according to the apportionment ofrepresentatives and senators then existing. The electorschosen are required to meet and give their votes onthe said first Wednesday of December, at such place ineach state, as shall be directed by the legislature thereof.They are then to make and sign three certificatesof all the votes by them given, and to seal up the same,certifying on each, that a fist of the votes of such statefor president and vice-president is contained therein,and are to appoint a person to take charge of, and denver,one of the same certificates to the president of the senateat the seat of government, before the first Wednesdayof January then next ensuing ; another of the certificatesis to be forwarded forthwith by the post-oflSce tothe president of the senate at the seat of government ;and the third is to be delivered to the judge of the district,in which the electors assembled. Other auxiliaryprovisions are made by the same act for the due transmissionand preservation of the electoral votes, and540 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK IIJ.authenticating the appointment of the electors Thepresident's term of office is also declared to commenceon the fourth day of March next succeeding the day,on which the votes of the electors shall be given.^ 757. The next clause respects the qualifications ofthe president of the United States. " No person,"except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of theUnited States at the time of the adoption of this constitution,shall be eligible to the office of president."Neither shall any person be eligible to that office,"who shall not have attained to the age of thirty-five"years, and been fourteen years a resident within the"United States."^ 758. Considering the nature of the duties, theextent of the information, and the solid wisdom andexperience required in the executive department, noone can reasonably doubt the propriety of some qualificationof age. That, which has been selected, is themiddle age of fife, by which period the character andtalents of individuals are generally known, and fully developed; and opportunities have usually been affordedfor public service, and for experience in the publiccouncils. The faculties of the mind, if they have notthen attained to their highest maturity, are in full vigour,and hastening towards their ripest state. Thejudgment, acting upon large materials, has, by thattime, attained a solid cast ; and the principles, whichform the character, and the integrity, which gives lustreto the virtues of Use, must then, if ever, have acquiredpublic confidence and approbation.§ 759. It is indispensable, too, that the presidentshould be a natural born citizen of the United States,or a citizen at the adoption of the constitution, and forfourteen years before his election. This permission of aCH. XXXVI.] EXECUTIVE QUALIFICATIONS. 541naturalized citizen to become president is an exceptionfrom the great fundamental policy of all governments,to exclude foreign influence from their executivecouncils and duties. It was doubtless introduced (for itha now become by lapse of time merely nominal, andwill soon become wholly extinct) out of respect tothose distinguished revolutionary patriots, who wereborn in a foreign land, and yet had entided themselvesto high honours in their adopted country. A positiveexclusion of them from the office would have been unjustto their merits, and painful to their sensibilities.But the general propriety of the exclusion of foreigners,in common cases, will scarcely be doubted by any soundstatesman. It cuts off all chances for' ambitious foreigners,who might otherwise be intriguing for theoffice ; and interposes a barrier against those corruptinterferences of foreign governments in executive elections,which have inflicted the most serious evils upon theelective monarchies of Europe. Germany, Poland, andeven the pontificate of Rome, are sad, but instructiveexamples of the enduring mischiefs arising from thissource. A residence of fourteen years in the UnitedStates is also made an indispensable requisite for everycandidate ; so, that the people may have a full opportunityto know his character and merits, and that hemay have mingled in the duties, and felt the interests,and understood the principles, and nourished the attachments,belonging, to every citizen in a republican government.By "residence," in the constitution, is to beunderstood, not an absolute inhabitancy within theUnited States during the whole period ; but such aninhabitancy, as includes a permanent domicil in theUnited States. No one has supposed, that a temporaryabsence abroad on public business, and especially542 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.on an embassy to a foreign nation, would interrupt theresidence of a citizen, so as to disqualify him foroffice. If the word were to be construed with suchstrictness, then a mere journey through any foreignadjacent territory for health, or for pleasure, or a commonlythere for a single day, would amount to a disqualification.Under such a construction a military orcivil officer, who should have been in Canada duringthe late war on public business, would have lost hiseligibility. The true sense of residence in the constitutionis fixed domicil, or being out of the United States,and seeded abroad for the purpose of general inhabitancy,animo manendi^ and not for a mere temporaryand fugitive purpose, in transitu,§ 760. The next clause is, "In case of the removal"of the president from office, or his death, resignation,or inability to discharge the duties of the said office,the same shall devolve on the vice-president. Andthe congress may by law provide for the case of removal,death, resignation, or inability of the presidentand vice-president, declaring what officer shall thenact as president ; and such officer shall act accordingly,until the disability be removed, or a presidentshall be elected."^761. The original scheme of the constitution didnot embrace (as has been already stated) the appointmentof any vice-president ; and in case of the death,resignation, or disability of the president, the presidentof the senate was to perform the duties of his office.The appointment of a vice-president was carried by avote of ten states to one. Congress, in pursuance ofthe power here given, have provided, that in case ofthe removal, death, resignation, or inability of the presidentand vice-president, the president of the senateCH. XXXVI.] EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. 643pro tempore, and in case there shall be no president,then the speaker of the house of representatives for thetime being shall act as president, until the disability beremoved, or a president shall be elected.^ 762. What shall be the proper proof of the resignationof the president, or vice-president, or of theirrefusal to accept the office, is left open by the constitution.But congress, with great wisdom and forecast,have provided, that it shall be by some instrumentin writing, declaring the same, subscribed by theparty, and delivered into the office of the secretaryof state.^ 763. The next clause is, " The president shall, at"stated times, receive for his services a compensation,which shall neither be increased, nor diminishedduring the period, for which he shall have beenelected, and he shall not receive within that periodany other emolument from the United States, or any"of them."^ 764, It is obvious, that without due attention tothe proper support of the president, the separationof the executive from the legislative department wouldbe merely nominal and nugatory. The legislature, witha discretionary power over his salary and emolument,would soon render him obsequious to their will. Acontrol over a man's living is in most cases a controlover his actions. To act upon any other view of thesubject would be to disregard the voice of experience,and the operation of the invariable principles, whichregulate human conduct. There are, indeed, men,who could neither be distressed, nor won into a sacrificeof their duty. But this stern virtue is the growthof few soils ; and it will be found, that the general lessonof human life is, that men obey their interests ;544 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.that they may be driven by poverty into base compliances,or tempted by largesses to a desertion of duty.Nor have there been wanting examples in our owncountry of the intimidation, or seduction of the executive,by the terrors or allurements of the pecuniaryarrangements of the legislative body. The wisdomof this clause can scarcely be too highly commended.The legislature, on the appointment of a president, isonce for all to declare, what shall be the compensationfor his services during the time, for which he shall havebeen elected. This done, they will have no power toalter it, either by increase or diminution, until a newperiod of service by a new election commences. Theycan neither weaken his fortitude by operating upon hisnecessities, nor corrupt his integrity by appealing to hisavarice. Neither the Union, nor any of its members,will be at liberty to give, nor will he be at Liberty to receive,any other emolument. He can, of course, haveno pecuniary inducement to renounce, or desert, the independenceintended for him by the constitution. Thesalary of the first president was fixed by congress at thesum of twenty-five thousand dollars per annum, and ofthe vice-president, at five thousand dollars. And toprevent any difficulty, as to future presidents, congress,by a permanent act, a few years afterwards establishedthe same compensation for all future presidents andvice-presidents. So that, unless some great changesshould intervene, the independence of the executive ispermanently secured by an adequate maintenance ;and it can scarcely be diminished, unless some futureexecutive shall basely betray his duty to his successor.^ 765. The next clause is, "Before he enters onthe execution of his office, he shall take the followingoath or affirmation : I do solemnly swear, (or affirm,)CH. XXXVI.] EXECUTIVE OATH. 545that I will faithfully execute the office of President of"the United States, and will, to the best of my ability,preserve, protect, and defend the constitution of the« United States."^ 765. There is little need of commentary uponthis clause. No man can well doubt the propriety ofplacing a president of the United States under themost solemn obligations to preserve, protect, and defendthe constitution. It is a suitable pledge of hisfidelity and responsibility to his country ; and createsupon his conscience a deep sense of duty, by an appeal,at once in the presence of God and man, to the mostsacred and solemn sanctions, which can operate uponthe human mind.Abr.646 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK IIICHAPTER XxxviEXECUTIVE POWERS AND DUTIES.§ 766. Having thus considered the manner, inwhich the executive department is organized, thenext inquiry is, as to the powers, with which it is entrusted.These, and the corresponding duties, areenumerated in the second and third sections of thesecond article of the constitution.^ 767. The first clause of the second section is,The President shall be commander-in-chief of the'' army and navy of the United States, and of themilitia of the several states, when called into theactual service of the United States. He may requirethe opinion in writing of the principal officerin each of the executive departments, upon anysubject relating to the duties of their respectiveoffices. And he shall have power to grant reprievesand pardons for offences against the UnitedStates, except in cases of impeachment."^ 768. The command and application of the publicforce, to execute the laws, to maintain peace, andto resist foreign invasion, are powers so obviously ofan executive nature, and require the exercise of qualitiesso peculiarly adapted to this department, that awell-organized government can scarcely exist, whenthey are taken away from it. Of all the cases andconcerns of government, the direction of war mostpeculiarly demands those qualities, which distinguishthe exercise of power by a single hand. Unity ofplan, promptitude, activity, and decision, are indispensableto success ; and these can scarcely exist, exceptCH. XXXVII.] EXECUTIVE POWERS. 547when a single magistrate is entrusted exclusively withthe power. Even the coupling of the authority of anexecutive council with him, in the exercise of suchpowers, enfeebles the system, divides the responsibility,and not unfrequently defeats every energetic measure.Timidity, indecision, obstinacy, and pride ofopinion, must mingle in all such councils, and infuse atorpor and sluggishness, destructive of all militaryoperations. Indeed, there would seem to be littlereason to enforce the propriety of giving this powerto the executive department, (whatever may be itsactual organization,) since it is in exact coincidencewith the provisions of our. state constitutions ; andtherefore seems to be universally deemed safe, if notvital to the system.^ 769. The next provision is, as to the power ofthe president, to require the opinions in writing of theheads of the executive departments. It has been remarked,that this is a mere redundancy, and the rightwould result from the very nature of the office. Still,it is not without use, as it imposes a more strict responsibility,and recognises a public duty of high importanceand value in critical times. It has, in theprogress of the government, been repeatedly actedupon ; but by no president with more wisdom andpropriety, than by President Washington.§ 770. The next power is, " to grant reprieves andpardons." It has been said by the marquis Beccaria,that the power of pardon does not exist under a perfectadministration of the laws ; and that the admissionof the power is a tacit acknowledgment of the infirmityof the course of justice. But if this be a defect at all,it arises from the infirmity of human nature generally ;and in this view, is no more objectionable, than anyCONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.Other power of government ; for every such powder, insome sort, arises from human infirmity. But if it bemeant, that it is an imperfection in human legislationto admit the power of pardon in any case, the propositionmay well be denied, and some proof, at least,be required of its sober reality. The common argumentis, that where punishments are mild, they oughtto be certain ; and that the clemency of the chiefmagistrate is a tacit disapprobation of the laws. Butsurely no man in his senses will contend, that any systemof laws can provide for every possible shade ofguilt a proportionate degree of punishment. The most,that ever has been, and ever can be done, is to providefor the punishment of crimes by some general rules,and within some general limitations i The total exclusionof all power of pardon would necessarily introducea very dangerous power in judges and juries, offollowing the spirit, rather than the letter of the laws ;or, out of humanity, of suffering real offenders whollyto escape punishment; or else, it must be holden,(what no man will seriously avow,) that the situationand circumstances of the offender, though they alternot the essence of the offence, ought to make no distinctionin the punishment. There are not only variousgradations of guilt in the commission of the samecrime, which are not susceptible of any previous enumerationand definition ; but the proofs must, in manycases, be imperfect in their own nature, not only asto the actual commission of the offence, but also as tothe aggravating or mitigating circumstances. In manycases, convictions must be founded upon presumptionsand probabilities. Would it not be at once unjust andunreasonable to exclude all means of mitigating punishment,when subsequent inquiries should demonstrate.CH. XXXVII.] EXECUTIVE — POWERS. 649that the accusation was wholly unfounded, or thecrime greatly diminished in point of atrocity and aggravation,from what the evidence at the trial seemedto establish ? A power to pardon seems, indeed, indispensableunder the most common administration ofthe law by human tribunals ; since, otherwise, menwould sometimes fall a prey to the vindictiveness ofaccusers, the inaccuracy of testimony, and the fallibilityof jurors and courts. Besides ; the law may hebroken, and yet the offender be placed in such circumstances,that he will stand, in a great measure, andperhaps wholly, excused in moral and general justice,though not in the strictness of the law. What then isto be done ? Is he to be acquitted against the law ;or convicted, and to suffer punishment infinitely beyondhis deserts ? If an arbitrary power is to begiven to meet such cases, where can it be so properlylodged, as in the executive department ?§ 771. So far from the power of pardon being incompatiblewith the fundamental principles of a republic,(as has sometimes been stated) it may be boldlyasserted to be peculiarly appropriate, and safe in allfree states ; because the power can there be guardedby a just responsibility for its exercise. Little roomwill be left for favouritism, personal caprice, or personalresentment. If the power should ever beabused, it would be far less likely to occur in opposition,than in obedience to the will of the people.The danger is not, that in republics the victims of thelaw will too often escape punishment by a pardon ;but that the power will not be sufficiently exerted incases, where public feeling accompanies the prosecution,and assigns the ultimate doom to persons, whohave been convicted upon slender testimony, or popularsuspicions.550 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.§ 772. The power to pardon, then, being a fit oneto be entrusted to all governments, humanity andsound policy dictate, that this benign prerogativeshould be, as little as possible, fettered, or embarrassed.The criminal code of every country partakes somuch of necessary severity, that, without an easy accessto exceptions in favour of unfortunate guilt, justicewould assume an aspect too sanguinary and cruel.The only question is, in what department of the governmentit can be most safely lodged ; and that mustprincipally refer to the executive, or legislative department.The reasoning in favour of vesting it inthe executive department may be thus stated. Asense of responsibility is always strongest in proportion,as it is undivided. A single 'person would,therefore, be most ready to attend to the force ofthose motives, which might plead for a mitigation ofthe rigour of the law ; and the least apt to yield toconsiderations, which were calculated to shelter a fitobject of its vengeance. The consciousness, that thelife, or happiness of an offender was exclusively withinhis discretion, would inspire scrupulousness and caution; and the dread of being accused of weakness, orconnivance, would beget circumspection of a differentsort. On the other hand, as men generally deriveconfidence from numbers, a large assembly might naturallyencourage each other in acts of obduracy, as noone would feel much apprehension of public censure.A public body, too, ordinarily engaged in other duties,would be little apt to sift cases of this sort thoroughlyto the bottom, and would be disposed to yield to thesolicitations, or be guided by the prejudices of a few ;and thus shelter their own acts of yielding too much,or too little, under the common apology of ignorance.CH. XXXVII.] EXECUTIVE POWERS. - 561or confidence. A single magistrate would be compelledto search, and act upon his own responsibility ;and therefore would be at once a more enlighteneddispenser of mercy, and a more firm administrator ofpublic justice.^ 773. There is an exception to the powder of pardon,that it shall not extend to cases of impeachment,which takes from the president every temptation toabuse it in cases of political and official offences bypersons in the public service. The power of impeachmentwill generally be applied to persons holding highoffices under the government ; and it is of great consequence,that the president should not have the powerof preventing a thorough investigation of their conductorof securing them against the disgrace of a publicconviction by impeachment, if they should deserve it.The constitution has, therefore, wisely interposed thischeck upon his power, so that he cannot, by any corruptcoalition with favourites, or dependents in highoffices, screen them from punishment.^ 774. It would seem to result from the principle,on which the power of each branch of the legislatureto punish for contempts is founded, that the executiveauthority cannot interpose between them and the offender.The main object is to secure a purity, independence,and ability of the legislature, adequate to thedischarge of all their duties. If they can be overawedby force, or corrupted by largesses, or interrupted intheir proceedings by violence, without the means ofself-protection, it is obvious, that they will soon befound incapable of legislating with wisdom or independence.If the executive should possess the powerof pardoning any such offender, they would be whollydependent upon his good will and pleasure for the CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.excise of their own powers. Thus, in effect, the rightsof the people entrusted to them would be placed inperpetual jeopardy. The constitution is silent in respectto the right of granting pardons in such cases, asit is in respect to the jurisdiction to punish for contempts.The latter arises by implication ; and to makeit effectual the former is excluded by implication.^ 775. Subject to these exceptions, (and perhapsthere may be others of a like nature standing uponspecial grounds,) the power of pardon is general andunqualified, reaching from the highest to the lowestoffences. The power of remission of fines, penalties,and forfeitures is also included in it ; and may in thelast resort be exercised by the executive, although itis in many cases by our laws confided to the treasurydepartment. No law can abridge the constitutionalpowers of the executive department, or interrupt itsright to interpose by pardon in such cases.^ 776. The next clause is : " He (the president)shall have power, by and with the advice and consentof the senate, to make treaties, provided two thirdsof the senators present concur. And he shall nominate,and, by and with the advice and consent ofthe senate, shall appoint, ambassadors, other publicministers, and consuls, judges of the Supreme Court,and all other officers of the United States, whoseappointments are not herein otherwise provided for,and which shall be established by law. But the'' congress may by law vest the appointment of suchinferior officers, as they think proper, in the presidentalone, in the courts of law, or in the heads ofdepartments."^ 777. The power " to make treaties " is by theconstitution general ; and of course it embraces allCH. XXXVII.] EXECUTIVE POWERS. 553sorts of treaties, for peace or war ; for commerce orterritory ; for alliance or succours ; for indemnity forinjuries or payment of debts ; for the recognition orenforcement of principles of public law ; and for anyother purposes, which the policy or interests of independentsovereigns may dictate in their intercoursewith each other. But, though the power is thus generaland unrestricted, it is not to be so construed, asto destroy the fundamental laws of the state. Apower given by the constitution cannot be construed toauthorize a destruction of other powers given in thesame instrument. It must be construed, therefore, insubordinationto it ; and cannot supersede, or interferewith any other of its fundamental provisions. Eachis equally obligatory, and of paramount authoritywithin its scope ; and no one embraces a right to annihilateany other. A treaty to change the organizationof the government, to annihilate its sovereignty,to overturn its republican form, or to deprive it of itsconstitutional powers, would be void ; because it woulddestroy, what it was designed merely to fulfil, the willof the people. Whether there are any other restrictions,necessarily growing out of the structure of thegovernment, will remain to be considered, wheneverthe exigency shall arise.§ 778. The power of making treaties is indispensableto the due exercise of national sovereignty, andvery important, especially as it relates to war, peace,aid commerce. That it should belong to the nationalgovernment would seem to be irresistibly establishedby every argument deduced from experience, frompublic policy, and a close survey of the objects of government.It is difficult to circumscribe the powerwithin any definite limits, applicable to all times andAbr. 70554 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.exigencies, without impairing its efficacy, or defeatingits purposes. The constitution has, therefore, made itgeneral and unqualified. This very circumstance,however, renders it highly important, that it shouldbe delegated in such a mode, and with such precautions,as will afford the highest security, that it willbe exercised by men the best qualified for the purpose,and in the manner most conducive to the public good.With such views, the question was naturally presentedin the convention, to what body shall it be delegated ?It might be delegated to congress generally, as it wasunder the confederation, exclusive of the president,or in conjunction with him. It might be delegatedto either branch of the legislature, exclusive of, or inconjunction with him. Or it might be exclusivelydelegated to the president.^ 779. In the formation of treaties, secrecy and immediatedespatch are generally requisite, and sometimesabsolutely indispensable. Intelligence may oftenbe obtained, and measures matured in secrecy, whichcould never be done, unless in the faith and confidenceof profound secrecy. No man at all acquainted withdiplomacy, but must have felt, that the success of negotiationsas often depends upon their being unknownby the public, as upon their justice or their policy.Men will assume responsibility in private, and communicateinformation, and express opinions, whichthey would feel the greatest repugnance publicly toavow ; and measures may be defeated by the intriguesand management of foreign powers, if they suspectthem to be in progress, and understand their precisenature and extent. In this view the executive departmentis a far better depositary of the power, thancongress would be. The delays incident to a largeCH. XXXVII.] EXECUTIVE — POWERS. 656assembly ; the differences of opinion ; the time consumedin debate ; and the utter impossibility of secrecy,all combine to render them unfitted for the purposesof diplomacy. And our own experience during theconfederation abundantly demonstrated all the evils,which the theory would lead us to expect. Besides ;there are tides in national affairs, as well as in theaffairs of private life. To discern and profit by themisthe part of true political wisdom ; and the loss of aweek, or even of a day, may sometimes change thewhole aspect of affairs, and render negotiations whollynugatory, or indecisive. The loss of a battle, thedeath of a prince, the removal of a minister, the pressureor removal of fiscal embarrassments at the moment,and other circumstances, may change the whole postureof affairs, and ensure success, or defeat the bestconcerted project. The executive, having a constanteye upon foreign affairs, can promptly meet, and evenanticipate such emergencies, and avail himself of allthe advantages accruing from them ; while a largeassembly would be coldly deliberating on the chancesof success, and the policy of opening negotiations.It is manifest, then, that congress would not be a suitabledepositary of the power.§ 780. The same difficulties would occur from confidingit exclusively to either branch of congress. Eachis too numerous for prompt and immediate action, andsecrecy. The matters in negotiations, which usuallyrequire these qualities in the highest degree, are thepreparatory and auxiliary measures ; and which are tobe seized upon, as it were, in an instant. The presidentcould easily arrange them. But the house, orthe senate, if in session, could not act, until after greatdelays ; and in the recess could not act at all. Tocs CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.have entrusted the power to either would have beento relinquish the benefits of the constitutional agencyof the president in the conduct of foreign negotiations.It is true, that the branch so entrusted might have theoption to employ the president in that capacity ; butthey would also have the option of refraining from it ;and it cannot be disguised, that pique, or cabal, orpersonal or political hostility, might induce them tokeep their pursuits at a distance from his inspectionand participation. Nor could it be expected, that thepresident, as a mere ministerial agent of such branch,would enjoy the confidence and respect of foreignpowers to the same extent, as he would, as the constitutionalrepresentative of the nation itself; and hisinterposition would of course have less efficacy andweight.§ 781. On the other hand, considering the delicacyand extent of the power, it is too much to expect, thata free people would confide to a single magistrate,however respectable, the sole authority to act conclusively,as well as exclusively, upon the subject oftreaties. In England, the power to make treaties isexclusively vested in the crown. But however properit may be in a monarchy, there is no American statesman,but must feel, that such a prerogative in anAmerican president would be inexpedient and dangerous.It would be inconsistent with that wholesomejealousy, which all republics ought to cherish of alldepositaries of power ; and which, experience teachesus, is the best security against the abuse of it. Thecheck, which acts upon the mind from the consideration,that what is done is but preliminary, and requiresthe assent of other independent minds to give it alegal conclusiveness, is a restraint, which awakenscaution, and compels to deliberation.CH. XXXVII.] EXECUTIVE POWERS. 557^ 782. The plan of the constitution is happily adaptedto attain all just objects in relation to foreign negotiations.While it confides the power to the executivedepartment, it guards it from serious abuse by placingit under the ultimate superintendence of a select bodyof high character and high responsibility. It is indeedclear to a demonstration, that this joint possession ofthe power affords a greater security for its just exercise,than the separate possession of it by either. Thepresident is the immediate author and finisher of alltreaties ; and all the advantages, which can be derivedfrom talents, information, integrity, and deliberate investigationon the one hand, and from secrecy anddespatch on the other, are thus combined in the system.But no treaty, so formed, becomes binding uponthe country, unless it receives the deliberate assent oftwo thirds of the senate. In that body all the statesare equally represented ; and, from the nature of theappointment and duration of the office, it may fairly bepresumed at all times to contain a very large portion oftalents, experience, political wisdom, and sincere patriotism,a spirit of liberality, and a deep devotion to allthe substantial interests of the country. The constitutionalcheck of requiring two thirds to confirm a treatyis, of itself, a sufficient guaranty against any wantonsacrifice of private rights, or any betrayal of publicprivileges. To suppose otherwise would be to suppose,that a representative republican government wasa mere phantom ; that the state legislatures were incapable,or unwilling to choose senators possessing duequalifications ; and that the people would voluntarilyconfide power to those, who were ready to promotetheir ruin, and endanger, or destroy their liberties.Without supposing a case of utter indifference, or utterCONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.corruption in the people, it would be impossible, thatthe senate should be so constituted at any time, as thatthe honour and interests of the country would not besafe in their hands. When such an indifference, orcorruption shall have arrived, it will be in vain to prescribeany remedy ; for the constitution will havecrumbled into ruins, or have become a mere shadow,about which it would be absurd to disquiet ourselves.^ 783. Some doubts appear to have been entertainedin the early stages of the government, as to thecorrect exposition of the constitution in regard to theagency of the senate in the formation of treaties. Thequestion was, whether the agency of the senate wasadmissible previous to the negotiation, so as to adviseon the instructions to be given to the ministers ; orw as limited to the exercise of the power of advice andconsent, after the treaty was formed ; or whether thepresident possessed an option to adopt one mode, orthe other, as his judgment might direct. The practicalexposition assumed on the first occasion, whichseems to have occurred in President Washington's administration,was, that the option belonged to the executiveto adopt either mode, and the senate mightadvise before, as well as after, the formation of atreaty. Since that period, the senate have beenrarely, if ever, consulted, until after a treaty has beencompleted, and laid before them for ratification. Whenso laid before the senate, that body is in the habit ofdeliberating upon it, as, indeed, it does on all executivebusiness, in secret, and with closed doors. The senatemay wholly reject the treaty, or advise and consent toa ratification of part of the articles, rejecting others,or recommend additional or explanatory articles. Inthe event of a partial ratification, the treaty does notCH. XXXVII.] EXECUTIVE APPOINTMENTS. 559become the law of the land, until the president andthe foreign sovereign have each assented to the modificationsproposed by the senate. But, although thepresident may ask the advice and consent of the senateto a treaty, he is not absolutely bound by it ; for hemay, after it is given, still constitutionally refuse toratify it. Such an occurrence will probably be rare,because the president will scarcely incline to lay atreaty before the senate, which he is not disposed toratify.^ 784. The next part of the clause respects appointmentsto office. The president is to nominate, andby and with the advice and consent of the senate, toappoint ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls,judges of the Supreme Court, and other officers,whose appointments are not otherwise provided for.^ 785. Under the confederation, an exclusive powerwas given to congress of " sending and receivingambassadors." The term " ambassador," strictly construed,(as would seem to be required by the secondarticle of that instrument,) comprehends the highestgrade only of public ministers ; and excludes thosegrades, which the United States would be most likelyto prefer, whenever foreign embassies may be necessary.But under no latitude of construction could theterm, '' ambassadors," comprehend consuls. Yet itwas found necessary by congress to employ the inferiorgrades of ministers, and to send and receive consuls.It is true, that the mutual appointment of consulsmight have been provided for by treaty ; andwhere no treaty existed, congress might perhaps havehad the authority under the ninth article of the confederation,which conferred a general authority to appointofficers, for managing the general affairs of the United560 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.States. But the admission of foreign consuls into theUnited States, when not stipulated for by treaty, wasno where provided for. The whole subject was fullof embarrassment and constitutional doubts ; and theprovision in the constitution, extending the appointmentto other public ministers and consuls, as well asto ambassadors, is a decided improvement upon theconfederation.§ 786. The mode of appointment to office, pointedout by the constitution, seems entitled to peculiar commendation.There are several ways, in which in ordinarycases the power may be vested. It may be confidedto congress ; or to one branch of the legislature ;or to the executive alone ; or to the executive in concurrencewith any selected branch. The exercise ofit by the people at large will readily be admitted byall considerate statesmen to be impracticable, andtherefore need not be examined. The suggestions,already made upon the treaty-making power, and theinconveniences of vesting it in congress, apply withgreat force to that of vesting the power of appointmentto office in the same body. It would enablecandidates for office to introduce all sorts of cabals,intrigues, and coalitions into congress ; and not onlydistract their attention from their proper legislativeduties ; but probably in a very high degree influenceall legislative measures. A new source of divisionand corruption would thus be infused into the publiccouncils, stimulated by private interests, and pressedby personal solicitations. What would be to be done,in case the senate and house should disagree in an appointment? Are they to vote in convention, or asdistinct bodies ? There would be practical difficultiesattending both courses ; and experience has not .XXXVII.] EXECUTIVE APPOINTMENTS. 561ratified the belief, that either would conduce to goodappointments, or to due responsibility.^ 787. The same reasoning would apply to vestingthe power exclusively in either branch of the legislature.It would make the patronage of the governmentsubservient to private interests, and bring into suspicionthe motives and conduct of members of the appointingbody. There would be great danger, that the electionsat the polls might be materially influenced by thispower, to confer, or to withhold favours of this sort.^ 788. Those, who are accustomed lo profound reflectionupon the human character and human experience,will readily adopt the opinion, that one man ofdiscernment is better fitted to analyze and estimatethe peculiar qualities, adapted to particular offices,than any body of men of equal, or even of superiordiscernment. His sole and undivided responsibilitywill naturally beget a livelier sense of duty, and amore exact regard to reputation. He will inquirewith more earnestness, and decide with more impartiality.He will have fewer personal attachments togratify, than a body of men ; and will be less liableto be misled by his private friendships and affections ;or, at all events, his conduct will be more open toscrutiny, and less liable to be misunderstood. If heventures upon a system of favoritism, he will notescape censure, and can scarcely avoid public detectionand disgrace. But in a public body appointmentswill be materially influenced by party attachments anddislikes ; by private animosities, and antipathies, andpartialities ; and will be generally founded in compromises,having little to do with the merit of candidates,and much to do with the selfish interests of individualsand cabals. They will be too much governed by local,Abr. 71562 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.or sectional, or party arrangements. A president,chosen from the nation at large, may well be presumedto possess high intelligence, integrity, and sense ofcharacter. He will be compelled to consult publicopinion in the most important appointments ; andmust be interested to vindicate the propriety of hisappointments by selections from those, whose qualificationsare unquestioned, and unquestionable. If heshould act otherwise, and surrender the public patronageinto the hands of profligate men, or low adventurers,it will be impossible for him long to retainpublic favour. Nothing, no, not even the whole influenceof party, could long screen him from the justindignation of the people. Though slow, the ultimateaward of popular opinion would stamp upon his conductits merited infamy. No president, howeverweak, or credulous, (if such a person could ever underany conjuncture of circumstances obtain the office,)would fail to perceive, or to act upon admonitions ofthis sort. At all events, he would be less likely todisregard them, than a large body of men, who wouldshare the responsibility, and encourage each other inthe division of the patronage of the government.^ 789. But, though these general considerationsmight easily reconcile us to the choice of vesting thepower of appointment exclusively in the president, inpreference to the senate, or house of representativesalone ; yet the patronage of the government, and theappointments to office are too important to the publicwelfare, not to induce great hesitation in vesting themexclusively in the president. The power may beabused ; and, assuredly, it will be abused, except inthe hands of an executive of great firmness, independence,integrity, and public spirit. It should neverCH. XXXVII.] EXECUTIVE APPOINTMENTS. 563be forgotten, that in a republican government officesare established, and are to be filled, not to gratifyprivate interests and private attachments ; not as ameans of corrupt influence, or individual profit ; notfor cringing favourites, or court sycophants ; but forpurposes of the highest public good ; to give dignity,strength, purity, and energy to the administration ofthe laves. It would not, therefore, be a wise courseto omit any precaution, which, at the same time, thatit should give to the president a power over the appointmentsof those, who are in conjunction with himselfto execute the laws, should also interpose a salutarycheck upon its abuse, acting by way of preventive,as well as of remedy.^ 790. Happily, this difficult task has been achievedby the constitution. The president is to nominate,and thereby has the sole power to select for office ;but his nomination cannot confer office, unless approvedby a majority of the senate. His responsibilityand theirs is thus complete, and distinct. He cannever be compelled to yield to their appointment ofa man unfit for office ; and, on the other hand, theymay withhold their advice and consent from any candidate,who in their judgment does not possess duequalifications for office. Thus, no serious abuse ofthe power can take place without the co-operation oftwo co-ordinate branches, of the government, actingin distinct spheres ; and, if there should be any improperconcession on either side, it is obvious, thatfrom the structure and changes, incident to each department,the evil cannot long endure, and will beremedied, as it should be, by the elective franchise.The consciousness of this check will make the presidentmore circumspect, and deliberate in his nominatedCONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.tions for office. He will feel, that, in case of a disagreementof opinion with the senate, his principalvindication must depend upon the unexceptionablecharacter of his nomination. And in case of a rejection,the most, that can be said, is, that he had nothis first choice. He will still have au wide range ofselection ; and his responsibility to present anothercandidate, entirely qualified for the office, will be completeand unquestionable.^791. Nor is it to be expected, that the senate willordinarily fail of ratifying the appointment of a suitableperson for the office. Independent of the desire,w which such a body may naturally be presumed to feel,of having offices suitably filled, (when they cannotmake the appointment themselves,) there will be aresponsibility to public opinion for a rejection, whichwill overcome all common private wishes. Cases,indeed, may be imagined, in which the senate fromparty motives, from a spirit of opposition, and evenfrom motives of a more private nature, may reject anomination absolutely unexceptionable. But suchoccurrences w^U be rare. The more common error,(if there shall be any) will be too great a facility toyield to the executive wishes, as a means of personal,or popular favour. A president will rarely wantmeans, if he shall choose to use them, to induce somemembers of such a body to aid his nominations ; sincea correspondent influence may be fairly presumed toexist, to gratify such persons in other recommendationsfor office, and thus to make them indirectly the dispensersof local patronage. It will be, principally,with regard to high officers, such as ambassadors,judges, heads of departments, and other appointmentsof great public importance, that the senate will interCH. XXXVII.] EXECUTIVE APPOINTMENTS. 565pose to prevent an unsuitable choice. Their owndignity, and sense of character, their duty to theircountry, and their very title to office, will be materiallydependent upon a firm discharge of their duty on suchoccasions.^ 792. Perhaps the duties of the president, in thedischarge of this most delicate and important duty ofhis office, were never better summed up, than in thefollowing language of a distinguished commentator.*' A proper selection or appointment of subordinateofficers is one of the strongest marks of a powerfulmind. It is a duty of the president to acquire, as faras possible, an intimate knowledge of the capacitiesand characters of his fellow citizens ; to disregard theimportunities of friends ; the hints or menaces of enemies; the bias of party ; and the hope of popularity.The latter is sometimes the refuge of feeble-mindedmen ; but its gleam is transient, if it is obtained by adereliction of honest duty and sound discretion. Popularfavour is best secured by carefully ascertaining, andstrictly pursuing the true interests of the people. Thepresident himself is elected on the supposition, that heis the most capable citizen to understand, and promotethose interests ; and in every appointment he ought toconsider himself as executing a public trust of thesame nature. Neither should the fear of giving offenceto the public, or pain to the individual, deter him fromthe immediate exercise of his power of removal, onproof of incapacity, or infidelity in the subordinateofficer. The public, uninformed of the necessity, maybesurprised, and at first dissatisfied ; but public approbationultimately accompanies the fearless and uprightdischarge of duty."^ 793. The other part of the clause, while it leavesCONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.to the president the appointment to all offices, nototherwise provided for, enables congress to vest theappointment of such inferior officers, as they may thinkproper, in the president, in the courts of law, or in theheads of departments. The propriety of this discretionarypower in congress, to some extent, cannot wellbe questioned. If any discretion should be allowed,its limits could hardly admit of being exactly defined ;and it might fairly be left to congress to act accordingto the lights of experience. It is difficult to foresee,or to provide for all the combinations of circumstances,which might vary the right to appoint in such cases.In one age the appointment might be most proper inthe president ; and in another age, in a department.^794. In the practical course of the government,there does not seem to have been any exact line drawn,who are, and who are not, to be deemed inferior officersin the sense of the constitution, whose appointmentdoes not necessarily require the concurrence ofthe senate. In many cases of appointments, congresshave required the concurrence of the senate, where,perhaps, it might not be easy to say, that it was requiredby the constitution. The power of congresshas been exerted to a great extent, under this clause,in favour of the executive department. The presidentis by law invested, either solely, or with the senate,with the appointment of all military and naval officers,and of the most important civil officers, and especiallyof those connected with the administration of justice,the collection of the revenue, and the supplies and expendituresof the nation. The courts of the Unionpossess the narrow prerogative of appointing their ownclerk, and reporter, without any farther patronage. Theheads of department are, in like manner, generally .XXXVII.] EXECUTIVE APPOINTMENTS. 567titled to the appointment of the clerks in their respectiveoffices. But the great anomaly in the system isthe enormous patronage of the postmaster general, whois invested with the sole and exclusive authority toappoint, and remove all deputy post-masters ; andwhose power and influence have thus, by slow degrees,accumulated, until it is, perhaps, not too much to say,that it rivals, if it does not exceed, in value and extent,that of the president himself. How long a power sovast, and so accumulating, shall remain without anycheck on the part of any other branch of the government,is a question for statesmen, and not for jurists.But it cannot be disguised, that it will be idle to imposeconstitutional restraints upon high executive appointments,if this power, which pervades every village ofthe republic, and exerts an irresistible, though silent,influence in the direct shape of office, or in the no lessinviting form of lucrative contracts, is suffered to remainwithout scrutiny or rebuke. It furnishes no argumentagainst the interposition of a check, which shall requirethe advice and consent of the senate to appointments,that the power has not hitherto been abused.In its own nature, the post-office establishment is susceptibleof abuse to such an alarming degree ; thewhole correspondence of the country is so completelysubmitted to the fidelity and integrity of the agents,who conduct it ; and the means of making it subservientto mere state policy are so abundant, that the onlysurprise is, that it has not already awakened the publicjealousy, and been placed under more effectual control.It may be said, without the slightest disparagement ofany officer, who has presided over it, that if ever thepeople are to be corrupted, or their liberties are to beprostrated, this establishment will furnish the most faceCONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.cite means, and be the easiest employed to accomplishsuch a purpose.^ 795. It is observable, that the constitution makesno mention of any power of removal by the executiveof any officers whatever. As, however, the tenure ofoffice of no officers, except those in the judicial department,is, by the constitution, provided to be duringgood behaviour, it follows by irresistible inference,that all others must hold their offices during pleasure,unless congress shall have given some other duration totheir office. As far as congress constitutionally possessthe power to regulate, and delegate the appointmentof *' inferior officers," so far they may prescribe theterm of office, the manner in which, and the persons bywhom, the removal, as well as the appointment to office,shall be made. But two questions naturally occurupon this subject. The first is, to whom, in the absenceof all such legislation, does the power of removalbelong? to the appointing power, or to the executive? to the president and senate, who have concurredin the appointment, or to the president alone?The next is, if the power of removal belongs to theexecutive, in regard to any appointments confided bythe constitution to him ; whether congress can giveany duration of office in such cases, not subject to theexercise of this power of removal ? Hitherto the latterhas remained a merely speculative question, as all ourlegislation, giving a limited duration to office, recognisesthe executive power of removal, as in full force.^ 796. The other is a vastly important practicalquestion ; and, in an early stage of the government,underwent a most elaborate discussion. The languageof the constitution is, that the president "shall nominate,and, by and with the advice and consent of theCH. Xxxvi.] EXECUTIVE REMOVALS. 569senate, appoint, " &c. The power to nominate doesnot naturally, or necessarily include the power to remove; and if the power to appoint does include it, thenthe latter belongs conjointly to the executive and thesenate. In short, under such circumstances, the removaltakes place in virtue of the new appointment, bymere operation of law. It results, and is not separablefrom the appointment itself.§ 797. This was the doctrine maintained with greatearnestness by the Federalist; and it had a mostmaterial tendency to quiet the just alarms of theoverwhelming influence, and arbitrary exercise of thisprerogative of the executive, which might prove fatalto the personal independence, and freedom of opinionof public officers, as well as to the public liberties ofthe country. Indeed, it is utterly impossible not tofeel, that, if this unlimited power of removal does exist,it may be made, in the hands of a bold and designingman, of high ambition, and feeble principles, an instrumentof the worst oppression, and most vindictivevengeance. Even in monarchies, while the councilsof state are subject to perpetual fluctuations and changes,the ordinary officers of the government are permittedto remain in the silent possession of theiroffices, undisturbed by the policy, or the passions ofthe favourites of the court. But in a republic, wherefreedom of opinion and action are guaranteed by thevery first principles of the government, if a successfulparty may first elevate their candidate to office, and thenmake him the instrument of their resentments, or theirmercenary bargains ; if men may be made spies uponthe actions of their neighbours, to displace them fromoffice ; or if fawning sycophants upon the popular leaderof the day may gain his patronage, to the exclusionAbr. 72570 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK 111.worthier and abler men, it is most manifest, thatelections will be corrupted at the very source ; andthose, who seek office, will have every motive to delude,and deceive the people. It was not, therefore,without reason, that, in the animated discussion alreadyalluded to, it was urged, that the power of removalwas incident to the power of appointment. That itwould be a most unjustifiable construction of the constitution,and of its implied powers, to hold otherwise.That such a prerogative in the executive was in itsown nature monarchical and arbitrary ; and eminentlydangerous to the best interests, as well as to the liberties,of the country. It would convert all the officersof the country into the mere tools and creatures of thepresident. A dependence so servile, on one individual,would deter men of high and honorable mindsfrom engaging in the public service. And if, contraryto expectation, such men should be brought intooffice, they would be reduced to the necessity of sacrificingevery principle of independence to the will ofthe chief magistrate, or of exposing themselves to thedisgrace of being removed from office, and that too ata time, when it might no longer be in their power toengage in other pursuits.^ 798. On the other hand, those, who after theadoption of the constitution held the doctrine, (for beforethat period it never appears to have been avowedby any of its friends, although it was urged by its opponents,as a reason for rejecting it,) that the powerof removal belonged to the president, argued, that itresulted from the nature of the power, and the convenience,and even necessity of its exercise. It wasclearly in its nature a part of the executive power, andwas indispensable for a due execution of the laws, andCH. XXXVII.] EXECUTIVE REMOVALS. 571a regular administration of the public affairs. Whatwould become of the public interests, if during therecess of the senate the president could not remove anunfaithful public officer ? If he could not displace acorrupt ambassador, or head of department, or otherofficer engaged in the finances, or expendituresof the government ? If the executive, to prevent anon-execution of the laws, or a non-performance ofhis own proper functions, had a right to suspend anunworthy officer from office, this power was in no respectdistinguishable from a power of removal. Infact, it is an exercise, though in a more moderatedform, of the same power. Besides ; it was argued,that the danger, that a president would remove goodmenfrom office was wholly imaginary. It was notby the splendour attached to the character of a particularpresident, like Washington, that such an opinionwas to be maintained. It was founded on the structureof the office. The man, in whose favour a majorityof the people of the United States would unite, toelect him to such an office, had every probability at leastin favour of his principles. He must be presumed topossess integrity, independence, and high talents. Itwould be impossible, that he should abuse the patronageof the government, or his power of removal, to thebase purposes of gratifying a party, or of ministering tohis own resentments, or of displacing upright and excellentofficers for a mere difference of opinion. Thepublic odium, which would inevitably attach to suchconduct, would be a perfect security against it. And,in truth, removals made from such motives, or with aview to bestow the offices upon dependents, or favourites,would be an impeachable offence.^ 799. That the final decision of this question in572 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.favour of the executive power of removal, was greatlyinfluenced by the exalted character of the president,then in office, vv^as asserted at the time, and hasalways been believed. Yet the doctrine was opposed,as well as supported, by the highest talents andpatriotism of the country. The public, however, acquiescedin this decision ; and it constitutes, perhaps,the most extraordinary case in the history of the governmentof a power, conferred by implication on theexecutive, by the assent of a bare majority of congress,which has not been questioned on many other occasions.Even the most jealous advocates of state rights seemto have slumbered over this vast reach of authority ;and have left it untouched, as the neutral ground ofcontroversy, in which they desired to reap no harvest,and from which they retired without leaving any protestationsof title or contest.§ 800. Whether the predictions of the original advocatesof the executive power, or those of the opposersof it, are likely, in the future progress of the government,to be realized, must be left to the sober judgmentof the community, and to the impartial award oftime. If there has been any aberration from the trueconstitutional exposition of the power of removal,which the reader must decide for himself, it will bedifficult, and perhaps impracticable, after forty years'experience, to recall the practice to the correct theory.But at all events, it will be a consolation to those, wholove the Union, and honour a devotion to the patrioticdischarge of duty, that in regard to " inferior officers,"which appellation probably includes ninety-nine out ofa hundred of the lucrative offices in the government,the remedy for any permanent abuse is still within thepower of congress, by the simple expedient of required.XXXVII.] EXECUTIVE APPOINTMENTS. 573iris the consent of the senate to removals in suchcases.^ 801. Another point of great practical importanceis, w^hen the. appointment of any officer is to be deemedcomplete. It vv^ill be seen in a succeeding clause,that the president is to " commission all the officers of"the United States." In regard to officers, who areremovable at the will of the executive, the point is unimportant,since they may be displaced, and their commissionarrested at any moment. But if the officer isnot so removable, the time, when the appointment iscomplete, becomes of very deep interest.§ 802. This subject was very elaborately discussedin the celebrated case of Carbury v. Madison, Uponthe fullest deliberation, the court were of opinion,that, when a commission has been signed by the president,the appointment is final and complete. Theofficer appointed has then conferred on him legal rights,which cannot be resumed. Until that period, the discretionof the president may be exercised by him, asto the appointment; but, from that moment, it is irrevocable.His power over the office is then terminatedin all cases, where by law the officer is not removableby him. The right to the office is then in the personappointed, and he has the absolute, unconditionalpower of accepting, or rejecting it. Neither a deliveryof the commission, nor an actual acceptance of theoffice, is indispensable to make the appointment perfect.^ 803. The next clause of the constitution is, " Thepresident shall have power to fill up all vacancies, thatmay happen during the recess of the senate, by grantingcommissions, which shall expire at the end oftheir next session."^ 804. The propriety of this grant is so obvious.574 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.that it can require no elucidation. There was but oneof two courses to be adopted ; either, that the senateshould be perpetually in session, in order to providefor the appointment of officers ; or, that the presidentshould be authorized to make temporary appointmentsduring the recess, which should expire, when the senateshould have had an opportunity to act on the subject.The former course would have been at once burthensometo the senate, and expensive to the public. Thelatter combines convenience, promptitude of action,and general security.§ 805. The appointments so made, by the very languageof the constitution, expire at the next session ofthe senate; and the commissions given by the Presidenthave the same duration. When the senate is assembled,if the president nominates the same officer to the office,this is to all intents and purposes a new nomination tooffice ; and, if approved by the senate, the appointmentis a new appointment, and not a mere continuationof the old appointment. So that, if a bond forfidelity in office has been given under the first appointmentand commission, it does not apply to any actsdone under the new appointment and commission.§ 806. The next section of the second article is,He (the president) shall from time to time give tothe congress information of the state of the Union,and recommend to their consideration such measures,*' as he shall judge necessary and expedient. He may,on extraordinary occasions, convene both houses, oreither of them, and, in case of a disagreement beetween them, with respect to the time of adjournment, he may adjourn them to such time, as he shall"think proper. He shall receive ambassadors, andother public ministers. He shall take care, that theCH. XXXVII.] EXECUTIVE — DUTIES. 575laws be faithfully executed ; and shall commissionall the officers of the United States."^ 807. The first part, relative to the president'sgiving information and recommending measures tocongress, is so consonant with the structure of theexecutive department of the colonial and state governments,with the usages and practice of other freegovernments, with the general convenience of congress,and with a due share of responsibility on the part ofthe executive, that it may well be presumed to beabove all real objection. From the nature and dutiesof the executive department, he must possess moreextensive sources of information, as well in regard todomestic as foreign affairs, than can belong to congress.The true workings of the laws ; the defects in thenature or arrangements of the general systems of trade,finance, and justice ; and the military, naval, and civilestablishments of the Union, are more readily seen,and more constantly under the view of the executive,than they can possibly be of any other department.There is great wisdom, therefore, in not merely allowing,but in requiring, the president to lay before congressall facts and information, which may assist theirdeliberations ; and in enabling him at once to pointout the evil, and to suggest the remedy. He is thusJustly made responsible, not merely for a due administrationof the existing systems, but for due diligenceand examination into the means of improving them.§ 808. The power to convene congress on extraordinaryoccasions is indispensable to the proper operations,and even safety of the government. Occasionsmay occur in the recess of congress, requiring thegovernment to take vigorous measures to repel foreignaggression, depredations, and direct hostilities ; to676 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.provide adequate means to mitigate, or overcome unexpectedcalamities ; to suppress insurrections ; andto provide for innumerable other important exigencies,arising out of the intercourse and revolutions amongnations.§ 809. The power to adjourn congress in cases ofdisagreement is equally indispensable ; since it is theonly peaceable way of terminating a controversy,which can lead to nothing but distraction in the publiccouncils.^ 810. On the other hand, the duty imposed uponhim to take care, that the laws be faithfully executed,follows out the strong injunctions of his oath of office,that he will " preserve protect, and defend the constitution."The great object of the executive departmentis to accomplish this purpose ; and without it, be theform of government whatever it may, it will be utterlyworthless for offence, or defence ; for the redress ofgrievances, or the protection of rights ; for the happiness,or good order, or safety of the people.^811. The next power is to receive ambassadors andother public ministers. This subject has been alreadyincidentally touched. A similar power existed underthe confederation ; but it was confined to receivingambassadors," which word, in a strict sense, (as hasbeen already stated,) comprehends the highest gradeonly of ministers, and not those of an inferior character.The policy of the United States would ordinarily preferthe employment of the inferior grades ; and thereforethe description is properly enlarged, so as to includeall classes of ministers. Why the receiving ofconsuls was not also expressly mentioned, as the appointmentof them is in the preceding clause, is noteasily to be accounted for, especially as the defect ofCH. XXXVII.] EXECUTIVE — POWERS. 577the confederation on this head was fully understoodThe power, however, may be fairly inferred from otherparts of the constitution ; and indeed seems a generalincident to the executive authority. It has constantlybeen exercised without objection ; and foreign consulshave never been allowed to discharge any functions ofoffice, until they have received the exequatur of thepresident. Consuls, indeed, are not diplomatic functionaries,or political representatives of a foreign nation ;but are treated in the character of mere commercialagents.^812. The power to receive ambassadors and ministersis always an important, and sometimes a verydelicate function ; since it constitutes the only accreditedmedium, through which negotiations and friendlyrelations are ordinarily carried on with foreign powers.A government may in its discretion lawfully refuse toreceive-an ambassador, or other minister, without itsaffording any just cause of war. But it would generallybe deemed an unfriendly act, and might provokehostilities, unless accompanied by conciliatory explanations.A refusal is sometimes made upon the groundof the bad character of the minister, or his former offensiveconduct, or of the special subject of the embassynot being proper, or convenient for discussion.This, however, is rarely done. But a much moredelicate occasion is, when a civil war breaks out in anation, and two nations are formed, or two parties inthe same nation, each claiming the sovereignty of thewhole, and the contest remains as yet undecided,flagrante hello. In such a case a neutral nation mayvery properly withhold its recognition of the supremacyof either party, or of the existence of two independentnations ; and on that account refuse to receive an .73578 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.ambassador from either. It is obvious, that in such casesthe simple acknowledgment of the minister of eitherparty, or nation, might be deemed taking part againstthe other ; and thus as affording a strong countenance,or opposition, to rebellion and civil dismemberment.On this account, nations, placed in such a predicament,have not hesitated sometimes to declare war againstneutrals, as interposing in the war ; and have madethem the victims of their vengeance, when they havebeen anxious to assume a neutral position. The exerciseof this prerogative of acknowledging new nations,or ministers, is, therefore, under such circumstances,an executive function of great delicacy, whichrequires the utmost caution and deliberation. If theexecutive receives an ambassador, or other minister,as the representative of a new nation, or of a party inacivil war in an old nation, it is an acknowledgmentof the sovereign authority de facto of such new nation,or party. If such recognition is made, it is conclusiveupon the nation, unless, indeed, it can be reversed byan act of congress repudiating it. If, on the otherhand, such recognition has been refused by the executive,it is said, that congress may, notwithstanding,solemnly acknowledge the sovereignty of the nation,or party. These, however, are propositions, whichhave hitherto remained, as abstract statements underthe constitution ; and, therefore, can be propounded,not as absolutely true, but as still open to discussion,if they should ever arise in the course of our foreigndiplomacy. The constitution has expressly investedthe executive with power to receive ambassadors, andother ministers. It has not expressly invested congresswith the power, either to repudiate, or acknowledgethem. At all events, in the case of a revolution,CH. XXXVII.] EXECUTIVE. INCIDENTAL POWERS. 579or dismemberment of a nation, the judiciary cannottake notice of any new government, or sovereignty,until it has been duly recognised by some other departmentof the government, to whom the power isconstitutionally confided.^813. As incidents to the power to receive ambassadorsand foreign ministers, the president is understoodto possess the power to refuse them, and todismiss those, who, having been received, become obnoxiousto censure, or unfit to be allowed the privilege,by their improper conduct, or by political events.While, however, they are permitted to remain, aspublic functionaries, they are entitled to all the immunitiesand rights, which the law of nations has providedat once for their dignity, their independence,and their inviolability.^814. There are other incidental powers, belongingto the executive department, which are necessarilyimplied from the nature of the functions, which areconfided to it. Among these must necessarily be includedthe power to perform them, without any obstructionor impediment whatsoever. The presidentcannot, therefore, be liable to arrest, imprisonment, ordetention, while he is in the discharge of the duties ofhis office ; and for this purpose his person must bedeemed, in civil cases at least, to possess an officialinviolability. In the exercise of his political powershe is to use his own discretion, and is accountableonly to his country, and to his own conscience. Hisdecision, in relation to these powers, is subject to nocontrol ; and his discretion, when exercised, is conclusive.But he has no authority to control otherofficers of the government, in relation to the dutiesimposed upon them by law, in cases not touching hispolitical powers.680 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.§ 815. We have seen, that by law the presidentpossesses the right to require the written advice andopinions of his cabinet ministers, upon all questionsconnected with their respective departments. But,he does not possess a like authority, in regard to thejudicial department. That branch of the governmentcan be called upon only to decide controversies,brought before them in a legal form ; and thereforeis bound to abstain from any extra-judicial opinionsupon points of law, even though solemnly requestedby the executive.^ 816. The remaining section of the fourth article,declaring that the President, Vice-president, and allcivil officers of the United States shall be liable toimpeachment, has been already fully considered in anotherplace. And thus is closed the examination ofthe rights, powers, and duties of the executive department.Unless my judgment has been unduly biassed,I think it will be found impossible to hold from thispart of the constitution a tribute of profound respect,if not of the liveliest admiration. All, that seemsdesirable, in order to gratify the hopes, secure thereverence, and sustain the dignity of the nation, is,that the office should always be occupied by a man ofelevated talents, of ripe virtues, of incorruptible integrity,and of tried*patriotism ; one, who shall forgethis own interests, and remember, that he representsnot a party, but the whole nation ; one, whose famemay be rested with posterity, not upon the false eulogiesof favourites, but upon the solid merit of havingpreserved the glory, and enhanced the prosperity ofthe country.CH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY IMPORTANCE OF. 581CHAPTER XXXVIII.JUDICIARY ORGANIZATION AND POWERS.§ 817. The order of the subject next conducts usto the consideration of the third article of the constitution,which embraces the organization and powers ofthe judicial department.<^ 818. The importance of the establishment of ajudicial department in the national government hasbeen already incidentally discussed under other heads.The want of it constituted one of the vital defects ofthe confederation. And every government must, in itsessence, be unsafe and unfit for a free people, wheresuch a department does not exist, with powers co-extensivewith those of the legislative department. Wherethere is no judicial department to interpret, pronounce,and execute the law, to decide controversies, and toenforce rights, the government must either perish by itsown imbecility, or the other departments of governmentmust usurp powers, for the purpose of commandingobedience, to the destruction of liberty. The willof those, who govern, will, under such circumstances,become absolute and despotic ; and it is wholly immaterial,whether power is vested in a single tyrant, or in anassembly of tyrants. No remark is better founded inhumanexperience, than that of Montesquieu, that "thereis no liberty, if the judiciary power be not separated fromthe legislative and executive powers." And it is noless true, that personal security and private propertyrest entirely upon the wisdom, the stability, and theintegrity of the courts of justice. If that government582 CONSTITUTION OF THE C7. STATES. [bOOK III.can be truly said to be despotic and intolerable, inwhich the law is vague and uncertain, it cannot but berendered stilly more oppressive and more mischievous,when the actual administration of justice is dependentupon caprice, or favour, upon the will of rulers, or theinfluence of popularity. When power becomes right,it is of little consequence, whether decisions rest uponcorruption, or weakness, upon the accidents of chance,or upon deliberate wrong. In every well organizedgovernment, therefore, with reference to the securityboth of public rights and private rights, it is indispensable,that there should be a judicial department toascertain, and decide rights, to punish crimes, to administerjustice, and to protect the innocent from injuryand usurpation.^ 819. In the national government the power isequally as important, as in the state governments. Thelaws and treaties, and even the constitution, of theUnited States, would become a dead letter without it.Indeed, in a complicated government, like ours, wherethere is an assemblage of republics, combined under acommon head, the necessity of some controlling judicialpower, to ascertain and enforce the powers of theUnion, is, if possible, still more striking. The laws ofthe whole would otherwise be in continual danger ofbeing contravened by the laws of the parts. The nationalgovernment would be reduced to a servile dependenceupon the states; and the same scenes wouldbe again acted over in solemn mockery, which beganin the neglect, and ended in the ruin, of the confederation.Power, without adequate means to enforce it, islike a body in a state of suspended animation. For allpractical purposes it is, as if its faculties were extinguished.Even if there were no danger of collision beck.XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY — IMPORTANCE OF. 683tween the laws and powers of the Union, and those ofthe states, it is utterly impossible, without some superintendingjudiciary establishment, that there should be anyuniform administration, or interpretation of them. Theidea of uniformity of decision by thirteen independentand co-ordinate tribunals (and the number is now advancedto twenty-four) is absolutely visionary, if notabsurd. The consequence would necessarily be, thatneither the constitution, nor the laws, neither the rightsand powers of the Union, nor those of the states, wouldbe the same in any two states. And there would beperpetual fluctuations and changes, growing out of thediversities of judgment, as well as of local institutions,interests, and habits of thought.§ 820. Two ends, then, of paramount importance,and fundamental to a free government, are proposed tobe attained by the establishment of a national judiciary.The first is a due execution of the powers of the government; and the second is a uniformity in the interpretationand operation of those powers, and of thelaws enacted in pursuance of them. The power of interpretingthe laws involves necessarily the function toascertain, whether they are conformable to the constitution,or not ; and if not so conformable, to declare themvoid and inoperative. As the constitution is the supremelaw of the land, in a conflict between that andthe laws, either of congress, or of the states, it becomesthe duty of the judiciary to follow that only, which isof paramount obligation. This results from the verytheory of a republican constitution of government ; forotherwise the acts of the legislature and executivewould in effect become supreme and uncontrollable,notwithstanding any prohibitions or limitations containedin the constitution ; and usurpations of the most CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.equivocal and dangerous character might be assumed,without any remedy being within the reach of the citizens.The people would thus be at the mercy of theirrulers, in the state and national governments; and an omnipotencewould practically exist, like that claimed forthe British Parliament. The universal sense of Americahas decided, that in the last resort the judiciary mustdecide upon the constitutionality of the acts and lawsof the general and state governments, a§ far as they arecapable of being made the subject of judicial controversy.It follows, that, when they are subjected to thecognizance of the judiciary, its judgments must be conclusive;for otherwise they may be disregarded, and theacts of the legislature and executive enjoy a secure andirresistible triumph.§ 821. The framers of the constitution, having thesegreat principles in view, adopted two fundamental ruleswith entire unanimity; first, that a national judiciaryought to be established; secondly, that the nationaljudiciary ought to possess powers co-extensive withthose of the legislative department. Indeed, the latternecessarily flowed from the former, and was treated,and must always be treated, as an axiom of politicalgovernment. But these provisions alone would notbe sufficient to ensure a complete administration ofpublic justice, or to give permanency to the republic.The judiciary must be so organized, as to carry intocomplete effect all the purposes of its establishment.It must possess wisdom, learning, integrity, independence,and firmness. It must at once possess thepower and the means to check usurpation, and enforceexecution of its judgments. Mr. Burke has, with singularsagacity and pregnant brevity, stated the doctrine,which every republic should steadily sustain, and conch.XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY ORGANIZATION. 585sententiously inculcate. " Whatever," says he, " is supremein a state ought to have, as much as possible, itsjudicial authority so constituted, as not only not to dependupon it, but in some sort to balance it. It oughtto give security to its justice against its power. Itought to make its judicature, as it videre, somethingexterior to the state." The best manner, in which thisis to be accomplished, must mainly depend upon themode of appointment, the tenure of office, the compensationof the judges, and the jurisdiction confidedto the department in its various branches.§ 822. Let us proceed, then, to the consideration ofthe judicial department, as it is established by theconstitution, and see, how far adequate means are providedfor all these important purposes. *^ 823. The first section of the third article is asfollows: "The judicial power of the United Statesshall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in suchinferior courts, as the congress may from time to timeordain and establish. The judges, both of the supremeand inferior courts, shall hold their offices duringgood behaviour ; and shall at stated times receivefor their services a compensation, which shallnot be diminished during their continuance in office."To this may be added the clause in the enumeration ofthe powers of congress in the first article, (which is butamere repetition,) that congress shall have power " toconstitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court."^ 824. To the established-nt of one court of supremeand final jurisdiction, there do not seem tohave been any strenuous objections generally insistedon in the state conventions, though many were urgedagainst certain portions of the jurisdiction, proposed bythe constitution to be vested in the courts of the UnitedAbr. 74586 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.States. The principal question seems to have been ofa different nature, whether it ought to be a distinct coordinatedepartment, or a branch of the legislature.^ 825. In regard to the power of constituting inferiorcourts of the Union, it is evidently calculated toobviate the necessity of having recourse to the SupremeCourt in every case of federal cognizance. Itenables the national government to institute, or authorizein each state and district of the United States, atribunal competent to the determination of all mattersof national jurisdiction within its limits. One of twocourses only could be open for adoption ; either to createinferior courts under the national authority, to reachall cases fit for the national jurisdiction, which eitherconstitutionally, or conveniently, could not be of originalcognizance in the Supreme Court ; or to confide jurisdictionof the same cases to the state courts, with aright of appeal to the Supreme Court. To the lattercourse solid objections were thought to apply, whichrendered it ineligible and unsatisfactory. In the firstplace, the judges of the state courts would be whollyirresponsible to the national government for their conductin the administration of national justice ; so, thatthe national government would, or might be, whollydependent upon the good will, or sound discretion ofthe states, in regard to the efficiency, promptitude, andability, with which the judicial authority of the nationshould be administered. In the next place, the prevalenceof a local, or sectional spirit might be found to disqualifythe state tribunals for a suitable discharge of nationaljudicial functions ; and the very modes of appointmentof some of the state judges might render them improperchannels of the judicial authority of the Union.State judges, holding their offices during pleasure, orCH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY — ORGANIZATION. 587from year to year, or for other short periods, would, orat least might, be too little independent to be reliedupon for an inflexible execution of the national laws.What could be done, where the state itself shouldhappen to be in hostility to the national government, (asmight well be presumed occasionally to be the case,from local interests, party spirit, or peculiar prejudices,)if the state tribunals were to be the sole depositariesof the judicial powers of the Union, in the ordinaryadministration of criminal, as well as of civil justice 1Besides; if the state tribunals were thus entrustedwith the ordinary administration of the criminal andcivil justice of the Union, there would be a necessityfor leaving the door of appeal as widely open, as possible.In proportion to the grounds of confidence in,or distrust of, the subordinate tribunals, ought to be thefacility or difficulty of appeals. An unrestrained courseof appeals would be a source of much private, as wellas public inconvenience. It would encourage litigation,and lead to the most oppressive expenses. Nor shouldit be omitted, that this very course of appeals wouldnaturally lead to great jealousies, irritations, and collisionsbetween the state courts and the Supreme Court,not only from differences of opinions, but from thatpride of character, and consciousness of independence,which would be felt by state judges, possessing theconfidence of their own state, and irresponsible to theUnion.§ 826. In considering the first clause of the thirdsection, declaring, that " the judicial power of the UnitedStates shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and"in such inferior courts, as the congress may, from timeto time, ordain and establish," we are naturally led tothe inquiry, whether congress possess any discretion.588 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.as to the creation of a Supreme Court and inferiorcourts, in which the constitutional jurisdiction is to bevested. This was at one time matter of much discussion; and is vital to the existence of the judicial department.If congress possess any discretion on thissubject, it is obvious, that the judiciary, as a co-ordinatedepartment of the government, may, at the willof congress, be annihilated, or stripped of all its importantjurisdiction ; for, if the discretion exists, no one cansay in what manner, or at what time, or under whatcircumstances, it may, or ought to be exercised. Thewhole argument, upon which such an interpretation hasbeen attempted to be maintained, is, that the languageof the constitution, " shall be vested," is not imperative,but simply indicates the future tense. This interpretationhas been overruled by the Supreme Court,upon solemn deliberation. "The language of the thirdarticle," say the court, "throughout is manifestly designedto be mandatory upon the legislature. Its obligatoryforce is so imperative, that congress could not,without a violation of its duty, have refused to carry itinto operation. The judicial power of the UnitedStates shall he vested (not may be vested) in one SupremeCourt, and in such inferior courts, as congressmay, from time to time, ordain and establish. Couldcongress have lawfully refused to create a SupremeCourt, or to vest in it the constitutional jurisdiction?'The judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts,shall hold their offices during good behaviour, and shallat stated times, receive, for their services, a compensation,which shall not be diminished during their continuancein office.' Could congress create, or limit anyother tenure of the judicial office ? Could they refuseto pay, at stated times, the stipulated salary, or diningXXXVIII.] JUDICIARY — ORGANIZATION. 589wish it during the continuance in office? But one answercan be given to these questions. It must be in thenegative. The object of the constitution was to establishthree great departments of government ; the legislative,the executive, and the judicial department.The first was to pass laws, the second to approve andexecute them, and the third to expound and enforcethem. Without the latter, it would be impossible tocarry into effect some of the express provisions of theconstitution. How, otherwise, could crimes against theUnited States be tried and punished? How couldcauses between two states be heard and determined 1The judicial power must, therefore, be vested in somecourt by congress ; and to suppose, that it was not anobligation binding on them, but might, at their pleasure,be omitted, or declined, is to suppose, that, under thesanction of the constitution, they might defeat the constitutionitself. A construction, which would lead tosuch a result, cannot be sound."§ 827. The constitution has wisely established,that there shall be one Supreme Court, with a view touniformity of decision in all cases whatsoever, belongingto the judicial department, whether they arise atthe common law, or in equity, or within the admiraltyand prize jurisdiction ; whether they respect the doctrinesof mere municipal law, or constitutional law, orthe law of nations. It is obvious, that, if there were independentsupreme courts of common law, of equity,and of admiralty, a diversity of judgment might, andalmost necessarily would spring up, not only, as to thelimits of the jurisdiction of each tribunal ; but as to thefundamental doctrines of municipal, constitutional, andpublic law. The effect of this diversity would be, thata different rule would, or might be promulgated on the590 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.most interesting subjects by the several tribunals ; andthus the citizens be involved in endless doubts, notonly as to their private rights, but as to their public duties.The constitution itself would, or might speak adifferent language according to the tribunal, which wascalled upon to interpret it ; and thus interminable disputesmight embarrass the administration of justicethroughout the whole country. But the same reason didnot apply to the inferior tribunals. These were, therefore,left entirely to the discretion of congress, as to theirnumber, their jurisdiction, and their powers. Experiencemight, and probably would, show good groundsfor varying and modifying them from time to time. Itwould not only have been unwise, but exceedingly inconvenient,to have fixed the arrangement of thesecourts in the constitution itself; since congress wouldhave been disabled thereby from adapting them fromtime to time to the exigencies of the country. But,whatever may be the extent, to which the power ofcongress reaches, as to the establishment of inferior tribunals,it is clear from what has been already stated,that all the jurisdiction contemplated by the constitutionmust be vested in some of its courts, either in anoriginal or an appellate form.^ 828. We next come to the consideration of thosesecurities, which the constitution has provided for thedue independence and efficiency of the judicial department.§ 829. The mode of appointment of the judgeshas necessarily come under reviews, in the examinationof the structure and powers of the executive department.The president is expressly authorized, by andwith the consent of the senate, to appoint the judgesof the Supreme Court. The appointment of theCH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY — TENURE OF OFFICE. 591judges of the inferior courts is not expressly providedfor ; but has either been left to the discretion of congress,or silently belongs to the president, under theclause of the constitution authorizing him to appointall other officers of the United States, whose appointmentsare not herein otherwise provided for."§ 830. The next consideration is the tenure, bywhich the judges hold their offices. It is declaredthat "the judges, both of the Supreme and InferiorCourts shall hold their offices during good behaviour."§ 831. It has sometimes been suggested, that,though in monarchical governments the independenceof the judiciary is essential to guard the rights of thesubjects from the injustice and oppression of thecrown ; yet that the same reasons do not apply to arepublic, where the popular will is sufficiently known,and ought always to be obeyed. A little considerationof the subject will satisfy us, that, so far from thisbeing true, the reasons in favour of the independenceof the judiciary apply with augmented force to republics; and especially to such as possess a written constitutionwith defined powers, and limited rights.^ 832. In the first place, factions and parties arequite as common, and quite as violent in republics, asin monarchies ; and the same safeguards are as indispensablein the one, as in the other, against the encroachmentsof party spirit, and the tyranny of factions.Laws, however wholesome or necessary, arefrequently the objects of temporary aversion, andpopular odium, and sometimes of popular resistance.Nothing is more facile in republics, than for demagogues,under artful pretences, to stir up combinationsagainst the regular exercise of authority. Their selfish592 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.purposes are too often interrupted by the firmness andindependence of upright magistrates, not to make themat all times hostile to a power, which rebukes, and animpartiality, which condemns them. The judiciary, asthe weakest point in the constitution, on which to makean attack, is therefore, constantly that, to which theydirect their assaults ; and a triumph here, aided by anymomentary popular encouragement, achieves a lastingvictory over the constitution itself. Hence, in republics,those, who are to profit by public commotions, or theprevalence of faction, are always the enemies of a regularand independent administration of justice. Theyspread all sorts of delusion, in order to mislead thepublic mind, and excite the public prejudices. Theyknow full well, thai, without the aid of the people, theirschemes must prove abortive; and they, therefore, employevery art to undermine the public confidence, andto make the people the instruments of subverting theirown rights and liberties.§ 833. It is obvious, that, under such circumstances,if the tenure of office of the judges is not permanent,they will soon be rendered odious, not because theydo wrong, but because they refuse to do wrong ; andthey will be made to give way to others, who shall becomemore pliant tools of the leading demagogues ofthe day. There can be no security for the minority inafree government, except through the judicial department.In a monarchy, the sympathies of the peopleare naturally enlisted against the meditated oppressionsof their ruler ; and they screen his victims fromhis vengeance. His is the cause of one against thecommunity. But, in free governments, where the majority,who obtain power for the moment, are supposedto represent the will of the people, persecution, espe-CH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY-tenure OF OFFICE. 593chilly of a political nature, becomes the cause of thecommunity against one. It is the more violent andunrelenting, because it is deemed indispensable to attainpower, or to enjoy the fruits of victory. In freegovernments, therefore, the independence of the judiciarybecomes far more important to the security of therights of the citizens, than in a monarchy ; since it isthe only barrier against the oppressions of a dominantfaction, armed for the moment with power, and abusingthe influence, acquired under accidental excitements,to overthrow the institutions and liberties, which layebeen the deliberate choice of the people.^ 834. In the next place, the independence of thejudiciary is indispensable to secure the people againstthe intentional, as well as unintentional, usurpations ofthe executive and legislative department. It has beenobserved with great sagacity, that power is perpetuallystealing from the many to the few ; and the tendencyof the legislative department to absorb all the otherpowers of the government has always been dweltupon by statesmen and patriots, as a general truth, confirmedby all human experience. If the judges are appointedat short intervals, either by the legislative, or theexecutive department, they will naturally, and, indeed,almost necessarily, become mere dependents upon theappointing power. If they have any desire to obtain,or to hold office, they will at all times evince a desireto follow, and obey the will of the predominant powerin the state. Public justice will be administered with afaultering and feeble hand. It will secure nothing, butits own place, and the approbation of those, who value,because they control it. It will decree, what best suitsthe opinions of the day ; and it will forget, that the preceptsof the law rest on eternal foundations. TheAbr. 75694 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.rulers and the citizens will not stand upon an equalground in litigations. The favourites of the day willoverawe by their power, or seduce by their influence ;and thus, the fundamental maxim of a republic, that itis a government of laws, and not of men, will be silentlydisproved, or openly abandoned.§ 835. In the next place, these considerations acquire(as has been already seen) still more cogencyand force, vi^hen applied to questions of constitutionallaw. In monarchies, the only practical resistance,which the judiciary can present, is to the usurpationsof a single department of the government, unaided, andacting for itself. But, if the executive and legislativedepartments are combined in any course of measures,obedience to their will becomes a duty, as well as anecessity. Thus, even in the free government ofGreat Britain, an act of parliament, combining, as itdoes, the will of the crown, and the legislature, isabsolute and omnipotent. It cannot be lawfully resisted,or disobeyed. The judiciary is bound to carry itinto effect at every hazard, even though it should subvertprivate rights and public liberty. But it is farotherwise in a republic, like our own, with a limitedconstitution, prescribing at once the powers of therulers, and the rights of the citizens. This very circumstancewould seem conclusively to show, that theindependence of the judiciary is absolutely indispensableto preserve the balance of such a constitution. Inno other way can their be any practical restraint uponthe acts of the government, or any practical enforcementof the rights of the citizens. This subject hasbeen already examined very much at large, and needsonly to be touched in this place. No man can deny thenecessity of a judiciary to interpret the constitutionCH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY TENURE OF OFFICE 595and laws, and to preserve the citizens against oppressionand usurpation in civil and criminal prosecutions.Does it not follow, that, to enable the judiciary to fulfilits functions, it is indispensable, that the judges shouldnot hold their offices at the mere pleasure of those,whose acts they are to check, and, if need be, to declarevoid ? Can it be supposed for a moment, thatmen holding their offices for the short period of two, orfour, or even six years, will be generally found firmenough to resist the will of those, who appoint them,and may remove them 7^ 836. The argument of those, who contend for ashort period of office of the judges, is founded uponthe necessity of a conformity to the will of the people.But the argument proceeds upon a fallacy, in supposing,that the will of the rulers, and the will of the peopleare the same. Now, they not only may be, butoften actually are, in direct variance to each other. Noman in a republican government can doubt, that thewill of the people is, and ought to be, supreme. Butit is the deliberate weill of the people, evinced by theirsolemn acts, and not the momentary ebullitions ofthose, who act for the majority, for a day, or a month,or a year. The constitution is the will, the deliberatewill, of the people. They have declared under whatcircumstances, and in what manner it shall be amended,and altered ; and until a change is effected in themanner prescribed, it is declared, that it shall be thesupreme law of the land, to which all persons, rulers,as well as citizens, must bow in obedience. When itis constitutionally altered, then and not until then, arethe judges at liberty to disregard its original injunctions.When, therefore, the argument is pressed, thatthe judges ought to be subject to the will of the peo-596 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.pie, no one doubts the propriety of the doctrine iii itstrue and legitimate sense.5j 837. But those, who press the argument, use itin a far broader sense. In their view, the will of thepeople, as exhibited in the choice of the rulers, is to befollowed If the rulers interpret the constitution differentlyfj-dm the judges, the former are to be obeyed,because they represent the opinions of the people ; andtherefore, the judges ought to be removable, or appointedfor a short period, so aS to become subject tothe will of the people, as expressed by and throughtheir rulers; But is it not at once seen, that this is infact subverting the constitution ? Would it not makethe constitution an instrument of flexible and changeableinterpretation, and hot a settled form of governmentwith fixed limitations ? Would it not become,instead of a supreme law for ourselves and our posteritya mere oracle of the powers of the rulers of theday, to which implicit homage is to be paid, andSpeaking at different times the most opposite commands,and in the most ambiguous voices ? In short,is not this an attempt to erect, behind the constitution,a power unknown, and unprovided for by the constitutionsand greater than itself? What become of thelimitations of the constitution, if the will of the people,thus officially promulgated, forms, for the time being,the Supreme law, and the supreme exposition of thelaw If this constitution defines the powers of thegovernment, and points out the mode of changingthem ; and yet the instrument is tb expand in thehands of one set of rulers, and to contract in those ofanother, where is the standard ? If the will of the peopleis to govern in the construction of the powers ofth constitution, and that will is to be gathered at everyCH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY-tenure OF OFFICE. 697successive election at the polls, and not from their deliberatejudgment, and solemn acts in ratifying theconstitution, or in amending it, what certainty can therebe in those powers 1 If the constitution is to be expounded,not by its written text, bit by the opinions ofthe rulers for the time being, whose opinions are toprevail, the first, or the last? When, therefore, it issaid, that the judges ought to be subjected to the willof the people, and to conform to their interpretation ofthe constitution the practical meaning must be, thatthey should be subjected to the control of the representativesof the people in the executive and legislativedepartments, and should interpret the constitution, asthe latter may, from time to time, deem correct.§ 838. But it is obvious, that elections can rarely, ifever, furnish any sufficient proofs, what is deliberatelythe will of the people, as to any constitutional or legaldoctrines. Representatives and rulers must be ordinarilychosen for very different purposes ; and, in manyinstances, their opinions upon constitutional questionsmust be unknown to their constituents. The onlymeans known to the constitution, by which to ascertainthe will of the people upon a constitutional question, isin the shape of an affirmative or negative propositionby way of amendment offered for their adoption in themode prescribed by the constitution. The elections inone year may bring one party into power ; and in thenext year their opponents, embracing opposite doctrines,may succeed ; and so alternate success and defeatmay perpetually recur in the same districts, and inthe same, or in different states.^ 839. Surely it will not be pretended, that anyconstitution, adapted to the American people, couldtver contemplate the executive and legislative departsCONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.ments of the government, as the ultimate depositariesof the power to interpret the constitution ; or as theultimate representatives of the will of the people, tochange it at pleasure. If, then, the judges were appointedfor two, or four, or six years, instead of duringgood behaviour, the only security, which the peoplewould have for a due administration of public justice,and a firm support of the constitution, would be,that being dependent upon the executive for their appointmentduring their brief period of office, theymight, and would represent more fully, for the time being,the constitutional opinion of each successive executive; and thus carry into effect his system of government.Would this be more wise, or more safe, morefor the permanence of the constitution, or for the preservationof the liberties of the people, than the presentsystem? Would the judiciary, then, be, in fact, anindependent co-ordinate department? Would it protectthe people against an ambitious or corrupt executive; or restrain the legislature from acts of unconstitutionalauthority ?§ 840. The truth iSj that, even with the most securetenure of office, during good behaviour, the dangeris not, that the judges will be too firm in resisting publicopinion, and in defence of private rights or publicliberties ; but, that they will be too ready to yield themselvesto the passions, and politics, and prejudices ofthe day. In a monarchy, the judges, in the performanceof their duties with uprightness and impartiality, willalways have the support of some of the departments ofthe government, or at least of the people. In republics,they may sometimes find the other departments combinedin hostility against the judiciary ; and even thepeople, for a while, under the influence of party spiritCH. XXXVIII.] Judiciary-TENURE OF OFFICE. 599and turbulent factions, ready to abandon them to theirfate. Few men possess the firmness to resist the torrentof popular opinion. Still fewer are content to sacrificepresent ease and public favour, in order to earn theslow rewards of a conscientious discharge of duty ; thesure, but distant, gratitude of the people; and thesevere, but enlightened, award of posterity.§ 841. If passing from general reasoning, an appealis made to the lessons of experience, there is everythingto convince us, that the judicial department issafe in a republic with the tenure of office during goodbehaviour ; and that justice will ordinarily be best administeredwhere there is most independence. Ofthe state constitutions, five only outof twenty-four haveprovided for any other tenure of office, than during goodbehaviour; and those adopted by the new states admittedinto the Union, since the formation of the nationalgovernment, have, with two or three exceptions only,embraced the same permanent tenure of office. No onecan hesitate to declare that in the states, where thejudges hold their offices during good behaviour, justiceis administered with wisdom, moderation, and firmness ;and that the public confidence has reposed upon thejudicial department, in the most critical times, withunabated respect. If the same can be said in regardto other states, where the judges enjoy a less permanenttenure of office, it will not answer the reasoning,unless it can also be shown, that the latter have neverbeen removed for political causes, wholly distinct,from their own merit; and yet have often deliberatelyplaced themselves in opposition to the popularopinion.§ 842. The considerations above stated lead us to theconclusion, that in republics there are, in reality, CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.er reasons for an independent tenure of office by thejudges, a tenure during good behaviour, than in a monarchy.Indeed, a republic with a limited constitutionand yet without a judiciary sufficiently independent tocheck usurpation, to protect public liberty, and to enforceprivate rights, would be as visionary and absurd,as a society organized without any restraints of law. Itwould become a democracy with unlimited powers, exercisingthrough its rulers a universal despotic sovereignty.Tue very theory of a balanced republic ofrestricted powers presupposes some organized meansto control, and resist, any excesses of authority. Thepeople may, if they please, submit all power to theirrulers for the time being ; but, then, the governmentshould receive its true appellation and character. Itwould be ei government of tyrants, elective, it is true?but still tyrants ; and it would become the more fierce,.vindictive, and sanguinary, because it would perpetuallygenerate factions in its own bosom, which could succeedm\y by the ruin of their enemies. It would be alternatelycharacterized, as a reign of terror, and a reignof imbecility. It would be as corrupt, as it would bedangerous. It would form another model of that profligateand bloody democracy, which, at one time, in theFrench revolution, darkened by its deeds the fortuneof France, and left to mankind the appalling lesson,that virtue and religion, genius and learning, the authorityof wisdom and the appeals of innocence, areunheard and unfelt in the frenzy of popular excitement ;and, that the worst crimes may be sanctioned, and themost desolating principles inculcated, under the banners,and in the name of liberty. In human governsments, there are but two controlling powers ; the powerof arms, and the power of laws. If the latter areCH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY-tenure OF OFFICE. 601not enforced by a judiciary above all fear, and aboveall reproach, the former must prevail ; and thus leadto the triumph of military over civil institutions. Theframers of the constitution, with profound wisdom,laid the corner stone of our national republic in thepermanent independence of the judicial establishment.Upon this point their vote was unanimous.They adopted the results of an enlightened experience.They were not seduced by the dreams of human perfectioninto the belief, that all power might be safelyleft to the unchecked operation of the private ambition,or personal virtue of rulers. Nor, on the other hand,were they so lost to a just estimate of human concerns,as not to feel, that confidence must be reposed somewhere; if either efficiency, or safety are to be consultedin the plan of government. Having provided amplyfor the legislative and executive authorities, they establisheda balance-wheel, which, by its independent structure,should adjust the irregularities, and check theoccasional excesses of the movements of the system.§ 843. It is observable, that the constitution has declared,that the judges of the inferior courts, as well asof the Supreme Court, of the United States, shall holdtheir offices during good behaviour. In this respectthere is a marked contrast between the English governmentand our own. In England the tenure isexclusively confined to the judges of the superiorcourts, and does not even embrace all of these.In fact, a great portion of all the civil and criminalbusiness of the whole kingdom is performed by personsdelegated, pro hac vice, for this purpose, undercommissions issued periodically for a single circuit.It is true, that it is, and for a long period has been, ordinarilyadministered by the judges of the courts ofAbr. 76602 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.King's Bench, Common Pleas, and Exchequer ; but itis not so merely virtute officii, but under special commissionsinvesting them from time to time with this authorityin conjunction with other persons named in thecommissions. Such are the commissions of oyer andterminer, of assize, of gaol delivery, and of nisi prius,under which all civil and criminal trials of matters offact are had at the circuits, and in the metropolis. Bythe constitution of the United States all criminal andcivil jurisdiction must be exclusively confided to judgesholding their office during good behaviour ; and thoughcongress may from time to time distribute the jurisdictionamong such inferior courts, as it may create fromtime to time, and withdraw it at their pleasure, it is notcompetent for them to confer it upon temporary judges,or to confide it by special commission. Even if theEnglish system be well adapted to the wants of that nation,and if it secure a wise and beneficent administrationof justice in the realm, as it doubtless does ; still it isobvious, that, in our popular government, it would bequite too great a power, to trust the whole administrationof civil and criminal justice to commissioners, appointedat the pleasure of the president. To the constitutionof the United States, and to those, who enjoyits advantages, no judges are known, but such, as holdtheir offices during good behaviour.§ 844. The next clause of the constitution declares,that the judges of the supreme and inferiour courtsshall, at stated times, receive for their services a compensation,which shall not be diminished during theircontinuance in office." Without this provision theother, as to the tenure of office, would have been utterlynugatory, and indeed a mere mockery. The Federalisthas here spoken in language so direct andconvincing, that it supercedes all other argument.CH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY COMPENSATION. 603§ 845. " Next to permanency in office, nothing cancontribute more to the independence of the judges,than a fixed provision for their support. The remarkmade in relation to the president is equally applicablehere. In the general course of human nature, a powerover a manes subsistence amounts to a power over hisivilL And we can never hope to see realized in practicethe complete separation of the judicial from thelegislative power in any system, which leaves theformer dependent for pecuniary resource on the occasionalgrants of the latter. The enlightened friends togood government in every state have seen cause tolament the want of precise and explicit precautions inthe state constitutions on this head. Some of theseindeed have declared, that permanent salaries shouldbe established for the judges ; but the experiment hasin some instances shown, that such expressions are notsufficiency definite to preclude legislative evasions.Something still more positive and unequivocal has beenevinced to be requisite. The plan of the conventionaccordingly has provided, that the judges of the UnitedStates ' shall at stated times receive for their services acompensation, which shall not be diminished duringtheir continuance in office.'§ 846. " This, all circumstances considered, is themost eligible provision, that could have been devised.It will readily be understood, that the fluctuations inthe value of money, and in the state of society, rendereda fixed rate of compensation in the constitution inadmissible.What might be extravagant to-day, might inhalf a century become penurious and inadequate. It.was therefore necessary to leave it to the discretion ofthe legislature to vary its provisions in conformity tothe variations in circumstances ; yet under such CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.restrictions as to put it out of the power of that body tochange the condition of the individual for the worse. Aman may then be sure of the ground, upon which hestands ; and can never be deterred from his duty bythe apprehension of being placed in a less eligible situation.The clause, which has been quoted, combinesboth advantages. The salaries of judicial offices may,from time to time, be altered, as occasion shall require ;yet so as never to lessen the allowance, with which anyparticular judge comes into office, in respect to him. Itwill be observed, that a difference has been made bythe convention between the compensation of the presidentand that of the judges. That of the former canneither be increased, nor diminished. That of the lattercan only not be diminished. This probably arose fromthe difference in the duration of the respective offices.As the president is to be elected for no more than fouryears, it can rarely happen, that an adequate salary,fixed at the commencement of that period, will notcontinue to be such to its end. But with regard to thejudges, who, if they behave properly, will be securedin their places for life, it may well happen, especially inthe early stages of the government, that a stipend,which would be very sufficient at their first appointment,would become too small in the progress of theirservice.§ 847. " This provision for the support of the judgesbears every mark of prudence and efficacy ; and it maybesafely affirmed, that, together with the permanenttenure of their offices, it affords a better prospect oftheir independence, than is discoverable in the constitutionsof any of the states, in regard to their ownjudges. The precautions for their responsibility arecomprised in the article respecting impeachments. TheyCH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY — COMPENSATION. 605are liable to be impeached for misconduct by thehouse of representatives, and tried by the senate ; and,if convicted, may be dismissed from office, and disqualifiedfor holding any other. This is the only provisionon the point, which is consistent with the necessary independenceof the judicial character ; and is the onlyone, which we find in our own constitution, in respectto our own judges."§ 848. It is almost unnecessary to add, that, althoughthe constitution has, with so sedulous a care,endeavoured to guard the judicial department fromthe overwhelming influence or power of the other coordinatedepartments of the government, it has notconferred upon them any inviolability, or irresponsibilityfor an abuse of their authority. On the contraryfor any corrupt violation or omission of the high trustsconfided to the judges, they are liable to be impeached,(as we have already seen,) and upon conviction tobe removed from office. Thus, on the one hand, a pureand independent administration of public justice isamply provided for; and, on the other hand, anurgent responsibility secured for fidelity to the people.§ 849. The judges of the inferior courts, spoken ofin the constitution, do not include the judges of courtsappointed in the territories of the United States underthe authority, given to congress, to regulate the territoriesof the United States. The courts of the territoriesare not constitutional courts, in which the judicial powerconferred by the constitution on the general government,can be deposited. They are legislative courts,created in virtue of the general sovereignty, which existsin the national government over its territories. Thejurisdiction, with which they are invested, is not a part606 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.of the judicial power, which is defined in the thirdarticle of the constitution ; but arises from generalsovereignty. In legislating for them, congress exercisethe combined powers of the general, and of astate government. Congress may, therefore, rightfullylimit the tenure of office of the judges of the territorialcourts, as well as their jurisdiction ; and it has beenaccordingly limited to a short period of years.§ 850. The second section of the third article containsan exposition of the jurisdiction appertaining tothe judicial power of the national government. Thefirst clause is as follows : " The judicial power shallextend to all cases in law and equity arising underthis constitution, the laws of the United States, andtreaties made, or which shall be made, under theirauthority ; to all cases affecting ambassadors, otherpublic ministers, and consuls ; to all cases of admiraltyand maritime jurisdiction ; to controversies, towhich the United States shall be a party ; to controlverses between two or more states ; between a state"and citizens of another state; between citizens ofdifferent states ; between citizens of the same state,claiming lands under grants of different states ; and"between a state, or the citizens thereof, and foreignstates, citizens, or subjects."§ 851. And first, the judicial power extends to allcases in law and equity, arising under the constitution,the laws, and the treaties of the United States. Andby cases in this clause we are to understand criminal,as well as civil cases.^ 852. The propriety af the delegation of jurisdiction,"in cases arising under the constitution," restson the obvious consideration, that there ought alwaysto be some constitutional method of giving effect toCH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY JURISDICTION. 607constitutional provisions. What, for instance, wouldavail restrictions on the authority of the state legislatures,without some constitutional mode of enforcingthe observance of them ? The states are by the constitutionprohibited from doing a variety of things;some of which are incompatible with the interests ofthe Union ; others with its peace and safety ; otherswith the principles of good government. The impositionof duties on imported articles, the declarationof war, and the emission of paper money, are examplesof each kind. No man of sense will believe, thatsuch prohibitions would be scrupulously regarded,without some effectual power in the government torestrain, or correct the infractions of them. The powermust be either a direct negative on the state laws,or an authority in the national courts to overrule such,as shall manifestly be in contravention to the constitution.The latter course was thought by the conventionto be preferable to the former ; and it is, without question,by far the most acceptable to the states.^ 853. The same reasoning applies with equalforce to "cases arising under the laws of the UnitedStates." In fact, the necessity of uniformity in theinterpretation of these laws would of itself settle everydoubt, that could be raised on the subject. " Thirteenindependent courts of final jurisdiction (says the Federalist)over the same causes is a Hydra in government,from which nothing but contradiction and confusioncan proceed."^ 854. There is still more cogency, if it be possible,in the reasoning, as applied to " cases arising undertreaties made, or which shall be made, under the authorityof the United States." Without this power,there would be perpetual danger of collision, and even608 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.of war, with foreign powers, and an utter incapacity tofulfil the ordinary obligations of treaties. The want ofthis power was (as we have seen) a most mischievousdefect in the confederation ; and subjected the country,not only to violations of its plighted faith, but tothe gross, and almost proverbial imputation of punic insincerity.§ 855. It is observable, that the language is, thatthe judicial power shall extend to all cases in lalo andequity" arising under the constitution, laws, and treatiesof the United States. What is to be understoodby " cases in law and equity," in this clause 7 Plainly,cases at the common law, as contradistinguished fromcases in equity, according to the known distinction inthe jurisprudence of England, which our ancestorsbrought with them upon their emigration, and withwhich all the American states were familiarly acquainted.Here, then, at least, the constitution of the UnitedStates appeals to, and adopts, the common law to theextent of making it a rule in the pursuit of remedialjustice in the courts of the Union. If the remedy mustbe in law, or in equity, according to the course of proceedingsat the common law, in cases arising under theconstitution, laws, and treaties, of the United States,it would seem irresistibly to follow, that the principlesof decision, by which these remedies must be administered,must be derived from the same source. Hitherto,such has been the uniform interpretation and modeof administering justice in the courts of the UnitedStates in this class of civil cases.^ 856. Another inquiry may be, what constitutes acase, within the meaning of this clause. It is clear, thatthe judicial department is authorized to exercise jurisdictionto the full extent of the constitution, laws, andCH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY JURISDICTION. 609treaties of the United States, whenever any questionrespecting them shall assume such a form, that the judicialpower is capable of acting upon it. When it hasassumed such a form, it then becomes a case ; and then,and not till then, the judicial power attaches to it. Acase, then, in the sense of this clause of the constitution,arises, when some subject, touching the constitution,laws, or treaties of the United States, is submittedto the courts by a party, who asserts his rights in theform prescribed by law. In other words, a case is asuit in law or equity, instituted according to the regularcourse of judicial proceedings ; and, when it involvesany question arising under the constitution, laws, ortreaties of the United States, it is within the judicialpower confided to the Union.^ 857. Cases arising under the constitution, as contradistinguishedfrom those, arising under the laws ofthe United States, are such as arise from the powersconferred, or privileges granted, or rights claimed, orprotection secured, or prohibitions contained in theconstitution itself, independent of any particular statuteenactment. Many cases of this sort may easily beenumerated. Thus, if a citizen of one state should bedenied the privileges of a citizen in another state ; if astate should coin money, or make paper money a tender;if a person, tried for a crime against the United States,should be denied a trial by jury, or a trial in the state,where the crime is charged to be committed ; if a person,held to labour or service in one state, under thelaws thereof, should escape into another, and thereshould be a refusal to deliver him up to the party, towhom such service or labour may be due ; in these,and many other cases, the question, to be judicially decided,would be a case arising under the constitution.Ahr. 77610 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.On the other hand, cases arising under the laws of theUnited States are such, as grow out of the legislationof congress, within the scope of their constitutional authority,whether they constitute the right, or privilege,or claim, or protection, or defence, in whole or in part, ofthe party, by whom they are asserted. The same reasoningapplies to cases arising under treaties. Indeed,wherever, in a judicial proceeding, any question arises,touching the validity of a treaty, or statute, or authority,exercised under the United States, or touching theconstruction of any clause of the constitution, or anystatute, or treaty of the United States ; or touching thevalidity of any statute, or authority exercised under anystate, on the ground of repugnancy to the constitution,laws, or treaties, of the United States, it has been invariablyheld to be a case, to which the judicial power ofthe United States extends.§ 858. It has sometimes been suggested, that a case,to be within the purview of this clause, must be one, inwhich a party comes into court to demand somethingconferred on him by the constitution, or a law, or atreaty, of the United States. But this construction isclearly too narrow. A case in law or equity consistsof the right of the one party, as well as of the other,and may truly be said to arise under the constitution,or a law, or a treaty, of the United States, whenever itscorrect decision depends on the construction of either.This is manifestly the construction given to the clauseby congress, by the 25th section of the Judiciary Act,(which was almost contemporaneous with the constitution,)and there is no reason to doubt its solidity orcorrectness. Indeed, the main object of this clausewould be defeated by any narrower construction ; sincethe power was conferred for the purpose, in an espe-CH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY JURISDICTION. 611coal manner, of producing uniformity of construction ofthe constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States.§ 859. Cases may also arise under laws of the UnitedStates by implication, as well as by express enactment; so, that due redress may be administered bythe judicial power of the United States. It is not unusualfor a legislative act to involve-consequences, whichare not expressed. An officer, for example, is orderedto arrest an individual. It is not necessary, nor is itusual, to say, that he shall not be punished for obeyingthis order. His security is implied in the order itself.It is no unusual thing for an act of congress to imply,without expressing, this very exemption from statecontrol. The collectors of the revenue, the carriers ofthe mail, the mint establishment, and all those institutions,which are public in their nature, are examples inpoint. It has never been doubted, that all persons, whoare employed in them, are protected, while in the line oftheir duty ; and yet this protection is not expressed inany act of congress. It is incidental to, and is impliedin, the several acts, by which those institutionsare created; and is secured to the . individuals, employedin them, by the judicial power alone ; thatis, the judicial power is the instrument employed bythe government in administering this security.^ 860. It has also been asked, and may again beasked, why the words, " cases in equity," are foundin this clause ? What equitable causes can grow outof the constitution, laws, and treaties of the UnitedStates 1 To this the general answer of the Federalistseems at once clear and satisfactory. "Thereis hardly a subject of Litigation between individuals,which may not involve those ingredients of fraud,accident, trust, or hardship, which would render the612 CONSTITUTION OF THE U, STATES. [bOOK III.matter an object of equitable, rather than of legal jurisdiction,as the distinction is known and established inseveral of the states. It is the peculiar province, forinstance, of a court of equity, to relieve against whatare called hard bargains. These are contracts, in which,though there may have been no direct fraud or deceit,sufficient to invalidate them in a court of law ; yet theremay have been some undue, and unconscionable advantagetaken of the necessities, or misfortunes of oneof the parties, which a court of equity would not tolerate.In such cases, where foreigners are concernedon either side, it would be impossible for thefederal judicatories to do justice, without an equitable,as well as a legal jurisdiction. Agreements to conveylands, claimed under the grants of different states, mayafford another example of the necessity of an equitablejurisdiction in the federal courts. This reasoning maynot be so palpable in those states, where the formal andtechnical distinction between law and equity is notmaintained, as in this state, where it is exemplified byevery day's practice."§ 861. The next clause, extends the judicial powerto all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers,and consuls." The propriety of this delegationof power to the national judiciary will scarcely be questionedby any persons, who have duly reflected uponthe subject. There are various grades of public ministers,from ambassadors (which is the highest grade,)down to common resident ministers, whose rank, anddiplomatic precedence, and authority, are well known,and well ascertained in the law and usages of nations.But whatever may be their relative rank and grade,public ministers of every class are the immediate representativesof their sovereigns. As such representatives.CH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY JURISDICTION. 613they owe no subjection to any laws, but those of theirown country, any more than their sovereign ; and theiractions are not generally deemed subject to the controlof the private law of that state, wherein they areappointed to reside. He, that is subject to the coercionof laws, is necessarily dependent on that power,by which those laws were made. But public ministersought, in order to perform their duties to theirown sovereign, to be independent of every power,except that by which they are sent ; and, of consequence,ought not to be subject to the mere municipallaw of that nation, wherein they are to exercisetheir functions. The rights, the powers, the duties,and the privileges of public ministers are, therefore,to be determined, not by any municipal constitutions,but by the law of nature and nations, which is equallyobligatory upon all sovereigns, and all states. Whatthese rights, powers, duties, and privileges are, are inquiriesproperly belonging to a treatise on the law ofnations, and need not be discussed here. But it isobvious, that every question, in which these rights,powers, duties, and privileges are involved, is so intimatelyconnected with the public peace, and policy, anddiplomacy of the nation, and touches the dignity andinterest of the sovereigns of the ministers concerned sodeeply, that it would be unsafe, that they should besubmitted to any other, than the highest judicature ofthe nation.§ 862. Consuls, indeed, have not in strictness adiplomatic character. They are deemed mere commercialagents ; and therefore partake of the ordinarycharacter of such agents ; and are subject to the municipallaws of the countries, where they reside. Yet,as they are the public agents of the nation, to which614 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [rook III.they belong, and are often entrusted with the performanceof very delicate functions of state, and as theymight be greatly embarrassed by being subject to theordinary jurisdiction of inferior tribunals, state and national,it was thought highly expedient to extend theoriginal jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to them also.The propriety of vesting jurisdiction, in such cases, insome of the national courts seems hardly to have beenquestioned by the most zealous opponents of the constitution.And in cases against ambassadors, and otherforeign ministers, and consuls, the jurisdiction has beendeemed exclusive.^ 863. The next clause extends the judicial powerto all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction."^ 864. The admiralty and maritime jurisdiction,(and the word, " maritime," was doubdess added toguard against any narrow interpretation of the precedingword, " admiralty") conferred by the constitution,embraces two great 'classes of cases, one dependentupon locality, and the other upon the nature of the contract.The first respects acts or injuries done uponthe high sea, where all nations claim a common rightand common jurisdiction ; or acts, or injuries doneupon the coast of the sea ; or, at farthest, acts and injuriesdone within the ebb and flow of the tide. Thesecond respects contracts, claims, and services purelymaritime, and touching rights and duties appertainingto commerce and navigation. The former is again divisibleinto two great branches, one embracing captures,and questions of prize, arising /M?'e belli; the other embracingacts, torts, and injuries strictly of civil cognizance,independent of belligerent operations.^ 865. By the law of nations the cognizance of allcaptures, jure belly or, as it is more familiarly phrased,CH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY JURISDICTION. 615of all questions of prize, and their incidents, belongsexclusively to the courts of the country, to which thecaptors belong, and from whom they derive their authorityto make .the capture. No neutral nation hasany right to inquire into, or to decide upon, the validityof such capture, even though it should concernproperty belonging to its own citizens or subjects, unlessits own sovereign or territorial rights are violated ;but the sole and exclusive jurisdiction belongs to thecourts of the capturing belligerent. And this jurisdiction,by the common consent of nations, is vested exclusivelyin courts of admiralty, possessing an original,or an appellate jurisdiction. The courts of common laware bound to abstain from any decision of questions ofthis sort, whether they arise directly or indirectly injudgment. The remedy for illegal acts of capture is bythe institution of proper prize proceedings in the prizecourts of the captors. If justice be there denied, thenation itself becomes responsible to the parties aggrieved; and if every remedy is refused, it then becomes asubject for the consideration of the nation, to which theparties aggrieved belong, which may vindicate theirrights, either by a peaceful appeal to negotiation, or by aresort to arms.§ 866. It is obvious upon the slightest consideration,that cognizance of all questions of prize, made underthe authority of the United States, ought to belong exclusivelyto the national courts. How, otherwise, canthe legality of the captures be satisfactorily ascertained,or deliberately vindicated ? It seems not only a natural,but a necessary appendage to the power of war,and negotiation with foreign nations. It would otherwisefollow, that the peace of the whole nation mightbe put at hazard at any time by the misconduct of one616 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.of its members. It could neither restore property uponan illegal capture ; nor in many cases afford any adequateredress for the wrong ; nor punish the aggressor. Itwould be powerless and palsied. It could not perform,or compel the performance of the duties required bythe law of nations. It would be a sovereign withoutany solid attribute of sovereignty ; and move m vinculisonly to betray its imbecility. Even under the confederation,the power to decide upon questions of captureand prize was exclusively conferred in the lastresort upon the national court of appeals. But like allother powers conferred by that instrument, it was totallydisregarded, wherever it interfered with statepolicy, or with extensive popular interests. We haveseen, that the sentences of the national prize court ofappeals where treated, as mere nullities ; and were incapableof being enforced, until after the establishment ofthe present constitution. The same reasoning, whichconducts us to the conclusion, that the national courtsought to have jurisdiction of this class of admiraltycases, conducts us equally to the conclusion, that, to beeffectual for the administration of international justice,it ought to be exclusive. And accordingly it has beenconstantly held, that this jurisdiction is exclusive in thecourts of the United States.^ 867. The other branch of admiralty jurisdiction,dependent upon locality, respects civil acts, torts, andinjuries done on the sea, or (in certain cases) on watersof the sea, where the tide ebbs and flows, without anyclaim of exercising the rights of war. Such are casesof assaults, and other personal injuries; cases of collision,or running of ships against each other ; cases of spoliationand damage, (as they are technically called,) suchas illegal seizures, or depredations upon property;CH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY — JURISDICTION. 617cases of illegal dispossession, or withholding possessionfrom the owners of ships, commonly called possessorysuits ; cases of seizures under municipal authority forsupposed breaches of revenue, or other prohibitorylaws ; and cases of salvage for meritorious services performedin saving property, whether derelict, or wrecked,or captured, or otherwise in imminent hazard frontextraordinary perils.^ 868. It is obvious, that this class of cases has, ormay have, an intimate relation to the rights and dutiesof foreigners in navigation and maritime commerce. Itmay materially affect our intercourse with foreign states ;and raise many questions of international law, not merelytouching private claims, but national sovereignty, andnational reciprocity. Thus, for instance, if a collisionshould take place at sea between an American and aforeign ship, many important questions of public lawmight be connected with its just decision ; for it is obvious,that it could not be governed by the meremunicipal law of either country. So, if a case of recap-vture, or other salvage service performed to a foreignship, should occur, it must be decided by the generalprinciples of maritime law, and the doctrines of nationalreciprocity. Where a recapture is made of a friendlyship from the hands of its enemy, the general doctrinenow established is, to restore it upon salvage, if theforeign country, to which it belongs, adopts a reciprocalrule ; or to condemn it to the recaptors, if the likerule is adopted in the foreign country. And in othercases of salvage the doctrines of international and maritimelaw come into full activity, rather than those ofany mere municipal code. There is, therefore, a peculiarfitness in appropriating this class of cases to thenational tribunals ; since they will be more likely to b^Abr, 78618 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.there decided upon large and comprehensive principles,and to receive a more uniform adjudication ; and thusto become more satisfactory to foreigners.§ 869. The remaining class respects contracts, claims,and services purely maritime. Among these are theclaims of material-men and others for repairs and outfitsof ships, belonging to foreign nations, or to otherstates ; bottomry bonds for monies lent to ships in foreignports to relieve their distresses, and enable themto complete their voyages ; surveys of vessels damagedby perils of the seas ; pilotage on the high seas ; andsuits for mariners' visages. These, indeed, often arisein the course of the commerce and navigation of theUnited States ; and seem emphatically to belong, asincidents, to the power to regulate commerce. Butthey may also affect the commerce and navigation offoreign nations. Repairs may be done, and suppliesfurnished to foreign ships ; money may be lent on foreignbottoms ; pilotage and mariners' wages may becomedue in voyages in foreign employment ; and insuch cases the general maritime law enables the courtsof admiralty to administer a wholesome and promptjustice. Indeed, in many of these cases, as the courtsof admiralty entertain suits in rem, as well as in personam,they are often the only courts, in which an effectualredress can be afforded, especially when it is desirableto enforce a specific maritime Hen.^ 870. So that we see, that the admiralty jurisdictionnaturally connects itself, on the one hand, with ourdiplomatic relations and duties to foreign nations, andtheir subjects ; and, on the other hand, with the greatinterests of navigation and commerce, foreign and domestic.There is, then, a peculiar wisdom in giving tothe national government a jurisdiction of this sort, whichCH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY — JURISDICTION. 619cannot be wielded, except for the general good ; andwhich multiplies the securities for the public peaceabroad, and gives to commerce and navigation the mostencouraging support at home. It may be added, that,in many of the cases included in these latter classes,the same reasons do not exist, as in cases of prize, foran exclusive jurisdiction ; and, therefore, whenever thecommon law is competent to give a remedy in the statecourts, they may retain their accustomed concurrentjurisdiction in the administration of it.^871. We have been thus far considering the admiraltyand maritime jurisdiction in civil cases only.But it also embraces all public offences, committed onthe high seas, and in creeks, havens, basins, and bayswithin the ebb and flow of the tide, at least in such asare out of the body of any county of a state. In theseplaces the jurisdiction of the courts of admiralty overoffences is exclusive ; for that of the courts of commonlaw is limited to such offences, as are committed withinthe body of some county. And on the sea coast,there is an alternate, or divided jurisdiction of the courtsof common law, and admiralty, in places between highand low water mark ; the former having jurisdictionwhen, and as far as the tide is out, and the latter when,and as far as the tide is in, usque ad filum aquae, or tohigh water mark. This criminal jurisdiction of the admiraltyis therefore exclusively vested in the nationalgovernment ; and may be exercised over such crimesand offences, as congress may, from time to time, delegateto the cognizance of the national courts. Thepropriety of vesting this criminal jurisdiction in the nationalgovernment depends upon the same reasoning,and is established by the same general considerations,as have been already suggested in regard to civil cases620 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.It is essentially connected with the due regulation, andprotection of our commerce and navigation on the highseas, and with our rights and duties in regard to foreignnations, and their subjects, in the exercise of commonsovereignty on the ocean. The states, as such, are notknown in our intercourse with foreign nations, and notrecognised as common sovereigns on the ocean. Andif they were permitted to exercise criminal or civil jurisdictionthereon, there would be endless embarrassments,arising from the conflict of their laws, and themost serious dangers of perpetual controversies withforeign nations* In short, the peace of the Union wouldbe constantly put at hazard by acts, over which it hadno control ; and by assertions of right, which it mightwholly disclaim.§ 872. The next clause extends the judicial powerto controversies, to which the United States shall beaparty." It seems scarcely possible to raise a reasonabledoubt, as to the propriety of giving to the nationalcourts jurisdiction of cases, in which the UnitedStates are a party. It would be a perfect novelty inthe history of national jurisprudence, as well as of publiclaw, that a sovereign had no authority to sue in hisown courts. Unless this power were given to theUnited States, the enforcement of all their rights, powers,contracts, and privileges in their sovereign capacitywould be at the mercy of the states* They must beenforced, if at all, in the state tribunals. And therewould not only not be any compulsory power overthose courts to perform such functions ; but there wouldnot be any means of producing uniformity in their decisions.A sovereign, without the means of enforcingcivil rights, or compelling the performance, either civillyor criminally, of public duties on the part of the citizens,CH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY JURISDICTION. 621would be a most extraordinary anomaly. Such a defectwould prostrate the Union at the feet of the states.It would compel the national government to become asupplicant for justice before the judicature of those, whowere by other parts of the constitution placed in subordinationto it.^ 873. The next clause extends the judicial power" to controversies between two or more states ; betweena state and the citizens of another state ; betweencitizens of different states, claiming lands undergrants of different states; and between a stateor the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens, orsubjects." Of these, we will speak in their order.And, first ; "controversies between two or more states."This power seems to be essential to the preservationof the peace of the Union. "History" (says theFederalist,) " gives us a horrid picture of the dissensionsand private wars, which distracted and desolatedGermany, prior to the institution of the imperial chamberby Maximilian, towards the close of the fifteenthcentury ; and informs us at the same time of the vastinfluence of that institution, in appeasing the disorders,and establishing the tranquillity of the empire. Thiswas a court invested with authority to decide finallyall differences among the members of the Germanicbody." But we need not go for illustrations to thehistory of other countries. Our own has presented, inpast times, abundant proofs of the irritating effectsresulting from territorial disputes, and interfering claims,of boundary between the states. And there are yetcontroversies of this sort, which have brought on a borderwarfare, at once dangerous to public repose, andincompatible with the public interests.^ 874. Under the confederation, authority was given622 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.to the national government, to hear and determine,(in the manner pointed out in the article,) in thelast resort, on appeal, all disputes and differences betweentwo or more states concerning boundary, jurisdiction,or any other cause whatsoever. Before theadoption of this instrument, as well as afterwards, veryirritating and vexatious controversies existed betweenseveral of the states, in respect to soil, jurisdiction, andboundary; and threatened the most serious publicmischiefs. Some of these controversies were heardand determined by the court of commissioners, appointedby congress. But, notwithstanding these adjudications,the conflict was maintained in some cases,until after the establishment of the present constitution.^ 875. Before the revolution, controversies betweenthe colonies, concerning the extent of their rights ofsoil, territory, jurisdiction, and boundary, under theirrespective charters, were heard and determined beforethe king in council, who exercised original jurisdictiontherein, upon the principles of feudal sovereignty. Thisjurisdiction was often practically asserted, as in the caseof the dispute between Massachusetts and New-hampshire,decided by the privy council, in 1679; and inthe case of the dispute between New-hampshire andNew-york, in 1764. Lord Hardwicke recognised thisappellate jurisdiction in the most deliberate manner, inthe great case of Penn v. Lord Baltimore, The samenecessity, which gave rise to it in our colonial state, mustcontinue to operate through all future time. Some tribunal,exercising such authority, is essential to prevent anappeal to the sword, and a dissolution of the government.That it ought to be established under the national,rather than under the state, government ; or, to speakCH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY — JURISDICTION. 623more properly, that it can be safely established^underthe former only, would seem to be a position self-evident,and requiring no reasoning to support it. It mayjustly be presumed, that under the national governmentin all controversies of this sort, the decision willbe impartially made according to the principles of justice; and all the usual and most effectual precautionsare taken to secure this impartiality, by confiding it tothe highest judicial tribunal.^ 876. Next ; "controversies between a state andthe citizens of another state." "There are othersources," says the Federalist, "besides interferingclaims of boundary, from which bickering and animositiesmay spring up among the members of theUnion. To some of these we have been witnesses inthe course of our past experience. It will be readilyconjectured, that I allude to the fraudulent laws, whichhave been passed in too many of the states. Andthough the proposed constitution establishes particularguards against the repetition of those instances,which have hitherto made their appearance ; yet it iswarrantable to apprehend, that the spirit, which producedthem, will assume new shapes, that couldnot be foreseen, nor specifically provided against.Whatever practices may have a tendency to distractthe harmony of the states are proper objects of federalsuperintendence and control. It may be esteemedthe basis of the Union, that ' the citizens of eachstate shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunitiesof citizens of the several states.' And if it beajust principle, that every government ought to possessthe means of executing its own provisions by itsown authority, it will follow, that, in order to the inviolablemaintenance of that equality of privileges and624 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.immunities, to which the citizens of the Union willbe entitled, the national judiciary ought to preside inall cases, in which one state, or its citizens, are opposedto another state, or its citizens. To secure the fulleffect of so fundamental a provision against all evasionand subterfuge, it is necessary, that its constructionshould be committed to that tribunal, which, havingno local attachments, will be likely to be impartialbetween the different states and their citizens,and which, owing its official existence to the Union,will never be Hkely to feel any bias inauspicious tothe principles, on which it is founded." It is added,The reasonableness of the agency of the nationalcourts in cases, in which the state tribunals cannot besupposed to be impartial, speaks for it. No manought certainly to be a judge in his own cause, or inany cause, in respect to which he has the least interestor bias. This principle has no inconsiderable weightin designing the federal courts, as the proper tribunalsfor the determination of controversies between differentstates and their citizens."^ 877. And here a most important question of aconstitutional nature was formerly litigated ; and thatis, whether the jurisdiction given by the constitution incases, in which a state is a party, extended to suitsbrought against a state, as well as by it, or was exclusivelyconfined to the latter. It is obvious, that, ifa suit could be brought by any citizen of one stateagainst another state upon any contract, or matter ofproperty, the state would be constantly subjected tojudicial action, to enforce private rights against it inits sovereign capacity. Accordingly at a very early-periodnumerous suits were brought against statesby their creditors to enforce the payment of debts,CH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY — JURISDICTION. 625or other claims. The question was made, andmost elaborately considered in the celebrated case ofChisholm v. Georgia; and the majority of the SupremeCourt held, that the judicial power under theconstitution applied equally to suits > brought % andagainst a state. The learned judges, on that occasion,delivered seriatim opinions, containing thegrounds of their respective opinions. It is not myintention to go over these grounds, though they arestated with great ability and legal learning, and exhibita very thorough mastery of the whole subject.The decision created general alarm among the states ;and an amendment was proposed, and ratified by thestates, by which the power was entirely taken away,so far as it regards suits brought against a state. Itis in the following words : " The judicial power of theUnited States shall not be construed to extend toany suit in law, or equity, commenced or prosecuted^^ against one of the United States hy citizens of"another state, or by citizens, or subjects of anyforeign state." This amendment was construed toinclude suits then pending, as well as suits to be commencedthereafter ; and accordingly all the suits thenpending were dismissed, without any further adjudication.^ 878. Since this amendment has been made, aquestion of equal importance has arisen ; and that is,whether the amendment apples to original suits onlybrought against a state, leaving the appellate jurisdictionof the Supreme Court in its full vigour over allconstitutional questions, arising in the progress of anysuit brought by a state in any state court against anyprivate citizen or alien. But this question will moreproperly come under review, when-we are consideringAbr. 79626 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III,the nature and extent of the appellate jurisdiction ofthe Supreme Court. At present, it is only necessaryto state, that it has been solemnly adjudged, that theamendment applies only to original suits against a state ;and does not touch the appellate jurisdiction of theSupreme Court to re-examine, on an appeal or writ oferror, a judgment or decree rendered in any statecourt, in a suit brought originally by a state against anyprivate person.§ 879. Another inquiry suggested by the originalclause, as well as by the amendment, is, when a stateis properly to be deemed a party to a suit, so as toavail itself of, or to exempt itself from, the operationof the jurisdiction conferred by the constitution. Tosuch an inquiry, the proper answer is, that a state, inthe sense of the constitution, is a party only, when itis on the record as such ; and it sues, or is sued in itspolitical capacity. It is not sufficient, that it mayhave an interest in a suit between other persons, orthat its rights, powers, privileges, or duties, may cometherein incidentally in question. It must be in terms aplaintiff or defendant, so that the judgment, or decreemay be binding upon it, as it is in common suitsbinding upon parties and privies. The point arose inan early stage of the government, in a suit between privatepersons, where one party asserted the land in controversyto be in Connecticut and the other in New-york; and the court held, that neither state could beconsidered as a party. It has been again discussed insome late cases; and the doctrine now firmly establishedis, that a state is not a party in the sense of the constitution,unless it appears on the record, as such, eitheras plaintiff or defendant. It is not sufficient, that itmay have an interest in the cause, or that the partiesCH. Xxxvii.] JtTDICIARY — JURISDICTION. 627before the court are sued for acts done, as agents ofthe state. In short, the very immunity of a state frombeing made a party, constitutes, or may constitute, asolid ground, why the suit should be maintainedagainst other parties, who act as its agents, or claimunder its tide ; though otherwise, as the principal, itmight be fit, that the state should be made a partyupon the common principles of a court of equity.§ 880. The same principle applies to cases, wherea state has an interest in a corporation ; as when it isa stockholder in an incorporated bank, the corporationis still suable, although the state, as such, isexempted from any action. The state does not, bybecoming a corporation, identify itself with the corporation.The bank, in such a case, is not the state,although the state holds an interest in it. Nor will itmake any difference in the case, that the state hasthe sole interest in the corporation, if in fact it createsother persons corporators. An analogous case willbe found in the authority, given by an act of congressto the postmaster-general, to bring suits in his officialcapacity. In such suits the United States are notunderstood to be a party, although the suits solely regardtheir interests. The postmaster-general doesnot, in such cases, sue under the clause giving jurisdiction," in controversies, to which the United Statesshall be a party ; " but under the clause extending thejurisdiction to cases arising under the laws of the UnitedStates.^881. It may, then, be laid down, as a rule, whichadmits of no exception, that in all cases under the constitutionof the United States, where jurisdiction dependsupon the party, it is the party named on therecord. Consequently the amendment above referred628 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.to, which restrains the jurisdiction granted by the constitutionover suits against states, is of necessity limitedto those suits, in which a state is a party on the record.The amendment has its full effect, if the constitution isconstrued, as it would have been construed, had thejurisdiction never been extended to suits broughtagainst a state by the citizens of another state, or byaliens.§ 882. Next. " Controversies between citizens ofdifferent states." Although the necessity of this powermay not stand upon grounds quite as strong, as someof the preceding, there are high motives of state policyand public justice, by which it can be clearly vindicated.There are many cases, in which such a power may beindispensable, or in the highest degree expedient, tocarry into effect some of the privileges and immunitiesconferred, and some of the prohibitions upon states expresslydeclared, in the constitution. For example; itis declared, that the citizens of each state shall be entitledto all the privileges and immunities of citizens ofthe several states. Suppose an attempt is made toevade, or withhold these privileges and immunities,would it not be right to allow the party aggrieved anopportunity of claiming them, in a contest with a citizenof the state, before a tribunal, at once national and impartial? Suppose a state should pass a tender law,or law impairing the obligation of private contracts, orshould in the course of its legislation grant unconstitutionalpreferences to its own citizens, is it not clear,that the jurisdiction, to enforce the obligations of theconstitution in such cases, ought to be confided to thenational tribunals ? These cases are not purely imaginary.They have actually occurred ; and may againoccur, under peculiar circumstances, in the course ofCH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY — JURISDICTION. 629state legislation. What was the fact under the confederation?Each state was obliged to acquiesce inthe degree of justice, which another state might chooseto yield to its citizens. There was not only danger ofanimosities growing up from this source ; but, in pointof fact, there did grow up retaliatory legislation, to meetsuch real or imagined grievances.§ 883. Nothing can conduce more to general harmonyand confidence among all the states, than a consciousness,that controversies are not exclusively to bedecided by the state tribunals ; but may, at the electionof the party, be brought before the national tribunals.Besides ; it cannot escape observation, that thejudges in different states hold their offices by a verydifferent tenure. Some hold during good behaviour ;some for a term of years; some for a single year; someare irremovable, except upon impeachment; and othersmay be removed upon address of the legislature. Undersuch circumstances it cannot but be presumed, thatthere may arise a course of state policy, or state legislation,exceedingly injurious to the interests of the citizensof other states, both as to real and to personal property.It would require an uncommon exercise of candouror credulity to affirm, that in cases of this sort allthe state tribunals would be wholly without state prejudice,or state feelings ; or, that they would be as earnestin resisting the encroachments of state authorityupon the just rights, and interests of the citizens ofother states, as a tribunal differently constituted, andwholly independent of state authority. And if justiceshould be as fairly, and as firmly administered in theformer, as in the latter, still the mischiefs would bemost serious, if the public opinion did not indulge sucha belief. Justice, in cases of this sort, should riot only630 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.be above all reproach, but above all suspicion. Thesources of state irritations and state jealousies are sufficientlynumerous, without leaving open one so copiousand constant, as the belief, or the dread of wrong inthe administration of state justice. Besides ; if thepublic confidence should continue to follow the statetribunals, (as in many cases it doubdess will,) the provisionwill become inert and harmless; for, as the partywill have his election of the forum, he will not be inclinedto desert the state courts, unless for some soundreason, founded either in the nature of his cause, or inthe influence of state prejudices. On the other hand,there can be no real danger of injustice to the otherside in the decisions of the national tribunals ; becausethe cause must still be decided upon the true principlesof the local law, and not by any foreign jurisprudence.There is another circumstance of no small importance,as a matter of policy ; and that is, the tendency of sucha power to increase the confidence and credit betweenthe commercial and agricultural states. No man canbe insensible to the value, in promoting credit, of thebelief of there being a prompt, efficient, and impartialadministration of justice in enforcing contracts.§ 884. The next inquiry growing out of this part ofthe clause is, who are to be deemed citizens of differentstates within the meaning of it. Are all personsborn within a state to be always deemed citizens ofthat state, notwithstanding any change of domicil ; ordoes their citizenship change with their change of domicil? The answer to this inquiry is equally plain andsatisfactory. The constitution having declared-thatthe citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privilegesand immunities of citizens in the several states,every person, who is a citizen of one state, and removesCH, XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY JURISDICTION. 631into another, with the intention of taking up his residenceand inhabitancy there, becomes, ipso facto, a citizenof the state, where he resides; and he thenceases to be a citizen of the state, from which he hasremoved his residence. Of course, when he gives uphis new residence or domicil, and returns to his native,or other state residence or domicil, he re-acquires thecharacter of the latter. What circumstances shall constitutesuch a change of residence or domicil, is an inquiry,more properly belonging to a treatise upon publicor municipal law, than to commentaries upon constitutionallaw. In general, however, it may be said, that aremoval from one state into another, animo manendi, orwith a design of becoming an inhabitant, constitutes achange of domicil, and of course a change of citizenship.But a person, who is a native citizen of onestate, never ceases to be a citizen thereof, until he hasacquired a new citizenship elsewhere. Residence in aforeign country has no operation upon his character, asacitizen, although it may, for purposes of trade andcommerce, impress him with the character of the country.To change allegiance is one thing; to changeinhabitancy is quite another thing. The right and thepower are not co-extensive in each case. Every citizenof a state is, ipso facto, a citizen of the UnitedStates.§ 885. And a person, who is a naturalized citizen ofthe United States, by a like residence in any state inthe Union, becomes, ipso facto, a citizen of that state.So a citizen of a territory of the Union by a like residenceacquires the character of the state, where he resides.But a naturalized citizen of the United States,or a citizen of a territory, is not a citizen of a state,entitled to sue in the courts of the United States in632 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.virtue of that character, while he resides in any suchterritory, nor until he has acquired a residence or domicilin the particular state.§ 886. A corporation, as such, is not a citizen of astate in the sense of the constitution. But, if all themembers of the corporation are citizens, their characterwill confer jurisdiction ; for then it is substantially asuit by citizens suing in their corporate name. And acitizen of a state is entitled to sue, as such, notwithstandinghe is a trustee for others, or sues in autre droit,as it is technically called, that is, as representative ofanother. Thus, a citizen may sue, who is a trustee atlaw, for the benefit of the person entitled to the trust.And an administrator, and an executor may sue for thebenefit of the estate, which they represent ; for in eachof these cases it is their personal suit. But if citizens,who are parties to a suit, are merely nominally so, as,for instance, if magistrates are officially required toallow suits to be brought in their names for the use orbenefit of a citizen or alien, the latter are deemed thesubstantial parties entitled to sue.§ 887. Next. " Controversies between citizens ofthe same state, claiming lands under grants of differentstates." This clause was not in the first draft of theconstitution, but was added without any known objectionto its propriety. It is the only instance, in whichthe constitution directly contemplates the cognizanceof disputes between citizens of the same state ; butcertainly not the only one, in which they may indirectlyupon constitutional questions have the benefit of thejudicial power of the Union. The Federalist has remarked,that the reasonableness of the agency of thenational courts in cases, in which the state tribunalscannot be supposed to be impartial, speaks for itself.CH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY JURISDICTION. 633No man ought certainly to be a judge in his own cause,or in any cause, in respect to which he has the leastinterest or bias. This principle has no inconsiderableweight in designating the federal courts, as the propertribunals for the determination of controversies betweendifferent states and their citizens. And it ought to havethe same operation in regard to some cases betweencitizens of the same state. Claims to land under grantsof different states, founded-upon adverse pretensionsof boundary, are of this description. The courts ofneither of the granting states could be expected to beunblessed. The laws may have even prejudged thequestion ; and tied the courts down to decisions in favourof the grants of the state, to which they belonged.Where this has not been done, it would be natural,that the judges, as men, should feel a strong predilectionfor the claims of their own government. And, atall events, the providing of a tribunal, having no possibleinterest on the one side, more than the other, wouldhave a most salutary tendency in quieting the jealousies,and disarming the resentments of the state, whosegrants should be held invalid. This jurisdiction attachesnot only to grants made by different states, which werenever united; but also to grants made by differentstates, which were originally united under one jurisdiction,if made since the separation, although the originof the title may be traced back to an antecedent period.^ 888. Next. " Controversies between a state, orthe citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens, or subjects."The Federalist has vindicated this provisionin the following brief, but powerful manner: "Thepeace of the whole ought not to be left at the disposalof a part. The Union will undoubtedly be answerableAbr. 80CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.to foreign powers for the conduct of its members.And the responsibility for an injury ought ever to beaccompanied with the faculty of preventing it. Asthe denial or perversion of justice by the sentences ofcourts is with reason classed among the just causes ofwar, it will follow, that the federal judiciary ought tohave cognizance of all causes, in which the citizens ofother countries are concerned. This is not less essentialto the preservation of the public faith, than to thesecurity of the public tranquillity. A distinction mayperhaps be imagined between cases arising upon treatiesand the laws of nations, and those, which maystand merely on the footing of the municipal law. Theformer kind may be supposed proper for the federaljurisdiction ; the latter for that of the states. But itis at least problematical, whether an unjust sentenceagainst a foreigner, where the subject of controversywas wholly relative to the lex loci, would not, if unredressed,be an aggression upon his sovereign, as wellas one, which violated the stipulations of a treaty, orthe general law of nations. And a still greater objectionto the distinction would result from the immensedifficulty, if not impossibility, of a practical discriminationbetween the cases of one complexion, and thoseof the other. So great a proportion of the controversies,in which foreigners are parties, involve nationalquestions, that it is by far the most safe, and most expedient,to refer all those, in which they are concerned,to the national tribunals."^ 889. In addition to these suggestions, it may beremarked, that it is of great national importance toadvance public, as well as private credit, in our intercoursewith foreign nations and their subjects. Nothingcan be more beneficial in this respect, than toCH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY Jurisdiction. 635create an impartial tribunal, to which they may haveresort upon all occasions, when it may be necessaryto ascertain, or enforce their rights. Besides ; it isnot wholly immaterial, that the law to be administeredin cases of foreigners is often very distinct from themere municipal code of a state, and dependent uponthe law merchant, or the more enlarged considerationof international rights and duties, in a case of conflictof the foreign and domestic laws. And it may fairlybe presumed, that the national tribunals will, from thenature of their ordinary functions, become better acquaintedwith the general principles, which regulatesubjects of this nature, than other courts, however enlightened,which are rarely required to discuss them.^ 890. In regard to controversies between anAmerican and a foreign state, it is obvious, that thesuit must, on one side at least, be wholly voluntary.No foreign state can be compelled to become a party,plaintiff or defendant, in any of our tribunals. If,therefore, it chooses to consent to the institution ofany suit, it is its consent alone, which call give effectto the jurisdiction of the court. It is certainly desirableto furnish some peaceable mode of appeal in cases,where any controversy may exist between an Americanand a foreign state, sufficiently important to requirethe grievance to be redressed by any other mode,than through the instrumentality of negotiations.^ 891. The inquiry may here be made, who areto be deemed aliens entitled to sue in the courts ofthe United States. The general answer is, any person,who is not a citizen of the United States. Aforeigner, who is naturalized, is no longer entitled tothe character of an alien. And when an alien is thesubstantial party, it matters not, whether he is a636 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.suitor in his own right ; or whether he acts, as a trustee,or personal representative ; or whether he is compellableby the local law to sue through some officialorgan. A foreign corporation, established in a foreigncountry, all of whose members are aliens, is entitledto sue in the same manner, that an alien may personallysue in the courts of the Union. It is not sufficientto vest the jurisdiction, that an alien is a party to thesuit, unless the other party be a citizen. British subjects,born before the American revolution, are to bedeemed aliens ; and may sue American citizens, bornbefore the revolution, as well as those born since thatperiod. The revolution severed the ties of allegiance ;and made the inhabitants of each country aliens toeach other. In relation to aliens, however, it shouldbe stated, that they have a right to sue only, whilepeace exists between their country and our own. Forif a war break out, and they thereby become alienenemies, their right to sue is suspended, until the returnof peace.§ 892. We have now finished our review of theclasses of cases, to which the judicial power of theUnited States extends. The next inquiry naturallypresented is, in what mode it is to be exercised, andin what courts it is to be vested. The succeedingclause of the constitution answers this inquiry. It isin the following words. " In all cases affecting ambassadors,other public ministers, and consuls, andthose, in which a state shall be a party, the SupremeCourt shall have original jurisdiction. In all theother cases before mentioned, the Supreme Courtshall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and*' fact, with such exceptions and under such regulations,as the congress shall make."CH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY JURISDICTION. 637^ 893. The first remark arising out of this clauseis, that, as the judicial power of the United States extendsto all the cases enumerated in the constitution,it may extend to all such cases in any form, in whichjudicial power may be exercised. It may, therefore,extend to them in the shape of original, or appellatejurisdiction, or both ; for there is nothing in thenature of the cases, which binds to the exercise ofthe one in preference to the other. But it is clear,from the language of the constitution, that, in oneform or the other, it is absolutely obligatory uponcongress, to vest all the jurisdiction in the nationalcourts, in that class of cases at least, where it hasdeclared, that it shall extend to " all cases^ 894. In the next place, the jurisdiction, whichis by the constitution to be exercised by the SupremeCourt in an original form, is very limited, and extendsonly to cases affecting ambassadors, and other publicministers, and consuls, and cases, where a state is aparty. And congress cannot constitutionally conferon it any other, or further original jurisdiction. Thisis one of the appropriate illustrations of the rule, thatthe affirmation of a power in particular cases, excludesit in all others. The clause itself would otherwise bewholly inoperative and nugatory. If it had been intendedto leave it to the discretion of congress, to apportionthe judicial power between the supreme andinferior courts, according to the will of that body, itwould have been useless to have proceeded further,than to define the judicial power, and the tribunals,in which it should be vested. Affirmative wordsoften, in their operation, imply a negative of otherobjects, than those affirmed ; and in this case a negative,or exclusive sense, must be given to the words.638 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.or they have no operation at all. If the solicitude ofthe convention, respecting our peace with foreignpowers, might induce a provision to be made, that theSupreme Court should have original jurisdiction incases, which might be supposed to affect them ; yetthe clause would have proceeded no further, than toprovide for such cases, unless some further restrictionupon the powers of congress had been intended. Thedirection, that the Supreme Court shall have appellatejurisdiction in all cases, with such exceptions, as congressshall make, will be no restriction, unless the wordsare to be deemed exclusive of original jurisdiction.And accordingly, the doctrine is firmly established,that the Supreme Court cannot constitutionally exerciseany original jurisdiction, except in the enumeratedcases. If congress should confer it, it would be amere nullity.^ 895. But although the Supreme Court cannotexercise original jurisdiction in any cases, except thosespecially enumerated, it is certainly competent forcongress to vest in any inferior courts of the UnitedStates original jurisdiction of all other cases, not thusspecially assigned to the Supreme Court ; for there isnothing in the constitution, which excludes such inferiorcourts from the exercise of such original jurisdiction.Original jurisdiction, so far as the constitutiongives a rule, is co-extensive with the judicialpower ; and except, so far as the constitution hasmade any distribution of it among the courts of theUnited States, it remains to be exercised in an original,or appellate form, or both, as congress may in theirwisdom deem fit. Now, the constitution has madeno distribution, except of the original and appellatejurisdiction of the Supreme Court. It has no whereCH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY JURISDICTION. 639insinuated, that the inferior tribunals shall have nooriginal jurisdiction. It has no where affirmed, thatthe J shall have appellate jurisdiction. Both are leftunrestricted and undefined. Of course, as the judicialpower is to be vested in the supreme and inferiorcourts of the Union, both are under the entire controland regulation of congress.^ 896. Another question of a very different natureis, whether the Supreme Court can exercise appellatejurisdiction in the class of cases, of which originaljurisdiction is delegated to it by the constitution ; inother words, whether the original jurisdiction excludesthe appellate ; and so, e converso, the latter implies anegative of the former. It has been said, that thevery distinction taken in the constitution, betweenoriginal and appellate jurisdiction, presupposes, thatwhere the one can be exercised, the other cannot.For example, since the original jurisdiction extendsto cases, where a state is a party, this is the properform, in which such cases are to be brought beforethe Supreme Court ; and, therefore, a case, where astate is a party, cannot be brought before the court,in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction ; for theaffirmative here, as well as in the cases of originaljurisdiction, includes a negative of the cases notenumerated.^ 897. If the correctness of this reasoning wereadmitted, it would establish no more, than that theSupreme Court could not exercise appellate jurisdictionin cases, where a state is a party. But it wouldby no means establish the doctrine, that the judicialpower of the United States did not extend, in an appellateform, to such cases. The exercise of appellatejurisdiction is far from being limited, by the terms of640 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.the constitution, to the Supreme Court. There canbe no doubt, that congress may create a succession ofinferior tribunals, in each of which it may vest appellate,as well as original jurisdiction. This resultsfrom the very nature of the delegation of the judicialpower in the constitution. It is delegated in the mostgeneral terms ; and may, therefore, be exercised underthe authority of congress, under every variety of formof original and appellate jurisdiction. There is nothingin the instrument, which restrains, or limits the power ;and it must, consequently, subsist in the utmost latitude,of which it is in its nature susceptible. Theresult then would be, that, if the appellate jurisdictionover cases, to which a state is a party, could not, accordingto the terms of the constitution, be exercisedby the Supreme Court, it might be exercised exclusivelyby an inferior tribunal. The soundness of anyreasoning, which would lead us to such a conclusion,may well be questioned.^ 898. But the reasoning itself is not well founded.It proceeds upon the ground, that, because the characterof the party alone, in some instances, entitles theSupreme Court to maintain original jurisdiction, withoutany reference to the nature of the case, therefore,the character of the case which in other instances ismade the very foundation of appellate jurisdiction, cannotattach. Now, that is the very point of controversy.It is not only not admitted, but it is solemnly denied.The argument might just as well, and with quite asmuch force, be pressed in the opposite direction. Itmight be said, that the appellate jurisdiction is expresslyextended by the constitution to all cases inlawand equity, arising under the constitution, laws,and treaties of the United States, and, therefore, inCH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY — JURISDICTION. 641no such cases could the Supreme Court exercise originaljurisdiction, even though a state were a party.^ 899. The next inquiry is, whether the eleventhamendment to the constitution has effected any changeof the jurisdiction, thus confided to the judicial powerof the United States. The words of the amendmentare, " the judicial power of the United States shallnot be construed to extend to any suit in law orequity, commenced or prosecuted against one of thestates by citizens of another state, or by citizens orsubjects of any foreign state." It is a part of ourhistory, that, at the adoption of the constitution, allthe states were greatly indebted ; and the apprehension,that these debts might be prosecuted in thefederal courts, formed a very serious objection to thatinstrument. Suits were instituted ; and the SupremeCourt maintained its jurisdiction. The alarm wasgeneral ; and, to quiet the apprehensions, that wereso extensively entertained, this amendment was proposedin Congress, and adopted by the state legislatures.That its motive was not to maintain the sovereigntyof a state from the degradation, supposed toattend a compulsory appearance before the tribunal ofthe nation, may be inferred from the terms of theamendment. It does not comprehend controversiesbetween two or more states, or between a state anda foreign state. The jurisdiction of the court stillextends to these cases ; and in these a state may stillbe sued. We must ascribe the amendment, then, tosome other cause, than the dignity of a state. Thereis no difficulty in finding this cause. Those, whowere inhibited from commencing a suit against astate, or from prosecuting one, which might be commencedbefore the adoption of the amendment, wereAhr. 81642 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK It.persons, who might probably be its creditors. Therewas not much reason to fear, that foreign or sisterstates would be creditors to any considerable amount ;and there was reason to retain the jurisdiction of thecourt in those cases, because it might be essential tothe preservation of peace. The amendment, therefore,extended to suits commenced, or prosecuted by individuals,but not to those brought by states.^ 900. The first impression made on the mind bythis amendment is, that it was intended for thosecases, and for those only, in which some demandagainst a state is made by an individual in the courtsof the Union. If we consider the cause, to which itis to be traced, we are conducted to the same conclusion.A general interest might well be felt inleaving to a state the full power of consulting its conveniencein the adjustment of its debts, or of otherclaims upon it. But no interest could be felt in sochanging the relations between the whole and itsparts, as to strip the government of the means of protecting,by the instrumentality of its courts, the constitutionand laws from active violation.^901. This amendment, then, was designed toprevent any suit being originally commenced hy anyprivate person against a state ; but it was not designedto control or interfere with the appellate jurisdictionof the Supreme Court in cases, to which that appellatejurisdiction extended before the amendment. A case,therefore, originally commenced hy a state against aprivate person in any other court, which involved anyquestion arising under the constitution, laws or treatiesof the United States, might still be revised by theSupreme Court upon an appeal or writ of Error, as thecase might require.CH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY — JURISDICTION. 643^ 902. Another inquiry, touching the appellatejurisdiction of the Supreme Court, of a still more generalcharacter, is, whether it extends only to the inferiorcourts of the Union, constituted by congress, orreaches to cases decided in the state courts. Thisquestion has been made on several occasions ; andhas been most deliberately and solemnly decided by theSupreme Court that it reaches the latter cases.^ 903. We have already seen, that appellate jurisdictionis given by the constitution to the SupremeCourt in all cases, where it has not original jurisdiction; subject, however, to such exceptions and regulations,as congress may prescribe. It is, therefore,capable of embracing every case enumerated in theconstitution, which is not exclusively to be decided bywayof original jurisdiction. But the exercise ofappellate jurisdiction is far from being limited by theterms of the constitution to the Supreme Court.There can be no doubt, that congress may create asuccession of inferior tribunals, in each of which itmay vest appellate, as well as original jurisdiction.The judicial power is delegated by the constitution inthe most general terms, and may, therefore, be exercisedby congress, under every variety of form of appellate,or original jurisdiction. And as there is nothingin the constitution, which restrains, or limitsthis power, it must, therefore, in all these cases, subsistin the utmost latitude, of which, in its own nature,it is susceptible.^ 904. If the constitution meant to limit the appellatejurisdiction to cases pending in the courts ofthe United States, it would necessarily follow, thatthe jurisdiction of these courts would, in all the casesenumerated in the constitution, be exclusive of state644 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.tribunals. How, otherwise, could the jurisdictionextend to all cases, arising under the constitution,laws, and treaties of the United States, or, to all casesof admiralty and maritime jurisdiction ? If some ofthese cases might be entertained by state tribunals,and no appellate jurisdiction, as to them, should exist,then the appellate power would not extend to all, but,to some, cases. If state tribunals might exerciseconcurrent jurisdiction over all, or some of the otherclasses of cases in the constitution, without control,then the appellate jurisdiction of the United Statesmight, as to such cases, have no real existence, contraryto the manifest intent of the constitution. Undersuch circumstances, forgive effect to the judicialpower, it must be construed to be exclusive ; andthis, not only w^hen the casus feeder is should arise directly; but when it should arise incidentally in casespending in state courts. This construction wouldabridge the jurisdiction of such courts far more, thanhas been ever contemplated in any act of congress.^ 905. But it is plain, that the framers of the constitutiondid contemplate, that cases within the judicialcognizance of the United States, not only might, butwould arise in the state courts in the exercise of theirordinary jurisdiction. With this view, the sixth articledeclares, that ' this constitution, and the laws of theUnited States, which shall be made in pursuancethereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made,under the authority of the United States, shall be thesupreme law of the land, and the judges, in everystate, shall be bound thereby, any thing, in the constitutionor laws of any state, to the contrary notwithstanding.'It is obvious, that this obligation is imperativeupon the state judges in their official, andCH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY JURISDICTION. 645not merely in their private capacities. From the verynature of their judicial duties, they should be calledupon to pronounce the law, applicable to the case injudgment. They were not to decide, merely accordingto the laws, or constitution of the state, but accordingto the constitution, laws, and treaties of theUnited States, — ' the supreme law of the land.'^ 906. A moment's consideration will show usthe necessity and propriety of this provision in cases,where the jurisdiction of the state courts is unquestionable.Suppose a contract, for the payment ofmoney, is made between citizens of the same state,and performance thereof is sought in the courts ofthat state ; no person can doubt, that the jurisdictioncompletely and exclusively attaches, in the first instance,to such courts. Suppose at the trial, the defendantsets up, in his defence, a tender under a statelaw, making paper money a good tender, or a statelaw, impairing the obligation of such contract, whichlaw, if binding, would defeat the suit. The constitutionof the United States has declared, that no stateshall make any thing but gold or silver coin a tenderin payment of debts, or pass a law impairing the obligationof contracts. If congress shall not have passeda law, providing for the removal of such a suit to thecourts of the United States, must not the state courtproceed to hear, and determine it ? Can a mere pleain defence be, of itself, a bar to further proceedings,so as to prohibit an inquiry into its truth, or legalpropriety, when no other tribunal exists, to whomjudicial cognizance of such cases is confided ? Supposean indictment for a crime in a state court, andthe defendant should allege in his defence, that thecrime was created by an ex post facto act of the state,CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III-mustnot the state court, in the exercise of a jurisdiction,which has already rightfully attached, have aright to pronounce on the validity, and sufficiency ofthe defence ? It would be extremely difficult, uponany legal principles, to give a negative answer to theseinquiries. Innumerable instances of the same sortmight be stated, in illustration of the position ; andunless the state courts could sustain jurisdiction insuch cases, this clause of the sixth article would bewithout meaning or effect ; and public mischiefs, of amost enormous magnitude, would inevitably ensue.§ 907. It must, therefore, be conceded, that theconstitution, not only contemplated, but meant toprovide for cases within the scope of the judicialpower of the United States, which might yet dependbefore state tribunals. It was foreseen, that, in theexercise of their ordinary jurisdiction, state courtswould, incidentally, take cognizance of cases arisingunder the constitution, the laws, and treaties of theUnited States. Yet to all these cases the judicialpower, by the very terms of the constitution, is toextend. It cannot extend by original jurisdiction, ifthat has already rightfully and exclusively attached inthe state courts, which (as has been already shown)may occur ; it must, therefore, extend by appellatejurisdiction, or not at all. It would seem to follow,that the appellate power of the United States must,in such cases, extend to state tribunals ; and, if insuch cases, there is no reason, why it should notequally attach upon all others within the purview ofthe constitution.^ 908. It is manifest, that the constitution has proceededupon a theory of its own, and given, and withheld,powers according to the judgment of the AmericanCH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY JURISDICTION. 647people, by whom it was adopted. We can only construeits powers, and cannot inquire into the policy,or principles, which induced the grant of them. Theconstitution has presumed (whether rightly or wrongly,we do not inquire) that state attachments, state prejudices,state jealousies, and state interests, mightsometimes obstruct, or control, or be supposed to obstruct,or control, the regular administration of justice.Hence, in controversies between states ; between citizensof different states ; between citizens, claiminggrants under different states ; between a state and itscitizens, or foreigners ; and between citizens and foreigners; it enables the parties, under the authority ofcongress, to have the controversies heard, tried, anddetermined before the national tribunals. No otherreason, than that, which has been stated, can be assigned,why some, at least, of these cases should nothave been left to the cognizance of the state courts.In respect to the other enumerated cases ; casesarising under the constitution, laws, and treaties ofthe United States ; cases affecting ambassadors andother public ministers ; and cases of admiralty andmaritime jurisdiction ; reasons of a higher and moreextensive nature, touching the safety, peace, and sovereigntyof the nation, might w^ell justify a grant ofexclusive jurisdiction.^ 909. This is not all. A motive of another kind,perfectly compatible with the most sincere respect forstate tribunals, might induce the grant of appellatepower over their decisions. That motive is the importance,and even necessity, of uniformity of decisionsthroughout the whole United States upon all subjectswithin the purview of the constitution. Judgesof equal learning and integrity, in different states?648 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.might differently interpret a statute, or a treaty of theUnited States, or even the constitution itself. If therewere no revising authority to control these jarring anddiscordant judgments, and harmonise them into uniformity,the laws, the treaties, and the constitution ofthe United States, would be different in differentstates ; and might, perhaps, never have precisely thesame construction, obligation, or efficacy, in any twostates. The public mischiefs, which would attendsuch a state of things, would be truly deplorable ; andit cannot be believed, that they could have escapedthe enlightened convention, which formed the constitution.What, indeed, might then have been onlyprophecy, has now become fact ; and the appellatejurisdiction must continue to be the only adequateremedy for such evils.^910. There is an additional consideration, whichis entitled to great weight. The constitution of theUnited States was designed for the common and equalbenefit of all the people of the United States. Thejudicial power was granted for the same benign andsalutary purposes. It was not to be exercisedexclusively for the benefit of parties, who might beplaintiffs, and would elect the national forum ; butalso for the protection of defendants, who might beentitled to try their rights, or assert their privileges,before the same forum. Yet, if the appellate jurisdictiondoes not extend to such cases, it will follow, that,as the plaintiff may always elect the state courts, thedefendant may be deprived of all the security, whichthe constitution intended in aid of his rights. Sucha state of things can, in no respect, be considered, asgiving equal rights.^911. Strong as this conclusion stands upon theCH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY JURISDICTION. 649general language of the constitution, it may still derivesupport from other sources. It is an historical fact,that this exposition of the constitution, extending itsappellate power to state courts, was, previous to itsadoption, uniformly and publicly avowed by its friends,and admitted by its enemies, as the basis of their respectivereasonings, both in and out of the state conventions.It is an historical fact, that, at the time,when the judiciary act was submitted to the deliberationsof the first congress, composed, as it was, notonly of men of great learning and ability, but of men,who had acted a principal part in framing, supporting,or opposing that constitution, the same exposition wasexplicitly declared, and admitted by the friends, andby the opponents of that system. It is an historicalfact, that the Supreme Court of the United Stateshave, from time to time, sustained this appellate jurisdictionin a great variety of cases, brought from thetribunals of many of the most important states in theUnion ; and that no state tribunal has ever breatheda judicial doubt on the subject, or declined to obeythe mandate of the Supreme Court, until a late occasion.This weight of contemporaneous expositionby all parties, this acquiescence of enlightened statecourts, and these judicial decisions of the SupremeCourt, through so long a period, places the doctrineupon a foundation of authority, which cannot beshaken, without delivering over the subject to perpetual,and irremediable doubts.§ 912. It would be difficult, and perhaps not desirable,to lay down any general rules in relation tothe cases, in which the judicial power of the courts ofthe United States is exclusive of the state courts, orinwhich it may be made so by congress, until theyAbr. 82650 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.shall be settled by some positive adjudication of theSupreme Court. That there are some cases, in whichthat power is exclusive, cannot well be doubted ; thatthere are others, in which it may be made so by congress,admits of as little doubt ; and that in othercases it is concurrent in the state courts, at least untilcongress shall have passed some act excluding theconcurrent jurisdiction, will scarcely be denied. Itseems to be admitted, that the jurisdiction of thecourts of the United States is, or at least may be,made exclusive in all cases arising under the constitution,laws, and treaties of the United States ; in allcases affecting ambassadors, other public ministersand consuls ; in all cases (in their character exclusive)of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction ; in controversies,to which the United States shall be a party ; incontroversies between two or more states ; in controversiesbetween a state and citizens of another state ;and in controversies between a state and foreign states,citizens, or subjects. And it is only in those cases,where, previous to the constitution, state tribunalspossessed jurisdiction, independent of national authority,that they can now constitutionally exercise a concurrentjurisdiction.^913. In the exercise of the jurisdiction confidedrespectively to the state courts, and to those courts ofthe United States, (where the latter have not appellatejurisdiction,) it is plain, that neither can have anyright to interfere with, or control, the operations ofthe other. It has accordingly been settled, that nostate court can issue an injunction upon any judgmentin a court of the United States ; the latter having anexclusive authority over its own judgments and proceedings.Nor can any state court, or any state leech.XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY JURISDICTION. 651stature, annul the judgments of the courts of theUnited States, or destroy the rights acquired undertheist ; nor in any manner deprive the Supreme Courtof its appellate jurisdiction ; nor in any manner interferewith, or control the process (whether mesne orfinal) of the courts of the United States ; nor prescribethe rules or forms of proceeding, nor effect ofprocess, in the courts of the United States ; nor issuea mandamus to an officer of the United States, tocompel him to perform duties, devolved on him by thelaws of the United States. And although writs ofhabeas corpus have been issued by state judges, andstate courts, in cases, where the party has been incustody under the authority of process of the courtsof the United States, there has been considerablediversity of opinion, whether such an exercise of authorityis constitutional ; and it yet remains to bedecided, whether it can be maintained.^914. On the other hand the national courts haveno authority (in cases not within the appellate jurisdictionof the United States) to issue injunctions tojudgments in the state courts ; or in any other mannerto interfere with their jurisdiction or proceedings.§ 915. Having disposed of these points, we mayagain recur to the language of the constitution for thepurpose of some farther illustrations. The languageis, that "the Supreme ,, Court shall have appellate"jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions,and under such regulations, as the congressshall make."^916. In the first place, it may not be withoutuse to ascertain, what is here meant by appellatejurisdiction ; and what is the mode, in which it maybeexercised. The essential criterion of appellate652 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.jurisdiction is, that it revises and corrects the proceedingsin a cause already instituted, and does notcreate that cause. In reference to judicial tribunals,an appellate jurisdiction, therefore, necessarily implies,that the subject matter has been already instituted in,and acted upon, by some other court, whose judgmentor proceedings are to be revised. This appellate jurisdictionmay be exercised in a variety of forms, andindeed in any form, which the legislature may chooseto prescribe ; but, still, the substance must exist, beforethe form can be applied to it. To operate at all,then, under the constitution of the United States, itis not sufficient, that there has been a decision bysome officer, or department of the United States ; itmust be by one clothed with judicial authority, andacting in a judicial capacity. A power, therefore,conferred by congress on the Supreme Court, to issuea mandamus to public officers of the United Statesgenerally, is not warranted by the constitution ; for itis, in effect, under such circumstances, an exercise oforiginal jurisdiction. But where the object is to revisea judicial proceeding, the mode is wholly immaterial; and a writ of habeas corpus, or mandamus, awrit of error, or an appeal, may be used, as the legislaturemay prescribe.^ 917. The most usual modes of exercising appellatejurisdiction, at least those, which are most knownin the United States, are by a writ of error, or by anappeal, or by some process of removal of a suit froman inferior tribunal. An appeal is a process of civillaw origin, and removes a cause entirely, subjectingthe fact, as well as the law, to a review and a re-trial.A writ of error is a process of common law origin ;and it removes nothing for re-examination, but theCH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY JURISDICTION. 653law. The former mode is usually adopted in cases ofequity and admiralty jurisdiction ; the latter, in suitsat common law tried by a jury.§918. It is observable, that the language of theconstitution is, that " the Supreme Court shall haveappellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact,'^^This provision was a subject of no small alarm andmisconstruction at the time of the adoption of the constitution,as it was supposed to confer on the SupremeCourt, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, thepower to review the decision of a jury in mere mattersof fact ; and thus, in effect, to destroy the validityof their verdict, and to reduce to a mere form the rightof a trial by jury in civil cases. The objection was atonce seized hold of by the enemies of the constitution; and it was pressed with an urgency and zeal,which were well nigh preventing its ratification.There is certainly some foundation, in the ambiguityof the language, to justify an interpretation, that sucha review might constitutionally be within the reach ofthe appellate power, if congress should choose to carryit to that extreme latitude. But, practically speaking,there was not the slightest danger, that congress wouldever adopt such a course, even if it were within theirconstitutional authority ; since it would be at variancewith all the habits, feelings, and institutions of theWhole country. At least it might be affirmed, thatcongress would scarcely take such a step, until thepeople were prepared to surrender all the great securitiesof their civil, as well as of their political, rightsand liberties ; and in such an event the retaining ofthe trial by jury would be a mere mockery. The realobject of the provision was to retain the power of reviewingthe fact, as well as the law, in cases of equity654 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.and admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. And themanner, in which it is expressed, was probably occasionedby the desire to avoid the introduction of thesubject of trial by jury in civil cases, upon which theconvention were greatly divided in opinion.^919. These views, however reasonable they mayseem to considerate minds, did not wholly satisfy thepopular opinion ; and as the objection had a vast influenceupon public opinion, and amendments were proposedby various state conventions on this subject,congress at its first session under the guidance of thefriends of the constitution, proposed an amendment,which was ratified by the people, and is now incorporatedinto the constitution. It is in these words.In suits at common law, where the value in controversyshall exceed twenty dollars, the right of a trialby jury shall be preserved. And no fact tried by ajury shall be otherwise re-examined in any court ofthe United States, than according to the rules of thecommon law." This amendment completely struckdown the objection ; and has secured the right of atrial by jury, in civil cases, in the fullest latitude ofthe common law. It is a most important and valuableamendment ; and places upon the high ground of constitutionalright the inestimable privilege of a trial byjury in civil cases, a privilege scarcely inferior to thatin criminal cases, which is conceded by all persons tobe essential to political and civil liberty.^ 920. The appellate jurisdiction is to be " withsuch exceptions, and under such regulations, as thecongress shall prescribe." But, here, a question ispresented upon the construction of the constitution,whether the appellate jurisdiction attaches to the SupremeCourt, subject to be withdrawn and modifiedCH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY JURISDICTION. 655by congress ; or, whether an act of congress is necessaryto confer the jurisdiction upon the court. If theformer be the true construction, then the entire appellatejurisdiction, if congress should make no exceptionsor regulations, would attach proprio vigore in theSupreme Court. If the latter, then, notwithstandingthe imperative language of the constitution, the SupremeCourt is lifeless, until congress have conferredpower on it. And if congress may confer power, theymay repeal it. So that the whole efficiency of the*judicial power is left by the constitution wholly unprotectedand inert, if congress shall refrain to act.There is certainly very strong ground to maintain,that the language of the constitution meant ito conferthe appellate jurisdiction absolutely on the SupremeCourt, independent of any action by congress ; and torequire this action to divest, or regulate it. The language,as to the original jurisdiction of the SupremeCourt, admits of no doubt. It confers it without anyaction of congress. Why should not the same language,as to the appellate jurisdiction, have the sameinterpretation ? It leaves the power of congresscomplete to make exceptions and regulations ; but itleaves nothing to their inaction. This constructionwas asserted in argument at an earlier period of theconstitution. And it has since been deliberately confirmedby the Supreme Court.^921. The functions of the judges of the courts ofthe United States are strictly and exclusively judicial.They cannot, therefore, be called upon to advise thepresident in any executive measures ; or to give extrajudicialinterpretations of law ; or to act, as commissionersin cases of pensions, or other like proceedings.^ 922. The next clause of the first section of the656 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.third article is : " The trial of all crimes, except incases of impeachment, shall be bj jury ; and suchtrial shall be held in the state, where such crimesshall have been committed. But when not committedwithin any state, the trial shall be at suchplace or places, as the congress may by law havedirected."§ 923. It seems hardly necessary in this place toexpatiate upon the antiquity, or importance of thetrial by jury in criminal cases. It was from veryearly times insisted on by our ancestors in theparent country, as the great bulwark of their civil andpolitical liberties, and watched with an unceasingjealousy and solicitude. The right constitutes one ofthe fundamental articles of Magna Charta, in which itis declared, " nullus homo capiatur, nee imprisoned,aut exult, aut aliquo modo destruatur, ^c. ; nisiper legale judicium parium quorum, vel per legemterrace ; no man shall be arrested, nor imprisoned,nor banished, nor deprived of life, &c. but by thejudgment of his peers, or by the law of the land.The judgment of his peers here alluded to, and commonlycalled, in the quaint language of former times,a trial per pais, or trial by the country, is the trial bya jury, who are called the peers of the party accused,being of the like condition and equality in the state.When our more immediate ancestors removed toAmerica, they brought this great privilege with them,as their birth-right and inheritance, as a part of thatadmirable common law, which had fenced round, andinterposed barriers on every side against the approachesof arbitrary power. It is now incorporatedinto all our state constitutions, as a fundamental right ;and the constitution of the United States would haveCH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY — TRIAL BY Jury 657been justly obnoxious to the most conclusive objection,if it had not recognised, and confirmed it in the mostsolemn terms.§ 924. The great object of a trial by jury in criminalcases is, to guard against a spirit of oppression andtyranny on the part of rulers, and against a spirit of violenceand vindictiveness on the part of the people.Indeed, it is often more important to guard against thelatter, than the former. The sympathies of all mankindare enlisted against the revenge and fury of a singledespot ; and every attempt will be made to screen hisvictims. But it is difficult to escape from the vengeanceof an indignant people, roused into hatred byunfounded calumnies, or stimulated to cruelty by bitterpolitical enmities, or unmeasured jealousies. The appealfor safety can, under such circumstances, scarcelybe made by innocence in any other manner, than bythe severe control of courts of justice, and by the firmand impartial verdict of a jury sworn to do right, andguided solely by legal evidence and a sense of duty*In such a course there is a double security, against theprejudices of judges, who may partake of the wishesand opinions of the government, and against the passionsof the multitude, who may demand their victimwith a clamorous precipitancy. So long, indeed, asthis palladium remains sacred and inviolable, the libertiesof a free government cannot wholly fall. But togive it real efficiency, it must be preserved in its purityand dignity ; and not, with a vieW to slight inconveniences,or imaginary burthens, be put into the handsof those, who are incapable of estimating its worth, orare too inert, or too ignorant, or too imbecile, to wieldits potent armour. Mr. Justice Blackstone, with thewarmth and pride, becoming an Englishman living .83658 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.der its blessed protection, has said : " A celebratedFrench writer, who concludes, that because Rome,Sparta, and Carthage have lost their liberties, thereforethose of England in time must perish, should have recollected,that Rome, Sparta, and Carthage, at the time,when their liberties were lost, were strangers to thetrial by jury."^ 925. It is observable, that the trial of all crimes isnot only to be by jury, but to be held in the state,where they are committed. The object of this clauseis to secure the party accused from being dragged toa trial in some distant state, away from his friends, andwitnesses, and neighbourhood ; and thus subjectedto the verdict of mere strangers, who may feel nocommon sympathy, or who may even cherish animosities,or prejudices against him. Besides this ; a trialin a distant state or territory might subject the party tothe most oppressive expenses, or perhaps even to theinability of procuring the proper witnesses to establishhis innocence. There is little danger, indeed, that congresswould ever exert their power in so oppressive,and unjustifiable a manner. But upon a subject,so vital to the security of the citizen, it was fit to leaveas little as possible to mere discretion. By the commonlaw, the trial of all crimes is required to be in thecounty, where they are committed. Nay, it originallycarried its jealousy still farther, and required, that thejury itself should come from the vicinage of the place,where the crime was alleged to be committed. Thiswas certainly a precaution, which, however justifiablein an early and barbarous state of society, is little commendablein its more advanced stages. It has beenjustly remarked, that in such cases to summon a jury,labouring under local prejudices, is laying a snare forCH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY — TRIAL BY JURY. 659their consciences ; and though they should have virtueand vigour of mind sufficient to keep them upright, theparties will grow suspicious, and indulge many doubtsof the impartiality of the trial. It was doubtless byanalogy to this rule of the common law, that all criminaltrials are required to be in the state, where they werecommitted. But as crimes may be committed on thehigh seas, and elsewhere, out of the territorial jurisdictionof a state, it was indispensable, that, in such cases, con ,dress should be enabled to provide the place of trial.§ 926. But, although this provision of a trial by juryin criminal cases is thus constitutionally preserved to allcitizens, the jealousies and alarms of the opponents ofthe constitution were not quieted. They insisted, thata bill of rights was indispensable upon other subjects,and that upon this, farther auxiliary rights ought to havebeen secured. These objections found their way intothe state conventions, and were urged with great zealagainst the constitution. They did not, however, preventthe adoption of that instrument. But they producedsuch a strong effect upon the public mind, thatcongress, immediately after their first meeting, proposedcertain amendments, embracing all the suggestions,which appeared of most force ; and these amendmentswere ratified by the several states, and are now becomea part of the constitution. They are contained inthe fifth and six articles of the amendments, and are asfollows :No person shall be held to answer for a capital orotherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentmentor indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arisingin the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in"actual service, in time of war, or public danger:nor shall any person be subject, for the same offence.660 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III,to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb ; nor shallbe compelled, in any criminal case, to be a witness"against himself; nor be deprived of life, liberty, or** property, without due process of law ; nor shall privateproperty be alien for public use, without justcompensation."•" In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoythe right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartialjury of the state and district, wherein thecrime shall have been committed ; which districtshall have been previously ascertained by law ; andto be informed of the nature and cause of the accu-<* nation ; to be confronted with the witnesses againsthim ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnessesin his favour ; and to have the assistance ofcounsel for his defence."§ 927. Upon the main provisions of these articles afew remarks only will be made, since they are almostself-evident, and can require few illustrations to establishtheir utility and importance. ,^ 928. The first clause requires the interposition ofa grand jury, by way of presentment or indictment,before the party accused can be required to answer toany capital and infamous crime, charged against him.And this is regularly true at the common law of alloffences, above the grade of common misdemeanors.A grand jury, it is well known, are selected in the mannerprescribed by law, and duly sworn to make inquiry,and present all offences committed against the authorityof the state government, within the body of thecounty, for which they are channelled. In the nationalcourts, they are sworn to inquire, and presentall offences committed against the authority of thenational government within the state or district, forCH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY — TRIAL BY JURY. 661which they are channelled, or elsewhere within thejurisdiction of the national government. The grandjury may consist of any number, not less than twelve,nor more than twenty-three ; and twelve at least mustconcur in every accusation. They sit in secret, andexamine the evidence laid before them by themselves.A presentment, properly speaking, is an accusationmade ex nero motu by a grand jury of an offence upontheir own observation and knowledge, or upon evidencebefore them, and without any bill of indictmentlaid before them at the suit of the government. Anindictment is a written accusation of an offence preferredto, and presented, upon oath, as true, by a grandjury at the suit of the government. Upon a presentmentthe proper officer of the court must frame an indictment,before the party accused can be put to answerit. But an indictment is usually in the first instanceframed by the officers of the government, andlaid before the grand jury. When the grand jury haveheard the evidence, if they are of opinion, that the indictmentis groundless, or not supported by evidence,they used formerly to endorse on the back of the bill,ignoramus," or we know nothing of it, whence thebill was said to be ignored. But now they assert inplain English, " not a true bill," or which is a betterway, " not found ; " and then the party is entitled tobe discharged, if in custody, without farther answer.But a fresh bill may be preferred against him by anothergrand jury. If the grand jury are satisfied of thetruth of the accusation, then they write on the back ofthe bill, " a true bill," (or anciently, " bill verae') Thebill is then said to be found, and is publicly returnedinto court ; the party stands indicted, and may thenbe required to answer the matters charged againsthim.662 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.^ 929. From this summary statement it is obvious,that the grand jury perform most important publicfunctions ; and are a great security to the citizensagainst vindictive prosecutions, either by the government,or by political partisans, or by private enemies.Nor is this all ; the indictment must charge the time,and place, and nature, and circumstances, of the offence,v^ith clearness and certainty ; so that the partymay have full notice of the charge, and be able tomake his defence v^^ith all reasonable knowledge andability.§ 930. Another clause declares, that no person shallbe subject, " for the same offence, to be twice put injeopardy of life and hmb." This, again, is anothergreat privilege secured by the common law. Themeaning of it is, that a party shall not be tried a secondtime for the same offence, after he has once been convicted,or acquitted of the offence charged, by the verdictof a jury, and judgment has passed thereon for, oragainst him. But it does not mean, that he shall notbe tried for the offence a second time, if the jury havebeen discharged without giving any verdict ; or, if,having given a verdict, judgment has been arrestedupon it, or a new trial has been granted in his favour ;for, in such a case, his life or limb cannot judicially besaid to have been put in jeopardy.^931. The next clause prohibits any person frombeing compelled, in any criminal case, to be a witnessagainst himself, or from being deprived of life, liberty, orproperty, without due process of law. This also is butan affirmance of a common law privilege. But it is ofinestimable value. It is well known, that in somecountries, not only are criminals compelled to give evidenceagainst themselves, but are subjected to the rackCH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY — TRIAL BY JURY. 663or torture in order to procure a confession of guilt. Andwhat is worse, it has been (as if in mockery or scorn)attempted to excuse, or justify it, upon the score ofmercy and humanity to the accused. It has been contrived,(it is pretended,) that innocence should manifestitself by a stout resistance, or guilt by a plain confession; as if a man's innocence were to be tried by thehardness of his constitution, and his guilt by the sensibilityof his nerves. Cicero, many ages ago, though helived in a state, wherein it was usual to put slaves tothe torture, in order to furnish evidence, has denouncedthe absurdity and wickedness of the measure in termsof glowing eloquence, as striking, as they are brief.They are conceived in the spirit of Tacitus, andbreathe all his pregnant and indignant sarcasm. Ulpian,also, at a still later period in Roman jurisprudence,stamped the practice with severe reproof.§ 932. The other part of the clause is but an enlargementof the language of magna charta, " nee supereum ibimus, nee super eum mittimus, nisi per legale judiciumparium quorum, vel per legem terrors'' neitherwill we pass upon him, or condemn him, but by thelawful judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land.Lord Coke says, that these latter words, per legem (by the law of the land,) mean by due process oflaw, that is, without due presentment or indictment, andbeing brought in to answer thereto by due process ofthe common law. So that this clause in effect affirmsthe right of trial according to the process and proceedingsof the common law.^ 933. The concluding clause is, that private propertyshall not be taken for public use without just compensation.This is an affirmance of a great doctrineestablished by the common law for the protection of664 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III,private property. It is founded in natural equity, andis laid down by jurists as a principle of universal law.Indeed, in a free government, almost all other rightswould become utterly worthless, if the government possessedan uncontro liable power over the private fortuneof every citizen. One of the fundamental objects ofevery good government must be the due administrationof justice ; and how vain it would be to speakof such an administration, when all property is subjectto the will or caprice of the legislature, and therulers.^ 934. The other article in declaring, that the accusedshall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trialby an impartial jury of the state or district, wherein thecrime shall have been committed, (which district shallbe previously ascertained by ,law,) and to be informedof the nature and cause of the accusation, and to beconfronted with the witnesses against him, does butfollow out the established course of the common law inall trials for crimes. The trial is always public ; thewitnesses are sworn, and give in their testimony (atleast in capital cases) in the presence of the accused ;the nature and cause of the accusation is accuratelylaid down in the indictment ; and the trial is at oncespeedy, impartial, and in the district of the offence*Without in any measure impugning the propriety ofthese provisions, it may be suggested, that there seemsto have been an undue solicitude to introduce into theconstitution some of the general guards and proceedingsof the common law in criminal trials, (truly admirablein themselves) without sufficiently adverting to theconsideration, that unless the whole system is incorporated,and especially the law of evidence, a corruptlegislature, or a debased and servile people, may french.XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY — TRIAL BY JURY. 665der the whole little more, than a solemn pageantry. If,on the other hand, the people are enlightened, andhonest, and zealous in defence of their rights and liberties,it will be impossible to surprise them into a surrenderof a single valuable appendage of the trial byjury935. The remaining clauses are of more directsignificance, and necessity. The accused is entitled tohave compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in hisfavour, and to have the assistance of counsel. A veryshort review of the state of the common law, on thesepoints, will put their propriety beyond question. In thefirst place, it was an anciently and commonly receivedpractice, derived from the civil law, and which Mr. JusticeBlackstone says, in his day, still obtained in France,though since the revolution it has been swept away, notto suffer the party accused in capital cases to exculpatehimself by the testimony of any witnesses. Of thispractice the courts grew so heartily ashamed from itsunreasonable and oppressive character, that anotherpractice was gradually introduced, of examining witnessesfor the accused, but not upon oath ; the consequenceof which was, that the jury gave less creditto this latter evidence, than to that produced by thegovernment. Sir Edward Coke denounced the practiceas tyrannical and unjust ; and contended, that, incriminal cases, the party accused was entitled to havewitnesses sworn for him. The house of commons,soon after the accession of the house of Stuart to thethrone of England, insisted, in a particular bill, thenpending, and, against the efforts both of the crown andthe house of lords, carried a clause affirming the right,in cases tried under that act, of witnesses being swornfor, as well as against, the accused. By the statute ofMr. 84666 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.7 Will. 3, ch. 3, the same measure of justice was establishedthroughout the realm, in cases of treason ; andafterwards, in the reign of Queen Anne, the like rulewas extended to all cases of treason and felony. Theright seems never to have been doubted, or denied, incases of mere misdemeanors. For what causes, andupon what grounds this distinction was maintained, oreven excused, it is impossible to assign any satisfactory,or even plausible reasoning. Surely, a man's life mustbe of infinitely more value, than any subordinate punishment; and if he might protect himself against thelatter by proofs of his innocence, there would seem tobe irresistible reasons for permitting him to do the samein capital offences. The common suggestion has been,that in capital cases no man could, or rather ought, tobe convicted, unless upon evidence so conclusive andsatisfactory, as to be above contradiction or doubt. Butwho can say, whether it be in any case so high, untilall the proofs in favour, as well as against, the partyhave been heard ? Witnesses for the government mayswear falsely, and directly to the matter in charge ; and,until opposing testimony is heard, there may not be theslightest ground to doubt its truth ; and yet, when suchis heard, it may be incontestible, that it is wholly unworthyof belief. The real fact seems to be, that thepractice was early adopted into the criminal law incapital cases, in which the crown was supposed to takea peculiar interest, in base subserviency to the wishesof the latter. It is a reproach to the criminal jurisprudenceof England, which the state trials, antecedentlyto the revolution of 1688, but too strongly sustain.They are crimsoned with the blood of persons, whowhere condemned to death, not only against law, butagainst the clearest rules of evidence.CH. XXXVIII.] JUDICIARY TRIAL BY JURY. 667§ 936. Another anomaly in the common law is, thatin capital cases the prisoner is not, upon his trial uponthe general issue, entitled to have counsel, unless somematter of law shall arise, proper to be debated. Thatis, in other words, that he shall not have the benefit ofthe talents and assistance of counsel in examining thewitnesses, or making his defence before the jury. Mr.Justice Blackstone, with all his habitual reverence forthe institutions of English jurisprudence, as they actuallyexist, speaks out upon this subject with the freespirit of a patriot and a jurist. This, he says, is " arule, which, however it may be palliated under cover ofthat noble declaration of the law, when rightly understood,that the judge shall be counsel for the prisoner,that is, shall see, that the proceedings against him arelegal, and strictly regular, seems to be not all of a piecewith the rest of the humane treatment of prisoners bythe English law. For upon what face of reason canthat assistance be denied to save the life of a man,which is yet allowed him in prosecutions for every pettytrespass." The defect has indeed been cured inEngland in cases of treason ; but it still remains unprovidedfor in all other cases, to (what one can hardlyhelp deeming) the discredit of the free genius of theEnglish constitution.^ 937. The wisdom of both of these provisions is,therefore, manifest, since they make matter of constitutionalright, what the common law had left in a mostimperfect and questionable state. The right to havewitnesses sworn, and counsel employed for the prisoner,are scarcely less important privileges, than the rightof a trial by jury. The omission of them in the constitutionis a matter of surprise ; and their present incorporationis matter of honest congratulation amongall the friends of rational liberty.668 CONSTITUTION OF THE tJ. STATES. [bOOK III.§ 938. There yet remain one or two subjects connectedwith the judiciary, which, however, grow out ofother amendments made to the constitution ; and willnaturally find their place in our review of that part ofthese Commentaries, which embraces a review of the-remainingamendments.CH. XXXIX.] DEFINITION OF TREASON. 669CHAPTER XXXIX.liEFINITION AND EVIDENCE OF TREASON.§ 939. The third section of the third article is asfollows : " Treason against the United States shall concsit only in levying war against them, or in adheringto their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. Noperson shall be convicted of treason, unless on thetestimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, oron confession in open court."^ 940. Treason is generally deemed the highestcrime, which can be committed in civil society, sinceits aim is an overthrow of the government, and a publicresistance of its powers by force. Its tendency is tocreate universal danger and alarm ; and on this accountit is peculiarly odious, and often visited with the deepestpublic resentment. Even a charge of this nature,made against an individual, is deemed so opprobrious,that, whether just or unjust, it subjects him to suspicionand hatred ; and, in times of high political excitement,acts of a very subordinate nature are often, by popularprejudices, as well as by royal resentment, magnifiedinto this ruinous importance. It is therefore, of verygreat importance, that its true nature and limits shouldbe exactly ascertained ; and Montesquieu was so sensibleof it, that he has not scrupled to declare, that ifthe crime of treason be indeterminate, that alone issufficient to make any government degenerate into arbitrarypower. The history of England itself is full ofmelancholy instruction on this subject. By the ancientcommon law it was left very much to discretion to CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.termine, what acts were, and were not, treason ; andthe judges of those times, holding office at the pleasure ofthe crown, became but too often instruments in its handsof foul injustice. At the instance of tyrannical princesthey had abundant opportunities to create constructivetreasons ; that is, by forced and arbitrary constructions,to raise offences into the guilt and punishment of treason,which were not suspected to be such. The grievanceof these constructive treasons was so enormous,and so often weighed down the innocent, and the patriotic,that it was found necessary, as early as thereign of Edward the Third, for parliament to interfere,and arrest it, by declaring and defining all the differentbranches of treason. This statute has ever since remainedthe pole star of English jurisprudence upon thissubject. And although, upon temporary emergencies,and in arbitrary reigns, since that period, other treasonshave been created, the sober sense of the nation hasgenerally abrogated them, or reduced their power withinnarrow limits.^941. Nor have republics been exempt from violenceand tyranny of a similar character. The Federalisthas justly remarked, that newfangled and artificialtreasons have been the great engines, by whichviolent factions, the natural offspring of free governments,have usually wreaked their alternate malignityon each other.§ 942. It was under the influence of these admonitionsfurnished by history and human experience, thatthe convention deemed it necessary to interpose an impassablebarrier against arbitrary constructions, eitherby the courts or by congress, upon the crime of treason.It confines it to two species ; first, the levying ofwar against the United States ; and secondly, adheringCH. XXXIX.] EVIDENCE OF TREASON. 671to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. In sodoing, they have adopted the very words of the Statuteof Treason of Edward the Third ; and thus byimplication, in order to cut off at once all chancesof arbitrary constructions, they have recognised thewell-settled interpretation of these phrases in the administrationof criminal law, which has prevailed forages.^ 943. The other part of the clause, requiring thetestimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, oraconfession in open court, to justify a conviction isfounded upon the same reasoning. A like provisionexists in British jurisprudence, founded upon thesame great policy of protecting men against false testimony,and unguarded confessions, to their utter ruin.It has been well remarked, that confessions are theweakest and most suspicious of all testimony ; everliable to be obtained by artifice, false hopes, promisesof favour, or menaces ; seldom remembered accurately,or reported with due precision ; and incapable, in theirnature, of being disproved by other negative evidence.To which it may be added, that it is easy to be forged,and the most difficult to guard against. An unprincipleddemagogue, or a corrupt courtier, might otherwisehold the lives of the purest patriots in his hands, withoutthe means of proving the falsity of the charge, if asecret confession, uncorroborated by other evidence,would furnish a sufficient foundation and proof of guilt.And wisely, also, has the constitution declined to sufferthe testimony of a single witness, however high, tobe sufficient to establish such a crime, which rousesagainst the victim at once private honour and publichostility. There must, as there should, be a concurrenceof two witnesses to the same overt act, that is,672 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.open act of treason, who are above all reasonable exception.§ 944. The subject of the power of congress todeclare the punishment of treason, and the consequentdisabilities, have been already commented on in anotherplace.CH. XL.] PRIVILEGES OF CITIZENS. 673CHAPTER XL.PRIVILEGES OF CITIZENS FUGITIVES SLAVES.§ 945. The fourth article of the constitution containsseveral important provisions, some of which havebeen already considered. Among these are, the faithand credit to be given to state acts, records, and judgments,and the mode of proving them, and the effectthereof; the admission of new states into the Union;and the regulation and disposal of the territory, andother property of the United States. We shall nowproceed to those, which still remain for examination.§ 946. The first is, "The citizens of each state shallbe entided to all privileges and immunities of citizens"in the several states." There was an article uponthe same subject in the confederation, which declared,that the free inhabitants of each of these states, paupers,vagabonds, and fugitives from justice excepted,shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of freecitizens in the several states ; and the people of eachstate shall, in every other, enjoy all the privileges oftrade and commerce, subject to the same duties, impositions,and restrictions, as the inhabitants thereofrespectively," &c. It was remarked by the Federalist,that there is a strange confusion in this language.Why the terms, free inhabitants, are used in one partof the article, free citizens in another, and people inanother ; or what is meant by superadding to " all privilegesand immunities of free citizens," " all the privilegesof trade and commerce," cannot easily be determined.It seems to be a construction, however, scarcer.85674 CONSTITUTION OF THE r. STATES. [bOOK III.]y avoidable, that those, who come under the denominationof free inhabitants of a state, although not citizensof such state, are entitled, in every other state, toali the privileges oifree citizens of the latter ; that is togreater privileges, than they may be entitled to in theirown state.^ 947. The provision in the constitution avoids allthis ambiguity. It is plain and simple in its language ;and its object is not easily to be mistaken. Connectedwith the exclusive power of naturalization in the nationalgovernment, it puts at rest many of the difficulties,which affected the construction of the article ofthe confederation. It is obvious, that, if the citizens ofeach state were to be deemed aliens to each other, theycould not take, or hold real estate, or other privileges,except as other aliens. The intention of this clausewas to confer on them, if one may so say, a generalcitizenship ; and to communicate all the privileges andimmunities, which the citizens of the same state wouldbe entided to under the like circumstances.^ 948. The next clause is as follows : " A personcharged in any state with treason, felony, or other"crime, who shall flee from justice, and be found inanother state, shall on demand of the executive authorityof the state, from which he fled, be deliveredup, to be removed to the state having jurisdiction ofthe crime." A provision, substantially the same, existedunder the confederation.^ 949. It has been often made a question, howfar any nation is, by the law of nations, and independentof any treaty stipulations; bound to surrender upondemand fugitives from justice, who, having committedcrimes in another country, have fled thither for shelter.Mr. Chancellor Kent considers it clear upon principle,CH. XL.] FUGITIVE SLAVES. 675as well as authority, that every state is bound to denyan asylum to criminals, and, upon application and dueexamination of the case, to surrender the fugitive tothe foreign state, where the crime has been committed.Other distinguished judges and jurists have entertaineda different opinion. It is not uncommon for treatiesto contain mutual stipulations for the surrender ofcriminals ; and the United States have sometimes beena party to such an arrangement.§ 950. But, however the point may be, as to foreignnations, it cannot be questioned, that it is of vitalimportance to the public administration of criminal justice,and the security of the respective states, thatcriminals, who have committed crimes therein, shouldnot find an asylum in other states ; but should be surrenderedup for trial and punishment. It is a powermost salutary in its general operation, by discouragingcrimes, and cutting off the chances of escape from punishment.It will promote harmony and good feelingsamong the states ; and it will increase the generalsense of the blessings of the national government. Itwill, moreover, give strength to a great moral duty,which neighbouring states especially owe to each other,by elevating the policy of the mutual suppression ofcrimes into a legal obligation. Hitherto it has provedas useful in practice, as it is unexceptionable in its character.^ 95 1 The next clause is, " No person held to serviceor labor in one state under the laws thereof,escaping into another shall in consequence of any lawor regulation therein be discharged from such serviceor labour ; but shall be delivered up on the claim of"the party, to whom such service or labour may be« due."676 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.^ 952. This clause was introduced into the constitutionsolely for the benefit of the slave-holding states,to enable them to reclaim their fugitive slaves, whoshould escape into other states, where slavery isnot tolerated. The want of such a provision underthe confederation was felt, as a grievous inconvenience,by the slave-holding states, since in many states no aidwhatsoever would be allowed to the owners ; and sometimesindeed they met with open resistance. In fact,it cannot escape the attention of every intelligent reader,that many sacrifices of opinion and feeling are to befound made by the Eastern and Middle states to thepeculiar interests of the south. This forms no just subjectof complaint ; but it should for ever repress the delusiveand mischievous notion, that the south has not atall times had its full share of benefits from the Union.CH. XLI.] GUARANTY TO THE STATES. 677CHAPTER XLI.GUARANTY OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT MODEOF MAKING AMENDMENTS.§ 953. The fourth section of the fourth article is asfollows : " The United States shall guaranty to everystate in this Union a republican form of government ;and shall protect each of them against invasion ; andon application of the legislature, or of the executive,when the legislature cannot be convened, againstdomestic violence."§ 954. The want of a provision of this nature wasfelt, as a capital defect in the plan of the confederation,as it might in its consequences endanger, if not overthrow,the Union. Without a guaranty, the assistanceto be derived from the national government in repellingdomestic dangers, which might threaten the existenceof the state constitutions, could not be demanded, as aright, from the national government. Usurpation mightraise its standard, and trample upon the liberties of thepeople, while the national government could legally donothing more, than behold the encroachments with indignationand regret. A successful faction might erectatyranny on the ruins of order and law ; while no succourcould be constitutionally afforded by the Union tpthe friends and supporters of the government. Butthis is not all. The destruction of the national governmentitself, or of neighbouring states, might result froma successful rebellion in a single state. Who can determine,what would have been the issue, if the insurrectionin Massachusetts, in 1787, had been successorsCONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.restful, and the malcontents had been headed by aCaesar or a Cromwell 1 If a despotic or monarchicalgovernment were established in one state, it wouldbring on the ruin of the whole republic. Montesquieuhas acutely remarked, that confederated governmentsshould be formed only between states, whose form ofgovernment is not only similar, but also republican.^ 955. The fifth article of the constitution respectsthe mode of making amendments to it. It is in thesewords : '* The congress, whenever two thirds of bothhouses shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendements to this constitution, or, on the application ofthe legislatures of two thirds of the several states,"shall call a convention for proposing amendments,which, in either case, shall be valid to all intents and"purposes, as part of this constitution, when ratified"by the legislatures of three fourths of the severalstates, or by conventions in three fourths thereof, asthe one or the other mode of ratification may be proposedby the congress; provided, that no amendment,which may be made prior to the year one thousandeight hundred and eight, shall in any manner affectthe first and fourth clauses in the ninth section ofthe first article ; and that no state, without its consent,shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in thesenate."^ 956. Upon this subject little need be said topersuade us, at once, of its utility and importance. Itis obvious, that no human government can ever beperfect ; and that it is impossible to foresee, or guardagainst all the exigencies, which may, in different ages,require different adaptations and modifications of powersto suit the various necessities of the people. Agovernment, forever changing and changeable, is, inch.XLI.] MODE OF AMENDMENTS. 679deed, in a state bordering upon anarchy and confusion.A government, which, in its own organization, providesno means of change, but assumes to be fixed and unalterable,must, after a while, become wholly unsuitedto the circumstances of the nation ; and it will eitherdegenerate into a despotism, or by the pressure of itsinequalities bring on a revolution. It is wise, therefore,in every government, and especially in a republic,to provide means for altering, and improving the fabricof government, as time and experience, or the newphases of human affairs, may render proper, in order topromote the happiness and safety of the people. Thegreat principle to be sought is to make the changes practicable,but not too easy ; to secure due deliberation, andcaution ; and to follow experience, rather than to opena way for experiments, suggested by mere speculationor theory.^ 957. In regard to the constitution of the UnitedStates, it is confessedly a new experiment in the historyof nations. Its framers were not bold or rashenough to believe, or to pronounce it to be perfect.They made use of the best lights, which they possessed,to form and adjust its parts, and mould its materials.But they knew, that time might developed manydefects in its arrangements, and many deficiencies inits powers. They desired, that it might be open toimprovement; and under the guidance of the soberjudgment and enlightened skill of the country, to beperpetually approaching nearer and nearer to perfection.It was obvious, too, that the means of amendmentmight avert, or at least have a tendency to avert,the most serious perils, to which confederated republicsare liable, and by which all of them have hitherto beenshipwrecked. They knew, that the besetting sin of680 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.republics is a restlessness of temperament, and a spiritof discontent at slight evils. They knew the pride andjealousy of state power in confederacies ; and theywished to disarm them of their potency, by providinga safe means to break the force, if not wholly to wardoff the blows, which would, from time to time, underthe garb of patriotism, or a love of the people, be aimedat the constitution. They believed, that the power ofamendment was, if one may so say, the safety valve toletoff all temporary effervescences and excitements ;and the real effective instrument to control and adjustthe movements of the machinery, when out of order,or in danger of self-destruction.§ 958. Upon the propriety of the power, in someform, there will probably be little controversy. Theonly question is, whether it is so arranged, as to accomplishits objects in the safest mode ; safest for the stabilityof the government ; and safest for the rights andliberties of the people.§ 959. Two modes are pointed out, the one at theinstance of the government itself, through the instrumentalityof congress ; the other, at the instance of thestates, through the instrumentality of a convention.Congress, whenever two thirds of each house shallconcur in the expediency of an amendment, may proposeit for adoption. The legislatures of two thirdsof the states may require a convention to be called, forthe purpose of proposing amendments. In each case,three fourths of the states, either through their legislatures,or conventions, called for the purpose, mustconcur in every amendment, before it becomes a partof the constitution. That this mode of obtainingamendments is practicable, is abundantly demonstratedby our past experience in the only mode hitherto foundCH. XLI.] MODE OF AMENDMENTS. 681necessary, that of amendments proposed by congress.In this mode twelve amendments have already beenincorporated into the constitution. The guards, too,against the too hasty exercise of the power, undertemporary discontents or excitements, are apparentlysufficient. Two thirds of congress, or of the legislaturesof the states, must concur in proposing, or requiringamendments to be proposed ; and three fourths ofthe states must ratify them. Time is thus allowed,and ample time, for deliberation, both in proposing andratifying amendments. They cannot be carried bysurprise, or intrigue, or artifice. Indeed, years mayelapse before a deliberate judgment may be passedupon them, unless some pressing emergency calls forinstant action. An amendment, which has the deliberatejudgment of two-thirds of congress, and of threefourths of the states, can scarcely be deemed unsuitedto the prosperity, or security of the republic. It mustcombine as much wisdom and experience in its favour,as ordinarily can belong to the management of anyhuman concerns. In England the supreme power ofthe nation resides in parliament ; and, in a legal sense,it is so omnipotent, that it has authority to change thewhole structure of the constitution, without resort toany confirmation of the people. There is, indeed, littledanger, that it will so do, as long as the people arefairly represented in it. But still it does, theoreticallyspeaking, possess the power ; and it has actually exercisedit so far, as to change the succession to the crown,and mould to its will some portions of the internalstructure of the constitution.^ 960. Upon the subject of the national constitution,we may adopt without hesitation the language ofa learned commentator. "Nor," says he, "can weAbr. 86682 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.too much applaud a constitution, which thus providesa safe and peaceable remedy for its own defects, asthey may, from time to time, be discovered. A changeof government in other countries is almost always attendedwith convulsions, which threaten its entire dissolution; and with scenes of horror, which determankind from every attempt to correct abuses, or removeoppressions, until they have become altogetherintolerable. In America we may reasonably hope, thatneither of these evils need be apprehended. Nor isthere any reason to fear, that this provision in theconstitution will produce any instability in the government.The mode, both of originating and ratifyingamendments, (in either mode, which the constitutiondirects,) must necessarily be attended with such obstaclesand delays, as must prove a sufficient bar againstlight or frequent innovations. And, as a further securityagainst them, the same article further provides,that no amendment, which may be made prior to theyear 1808, shall, in any manner affect those clauses ofthe ninth section of the first article, which relate to themigration or importation of such persons, as the statesmay think proper to allow ; and to the manner, inwhich direct taxes shall be laid; and that no stateshall, without its consent, be deprived of its equal suffragein the senate."CH. XLII.] PUBLIC DEBTS. 683CHAPTER XLII.PUBLIC DEBTS SUPREMACY OF CONSTITUTIONAND LAWS.^961. The next clause of the sixth article of theconstitution is : " All debts contracted, and engagementsentered into before the adoption of this constitution,shall be as valid against the United States,under this constitution, as under the confederation."§ 962. This can be considered in no other light,than as a declaratory proposition, resulting from thelaw of nations, and the moral obligations of society.Nothing is more clear upon reason or general law,than the doctrine, that revolutions in government have,or rather ought to have, no effect whatsoever uponprivate rights, and contracts, or upon the public obligationsof nations. It results from the first principles ofmoral duty, and responsibility j^ deducible from the lawof nature, and applied to the intercourse and socialrelations of nations. A change in the political form ofa society ought to have no power to produce a dissolutionof any of its moral obligations.^ 963. This declaration was probably inserted inthe constitution, not only as a solemn recognition ofthe obligations of the government resulting from nationallaw ; but for the more complete satisfaction andsecurity of the public creditors, foreign as well as domestic.The articles of confederation contained asimilar stipulation in respect to the bills of credit emitted,monies borrowed, and debts contracted, by or underthe authority of congress, before the ratification ofthe confederation.684 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.^ 964. The next clause is, "This constitution,and the laws of the United States, which shall bemade in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, orwhich shall be made, under the authority of the UnitedStates, shall be the supreme law of the land. Andthe judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anythingin the constitution or laws of any state to thecontrary notwithstanding."^ 965. The propriety of this clause would seem toresult from the very nature of the constitution. If itwas to establish a national government, that governmentought, to the extent of its powers and rights, to besupreme. It would be a perfect solecism to affirm, that,a national government should exist with certain powers ;and yet, that in the exercise of those powers it shouldnot be supreme. What other inference could havebeen drawn, than of their supremacy, if the constitutionhad been totally silent 1 And surely a positive affirmanceof that, which is necessarily implied, cannot in acase of such vital importance be deemed unimportant.The very circumstance, that a question might be made,would irresistibly lead to the conclusion, that it oughtnot to be left to inference. A law, by the verymeaning of the term, includes supremacy. It is a rule,which those, to whom it is prescribed, are bound toobserve. This results from every political association.If individuals enter into a state of society, the laws ofthat society must be the supreme regulator of theirconduct. If a number of political societies enter into alarger poUtical society, the laws, which the latter mayenact, pursuant to the powers entrusted to it by itsconsdtution, must necessarily be supreme over thosesocieties, and the individuals, of whom they are composed.It would otherwise be a mere treaty, depends.XLII.] SUPREMACY OF LAWS. 685went upon the good faith of the parties, and not a government,which is only another name for political powerand supremacy. But it will not follow, that acts of thelarger society, which are not pursuant to its constitutionalpowers, but which are invasions of the residuaryauthorities of the smaller societies, will become thesupreme law of the land. They will be merely acts ofusurpation, and will deserve to be treated as such.Hence we perceive, that the above clause only declaresa truth, which flows immediately and necessarilyfrom the institution of a national government. Itwill be observed, that the supremacy of the laws isattached to those only, which are made in pursuance ofthe constitution ; a caution very proper in itself, but infact the limitation would have arisen by irresistible implication,if it had not been expressed.§ 966. In regard to treaties, there is equal reason,why they should be held, when made, to be thesupreme law of the land. It is to be considered, thattreaties constitute solemn compacts of binding obligationamong nations ; and unless they are scrupulouslyobeyed, and enforced, no foreign nation would consentto negotiate with us ; or if it did, any want of strictfidelity on our part in the discharge of the treaty stipulationswould be visited by reprisals, or war. It is,therefore, indispensable, that they should have the obligationand force of a law, that they may be executedby the judicial power, and be obeyed like other laws.This will not prevent them from being cancelled orabrogated by the nation upon grave and suitable occasions;for it will not be disputed, that they are subjectto the legislative power, and may be repealed, like otherlaws, at its pleasure ; or they may be varied by newtreaties. Still, while they do subsist, they ought to686 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.have a positive binding efficacy, as laws, upon all thestates, and all the citizens of the states. The peace ofthe nation, and its good faith, and moral dignity, indispensablyrequire, that all state laws should be subjectedto their supremacy. The difference between consideringthem as laws, and considering them as executory,or executed contracts, is exceedingly importantin the actual administration of public justice. Ifthey are supreme laws, courts of justice will enforcethem directly in all cases, to which they can be judiciallyapplied, in opposition to all state laws, as we allknow was done in the case of the British debts securedby the treaty of 1 783, after the constitution was adopted.If they are deemed but solemn compacts, promissoryin their nature and obligation, courts of justicemay be embarrassed in enforcing them, and may becompelled to leave the redress to be administeredthrough other departments of the government. It isnotorious, that treaty stipulations (especially those ofthe treaty of peace of 1783) were grossly disregardedby the states under the confederation. They weredeemed by the states, not as laws, but like requisitions,of mere moral obligation, and dependent upon the goodwillof the states for their execution. Congress, indeed,remonstrated against this construction, as unfounded inprinciple and justice. But their voice was not heard.Power and right were separated ; the argument wasall on one side ; but the power was on the other, ftwas probably to obviate this very difficulty, that thisclause was inserted in the constitution ; and it wouldredound to the immortal honour of its authors, if it haddone no more, than thus to bring treaties within thesanctuary of justice, as laws of supreme obligation.There are, indeed, still cases, in which courts of justiceCH. XLII.] SUPREMACY OF LAWS. 687can administer no effectual redress; for when the termsof a stipulation import a contract, as when either of theparties engages to perform a particular act, the treatyaddresses itself to the political, and not to the judicial,department ; and the legislature must execute the contract,before it can become a rule for the courts.§ 967. From this supremacy of the constitutionand laws and treaties of the United States, withintheir constitutional scope, arises the duty of courts ofjustice to declare any unconstitutional law, passed bycongress, or by a state legislature, void. So, in likemanner, the same duty arises, whenever any otherdepartment of the national or state governments exceedsits constitutional functions. But the judiciaryof the United States has no general jurisdiction todeclare acts of the several states void, unless theyare repugnant to the constitution of the United States,notwithstanding they are repugnant to the state constitution.Such a power belongs to it only, when itsits to administer the local law of a state, and actsexactly, as the state tribunal is bound to act. Butupon this subject it seems unnecessary to dwell, sincethe right of all courts, state as well as national, todeclare unconstitutional laws void, is now settled beyondthe reach of judicial controversy.688 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.CHAPTER XLIII.OATHS OF OFFICE RELIGIOUS TEST — RatificationOF CONSTITUTION.§ 968. The next clause is, "The senators andrepresentatives before mentioned, and the members"of the several state legislatures and all executiveand judicial officers, both of the United States and"of the several states, shall be bound by oath or"affirmation to support the constitution. But no"religious test shall ever be required as a qualificationto any office or public trust under the UnitedStates."§ 969. That all those, who are entrusted v^ith theexecution of the powers of the national government,should be bound by some solemn obligation to thedue execution of the trusts reposed in them, and tosupport the constitution, would seem to be a propositiontoo clear to render any reasoning necessary insupport of it. It results from the plain right of societyto require some guaranty from every officer, that he willbe conscientious in the discharge of his duty. Oathshave a solemn obligation upon the minds of all reflectingmen, and especially upon those, who feel adeep sense of accountability to a Supreme being. If,in the ordinary administration of justice in cases ofprivate rights, or personal claims, oaths are required ofthose, who try, as well as of those, who give testimony,to guard against malice, falsehood, and evasion, surelylike guards ought to be interposed in the administrationof high public trusts, and especially m such, asCH. XLIII.] OATH OF OFFICE. 689may concern the welfare and safety of the whole community.But there are known denominations of men,who are conscientiously scrupulous of taking oaths(among which is that pure and distinguished sect ofChristians, commonly called Friends, or Quakers,)and therefore, to prevent any unjustifiable exclusionfrom office, the constitution has permitted a solemnaffirmation to be made instead of an oath, and as itsequivalent.^ 970. But it may not appear to all persons quiteso clear, why the officers of the state governmentsshould be equally bound to take a like oath, or affirmation; and it has been even suggested, that thereis no more reason to require that, than to require,that all of the United States officers should take anoath or affirmation to support the state constitutions.A moment's reflection will show sufficient reasons forthe requisition of it in the one case, and the omissionof it in the other. The members and officers of thenational government have no agency in carrying intoeffect the state constitutions. The members andofficers of the state governments have an essentialagency in giving effect to the national constitution.The election of the president and the senate will depend,in all cases, upon the legislatures of the severalstates ; and, in many cases, the election of the houseof representatives may be affected by their agency.The judges of the state courts will frequently be calledupon to decide upon the constitution, and laws, andtreaties of the United States; and upon rights and claimsgrowing out of them. Decisions ought to be, as far aspossible, uniform ; and uniformity of obligation willgreatly tend to such a result. The executive authorityof the several states may be often called upon to exertAbr. 87690 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK Ils.powers, or allow rights, given by the constitution, asin filling vacancies in the senate, during the recess ofthe legislature ; in issuing writs of election to fill vacanciesin the house of representatives ; in offering themilitia, and giving effect to laws for calling them ; andin the surrender of fugitives from justice. These, andmany other functions, devolving on the state authorities,render it highly important, that they should be under asolemn obligation to obey the constitution. In commonsense,there can be no well-founded objection to it.There may be serious evils growing out of an oppositecourse.^ 971, The remaining part of the clause declares,that "no religious test shall ever be required, as aqualification to any office or public trust, under theUnited States." This clause is not introducedmerely for the purpose of satisfying the scruples ofmany respectable persons, who feel an invincible repugnanceto any religious test, or affirmation. It hada higher object ; to cut off for ever every pretence ofany alliance between church and state in the nationalgovernment. The framers of the constitution werefuUv sensible of the dangers from this source, markedout in the history of other ages and countries ; andnot wholly unknown to our own. They knew, thatbigotry was unceasingly vigilant in its stratagems, tosecure to itself an exclusive ascendency over thehuman mind ; and that intolerance was ever readyto arm itself v/ith all the terrors of the civil power toexterminate those, who doubted its dogmas, or resistedits infallibility. The Catholic and the Protestanthad alternately waged the most ferocious and unrelentingwarfare on each other ; and Protestantismitself, at the very moment, when it was proclaimingCH. XLIII.] RATIFICATION OF CONSTITUTION. 691the right of private judgment, prescribed boundariesto that right, beyond which if any one dared to pass,he must seal his rashness with the blood of martyrdom.The history of the parent country, too, couldnot fail to instruct them in the uses, and the abuses ofreligious tests. They there found the pains andpenalties of non-conformity written in no equivocallanguage, and enforced with a stern and vindictivejealousy.§ 972. Of the English laws respecting papists,Montesquieu observes, that they are so rigorous,though not professedly • of the sanguinary kind, thatthey do all the hurt, that can possibly be done in coldblood. To this just rebuke, (after citing it, and admittingits truth,) Mr. Justice Blackstone has no better replyto make, than that these laws are seldom exertedto their utmost rigour ; and, indeed, if they were, itwould be very difficult to excuse them. The meanestapologist of the worst enormities of a Roman emperorcould not have shadowed out a defence more servile,or more unworthy of the dignity and spirit of afreeman. It was easy to foresee, that without some prohibitionof religious tests, a successful sect, in ourcountry, might, by once possessing power, pass test-laws,which would secure to themselves a monopoly ofall the offices of trust and profit, under the nationalgovernment.^973. The seventh and last article of the constitutionis: "The ratification of the conventions ofnine states shall be sufficient for the establishmentof this constitution between the states so ratifyingthe same."^ 974. Upon this article it is now wholly unnecessaryto bestow much commentary, since the692 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.constitution has been ratified by all the states. If aratification had been required of all the states, insteadof nine, as a condition precedent, to give it life andmotion, it is now known, that it would never havebeen ratified. North Carolina in her first conventionrejected it ; and Rhode-island did not accede toit,until more than a year after it had been in operation.§ 975. And here closes our review of the constitutionin the original form, in which it was framed for,and adopted by, the people of the United States. Theconcluding passage of it is, " Done in convention bythe unanimous consent of all the states present, theseventeenth day of September, in the year of our Lordone thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven, and ofthe Independence of the United States of America,the twelfth." At the head of the illustrious men, whoframed, and signed it, (men, who have earned theeternal gratitude of their country,) stands the name ofGeorge Washington, " President and Deputy fromVirginia ; " a name, at the utterance of which envy isdumb, and pride bows with involuntary reverence, andpiety, with eyes lifted to heaven, breathes forth a prayerof profound gratitude.CH. XLIV.] AMENDMENTS BILL OF RIGHTS. 693CHAPTER XLIV.AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION.§ 976. We have already had occasion to take noticeof some of the amendments made to the constitution,subsequent to its adoption, in the progress ofour review of the provisions of the original instrument.The present chapter weill be devoted to a considerationof those, which have not fallen within the scope of ourformer commentaries.^ 977. It has been already stated, that many objectionswere taken to the constitution, not only onaccount of its actual provisions, but also on accountof its deficiencies and omissions. Among the latter,none were proclaimed with more zeal, and pressedwith more effect, than the want of a bill of rights.This, it was said, was a fatal defect ; and sufficient ofitself to bring on the ruin of the republic. To thisobjection several answers were given ; first, that theconstitution did in fact contain many provisions in thenature of a bill of rights, if the whole constitutionwas not in fact a bill of rights ; secondly, that a billof rights was in its nature more adapted to a monarchy,than to a government, professedly founded uponthe will of the people, and executed by their immediaterepresentatives and agents ; and, thirdly, that aformal bill of rights, beyond what was contained in it,was wholly unnecessary, and might even be dangerous.^ 978. It was further added, that in truth the constitutionitself was, in every rational sense, and toevery useful purpose, a bill of rights for the Union.694 Constitution OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.It specifies, and declares the political privileges of thecitizens in the structure and administration of thegovernment. It defines certain immunities and modesof proceeding, which relate to their personal, private,and public rights and concerns. It confers on themthe unalienable right of electing their rulers; andprohibits any tyrannical measures, and vindictive prosecutions.So, that, at best, much of the force of theobjection rests on mere nominal distinctions, or upon adesire to make a frame of government a code to regulaterights and remedies.^ 979. Although it must be conceded, that there ismuch intrinsic force in this reasoning, it cannot incandour be admitted to be wholly satisfactory, orconclusive on the subject. It is rather the argumentof an able advocate, than the reasoning of a constitutionalstatesman. In the first place, a bill of rights(in the very sense of this reasoning) is admitted insome cases to be important ; and the constitution itselfadopts, and establishes its propriety to the extentof its actual provisions. Every reason, whichestablishes the propriety of any provision of this sortin the constitution, such as a right of trial by jury incriminal cases, is," pro tanto proof, that it is neitherunnecessary nor dangerous. It reduces the questionto the consideration, not whether any bill of rights isnecessary, but what such a bill of rights should properlycontain. This is a point for argument, uponwhich different minds may arrive at different conclusions.That a bill of rights may contain too manyenumerations, and especially such, as more correctlybelong to the ordinary legislation of a government,cannot be doubted. Some of our state bills of rightcontain clauses of this description, being either inCH. XLIV.] AMENDMENTS BILL OF RIGHTS. 695their character and phraseology quite too loose, andgeneral, and ambiguous ; or covering doctrines quitedebateable, both in theory and practice ; or even leadingto mischievous consequences, by restricting thelegislative power under circumstances, which were notforeseen, and if foreseen, the restraint would have beenpronounced by all persons inexpedient, and perhapsunjust. Indeed, the rage of theorists to make constitutionsa vehicle for the conveyance of their owncrude, and visionary aphorisms of government, requiresto be guarded against with the most unceasing vigilance.^ 980. In the next place, a bill of rights is important,and may often be indispensable, whenever it operates,as a qualification upon powers, actually grantedby the people to the government. This is the realground of all the bills of rights in the parent country,in the colonial constitutions and laws, and in the stateconstitutions. In England, the bills of rights werenot demanded merely of the crown, as withdrawingpower from the royal prerogative ; they were equallyimportant, as withdrawing power from parliament.A large proportion of the most valuable of the provisionsin Magna Charta, and the bill of rights of1688, consists of a solemn recognition of limitationsupon the power of parliament ; that is, a declaration,that parliament ought not to abolish," or restrict thoserights. Such are the right of trial by jury ; the rightto personal liberty and private property according tothe law of the land ; that the subjects ought to havea right to bear arms ; that elections of members ofparliament ought to be free ; that freedom of speechand debate in parliament ought not to be impeached,or questioned elsewhere; and that excessive bail696 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed,nor cruel or unusual punishments inflicted. Whenever,then, a general power exists, or is granted to agovernment, which may in its actual exercise or abusebe dangerous to the people, there seems a peculiarpropriety in restricting its operations, and in exceptingfrom it some at least of the most mischievous forms, inwhich it may be likely to be abused. And the very exceptionin such cases will operate with a silent, but irresistibleinfluence to control the actual abuse of it inother analogous cases.^ 981. In the next place, a bill of rights may beimportant, even when it goes beyond powers supposedto be granted. It is not always possible to foreseethe extent of the actual reach of certain powers,which are given in general terms. They may beconstrued to extend (and perhaps fairly) to certainclasses of cases, which did not at first appear to bewithin them. A bill of rights, then, operates, as aguard upon any extravagant or undue extention ofsuch powers. Besides ; (as has been justly remarked,)a bill of rights is of real efficiency in controllingthe excesses of party spirit. It serves to guide, andenlighten public opinion, and to render it more quickto detect, and more resolute to resist, attempts todisturb private rights. It requires more than ordinaryhardihood and audacity of character, to trampledo\^^n principles, which our ancestors have consecratedwith reverence ; which we have imbibed in our earlyeducation ; which recommend themselves to the judgmentof the world by their truth and simplicity ; andwhich are constantly placed before the eyes of thepeople, accompanied with the imposing force andsolemnity of a constitutional sanction. Bills of rightsCH. XLIV.] AMENDMENTS BILL OF RIGHTS. 697are a part of the muniments of freemen, showing theirtitle to protection ; and they become of increasedvalue, when placed under the protection of an independentjudiciary instituted, as the appropriate guardianof the public and private rights of the citizens.^ 982. In the next place, a bill of rights is an importantprotection against unjust and oppressive conducton the part of the majority of the people themselves.In a government modified, like that of theUnited States, (it has been said by a great statesman,)the great danger lies rather in the abuse of the community,than of the legislative body. The prescriptionsin favour of liberty ought to be levelled against thatquarter, where the greatest danger lies, namely, thatwhich possesses the highest prerogative of power.But this is not found in the executive or legislative departmentsof government ; but in the body of thepeople, operating by the majority against the minority.It may be thought, that all paper barriers against thepower of the community are too weak to be worthy ofattention. They are not so strong, as to satisfy all, whohave seen, and examined thoroughly the texture ofsuch a defence. Yet, as they have a tendency to impresssome degree of respect for them, to establish thepublic opinion in their favour, and to rouse the attentionof the whole community, it may be one means to controlthe majority from those acts, to which they might beotherwise inclined.^ 983. The want of a bill of rights, then, is noteither an unfounded or illusory objection. The realquestion is not, whether every sort of right or privilegeor claim ought to be affirmed in a constitution ; butwhether such, as in their own nature are of vital importance,and peculiarly susceptible of abuse, oughtAbr. 88698 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.not to receive this solemn sanction. Doubtless, thewant of a formal bill of rights in the constitution wasa matter of very exaggerated declamation, and partyzeal, for the mere purpose of defeating the constitution.But, so far as the objection was well founded infact, it was right to remove it by subsequent amendments; and congress have (as we shall see) accordinglyperformed the duty with most prompt and laudablediligence.§ 984. Let us now enter upon the considerationof the amendments, which, (it will be found,) principallyregard subjects properly belonging to a bill ofrights.^ 985. The first is " Congress shall make no lawrespecting an establishment of religion, or prohibitingthe free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedomof speech, or of the press ; or the right of the peoplepeaceably to assemble, and to petition government foraredress of grievances."^ 986. And first, the prohibition of any establishmentof religion, and the freedom of religious opinionand worship.How far any government has a right to interfere inmatters touching religion, has been a subject much discussedby writers upon public and political law. Theright and the duty of the interference of government,in matters of religion, have been maintained by manydistinguished authors, as well those, who were thewarmest advocates of free governments, as those,who were attached to governments of a more arbitrarycharacter. Indeed, the right of a society or governmentto interfere in matters of religion will hardlybe contested by any persons, who believe that piety,religion, and morality are intimately connected withCH. XLIV.] FREEDOM OF RELIGION. 699the well being of the state, and indispensable to theadministration of civil justice. The promulgation ofthe great doctrines of religion ; the being, and attributes,and providence of one Almighty God; theresponsibility to him for all our actions, founded uponmoral freedom and accountability ; a future state ofrewards and punishments ; the cultivation of all thepersonal, social, and benevolent virtues ; — thesenever can be a matter of indifference in any wellordered community. It is, indeed, difficult to conceive,how any civilized society can well exist withoutthem. And at all events, it is impossible forthose, who believe in the truth of Christianity, as adivine revelation, to doubt, that it is the especial dutyof government to foster, and encourage it among allthe citizens and subjects. This is a point wholly distinctfrom that of the right of private judgment inmatters of religion, and of the freedom of public worshipaccording to the dictates of one's own conscience.§ 987. The real difficulty lies in ascertaining thelimits, to which government may rightfully go in fosteringand encouraging religion. Three cases mayeasily be supposed. One, where a governmentaffords aid to a particular religion, leaving all personsfree to adopt any other ; another, where it createsan ecclesiastical establishment for the propagation ofthe doctrines of a particular sect of that religion, leavinga like freedom to all others ; and a third, where itcreates such an establishment, and excludes all persons,not belonging to it, either wholly, or in part, from anyparticipation in the public honours, trusts, emoluments,privileges, and immunities of the state. For instance,a government may simply declare, that the Christianreligion shall be the religion of the state, and shall be700 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.aided, and encouraged in all the varieties of sects belongingto it ; or it may declare, that the Catholic orProtestant religion shall be the religion of the state,leaving every man to the free enjoyment of his ownreligious opinions ; or it may establish the doctrines ofa particular sect, as of Episcopalians, as the religion ofthe state, with a like freedom ; or it may establish thedoctrines of a particular sect, as exclusively the religionof the state, tolerating others to a limited extent,or excluding all, not belonging to it, from allpublic honours, trusts, emoluments, privileges, andimmunities.^ 988. Probably at the time of the adoption of theconstitution, and of the amendment to it, now underconsideration, the general, if not the universal, sentimentin America was, that Christianity ought to receiveencouragement from the state, so far as it is notincompatible with the private rights of conscience,and the freedom of religious worship. An attempt tolevel all religions, and to make it a matter of statepolicy to hold all in utter indifference, would havecreated universal disapprobation, if not universal indignation.§ 989. It yet remains a problem to be solved inhumanaffairs, whether any free government can bepermanent, where the public worship of God, and thesupport of religion, constitute no part of the policy orduty of the state in any assignable shape. The futureexperience of Christendom, and chiefly of the Americanstates, must settle this problem, as yet new in the historyof the world, abundant, as it has been, in experimentsin the theory of government.§ 990. But the duty of supporting religion, andespecially the Christian religion, is very different fromCH. XLIV.] FREEDOM OF RELIGION. 701the right to force the consciences of other men, or topunish them for worshipping God in the manner, which,they believe, their accountability to him requires. Ithas been truly said, that "religion, or the duty weowe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it,can be dictated only by reason and conviction, not byforce or violence." Mr. Locke himself, who did notdoubt the right of government to interfere in matters ofreligion, and especially to encourage Christianity, hasat the same lime expressed his opinion of the right ofprivate judgment, and liberty of conscience, in a mannerbecoming his character, as a sincere friend of civiland religious liberty. " No man, or society of men,"says he, " have any authority to impose their opinionsor interpretations on any other, the meanest Christian ;since, in matters of religion, every man must know, andbelieve, and give an account for himself." The rightsof conscience are, indeed, beyond the just reach ofany human power. They are given by God, and cannotbe encroached upon by human authority, withouta criminal disobedience of the precepts of natural, aswell as of revealed religion.§ 991. The real object of the amendment was, notto countenance, much less to advance Mahometanism,or Judaism, or infidelity, by prostrating Christianity ;but to exclude all rivalry among Christian sects, andto prevent any national ecclesiastical establishment,which should give to an hierarchy the exclusive patronageof the national government. It thus sought tocut off the means of religious persecution, (the viceand pest of former ages,) and the power of subvertingthe rights of conscience in matters of religion, whichhad been trampled upon almost from the days of theApostles to the present age. The history of the CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.rent country had afforded the most solemn warningsand melancholy instructions on this head ; and evenNew-england, the land of the persecuted puritans, aswell as other colonies, where the Church of Englandhad maintained its superiority, had furnished achapter, as full of dark bigotry and intolerance, as any,which could be found to disgrace the pages of foreignannals. Apostacy, heresy, and nonconformity havebeen standard crimes for public appeals, to kindle theflames of persecution, and apologize for the mostatrocious triumphs over innocence and virtue.^ 992. It was under a solemn consciousness of thedangers from ecclesiastical ambition, the bigotry ofspiritual pride, and the intolerance of sects, thus exemplifiedin our domestic, as well as in foreign annals,that it was deemed advisable to exclude from thenational government all power to act upon the subject.The situation, too, of the different states equally proclaimedthe policy, as well as the necessity, of such anexclusion. In some of the states, episcopalians constitutedthe predominant sect; in others, presbyterians ;in others, congregationalists ; in others, quakers ; andin others again, there was a close numerical rivalryamong contending sects. It was impossible, that thereshould not arise perpetual strife and perpetual jealousyon the subject of ecclesiastical ascendancy, if the nationalgovernment were left free to create a religiousestablishment. The only security was in extirpatingthe power. But this alone would have been an imperfectsecurity, if it had not been followed up by a declarationof the right of the free exercise of religion, anda prohibition (as we have seen) of all religious tests.Thus, the whole power over the subject of religion isleft exclusively to the state governments, to be actedCH. XLIV.] FREEDOM OF RELIGION. 703upon according to their own sense of justice, and thestate constitutions ; and the Catholic and the Protestant,the Calvinist and the Arminian, the Jew and theInfidel, may sit down at the common table of the nationalcouncils, without any inquisition into their faith,or mode of worship.^ 993. The next clause of the amendment respectsthe liberty of the press. " Congress shall make nolaw abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press."That this amendment was intended to secure to everycitizen an absolute right to speak, or write, or print,whatever he might please, without any responsibility,public or private, therefor, is a supposition too wild tobe indulged by any rational man. This would be toallow to every citizen a right to destroy, at his pleasure,the reputation, the peace, the property, and eventhe personal safety of every other citizen. A manmight, out of mere mace and revenge, accuse anotherof the most infamous crimes ; might exciteagainst him the indignation of all his fellow citizensby the most atrocious calumnies ; might disturb, nay,overturn all his domestic peace, and embitter his parentalaffections ; might inflict the most distressingpunishments upon the weak, the timid, and the innocent; might prejudice all a man's civil, and political,and private rights ; and might stir up sedition, rebellion,and treason even against the government itself,in the wantonness of his passions, or the corruptionof his heart. Civil society could not go on undersuch circumstances. Men would then be obligedto resort to private vengeance, to make up for the deficienciesof the law ; and assassinations, and savagecruelties would be perpetrated with all the frequencybelonging to barbarous and brutal communities. It is704 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.plain, then, that the language of this amendment importsno more, than that every man shall have a rightto speak, write, and print his opinions upon any subjectwhatsoever, without any prior restraint, so always,that he does not injure any other person in his rights,person, property, or reputation; and so always, thathe does not thereby disturb the public peace, or attemptto subvert the government. It is neither more nor less,than an expansion of the great doctrine, recentlybrought into operation in the law of libel, that everyman shall be at liberty to publish what is true, withgood motives and for justifiable ends. And with thisreasonable Imitation it is not only right in itself, but it isan inestimable privilege in a free government. Withoutsuch a limitation, it might become the scourge of therepublic, first denouncing the principles of Liberty, andthen, by rendering the most virtuous patriots odiousthrough the terrors of the press, introducing despotismin its worst form.^ 994. A litde attention to the history of othercountries in other ages will teach us the vast importanceof this right. It is notorious, that, even to thisday, in some foreign countries it is a crime to speak uponany subject, religious, philosophical, or political, what iscontrary to the received opinions of the government,or the institutions of the country, however laudablemay be the design, and however virtuous may be themotive. Even to animadvert upon the conduct ofpublic men, of rulers, or representatives, in terms ofthe strictest truth and courtesy, has been, and is deemed,a scandal upon the supposed sanctity of their stationsand characters, subjecting the party to grievouspunishment. In some countries no works can be printedat all, whether/of science, or literature, or philosophy,CH. XLIV.] LIBERTY OF THE PRESS. 705without the previous approbation of the government ;and the press has been shackled, and compelled tospeak only in the timid language, which the cringingcourtier, or the capricious inquisitor, would license forpublication. The Bible itself, the common inheritance,not merely of Christendom, but of the world, has beenput exclusively under the control of government ; andnot allowed to be seen, or heard, except in a languageunknown to the common inhabitants of the country.To publish a translation in the vernacular tongue, hasbeen in former times a flagrant offence.§ 995. There is a good deal of loose reasoning onthe subject of the liberty of the press, as if its inviolabilitywere constitutionally such, that, like the king ofEngland, it could do no wrong, and was free from everyinquiry, and afforded a perfect sanctuary for everyabuse ; that, in short, it implied a despotic sovereigntyto do every sort of wrong, without the slightest accountabilityto private or public justice. Such a notionis too extravagant to be held by any sound constitutionallawyer, with regard to the rights and duties belongingto governments generally, or to the state governmentsin particular. If it were admitted to be correct,it might be justly affirmed, that the liberty of thepress is incompatible with the permanent existenceof any free government. Mr. Justice Blackstone hasremarked, that the liberty of the press, properly understood,is essential to the nature of a free state ; butthat this consists in laying no previous restraints uponpublications, and not in freedom from censure for criminalmatter, when published. Every freeman has anundoubted right to lay what sentiments he pleases beforethe public ; to forbid this is to destroy the freedomof the press. But, if he publishes what is improper,Abr. 89706 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.mischievous, or illegal, he must take the consequencesof his own temerity. To subject the press to therestrictive power of a licenser, as was formerly donebefore, and since the revolution (of 1688), is to subjectall freedom of sentiment to the prejudices of one man,and make him the arbitrary and infallible judge of allcontroverted points in learning, religion, and government.But to punish any dangerous or offensive writings,which, when published, shall, on a fair and impartialtrial, be adjudged of a pernicious tendency, is necessaryfor the preservation of peace and good order, ofgovernment and religion, the only solid foundations ofcivil liberty. Thus, the will of individuals is still leftfree ; the abuse only of that free will is the object oflegal punishment. Neither is any restraint hereby laidupon freedom of thought or inquiry ; liberty of privatesentiment is still left ; the disseminating, or makingpublic of bad sentiments, destructive of the ends ofsociety, is the crime, which society corrects. A manmay be allowed to keep poisons in his closet ; but notpublicly to vend them as cordials. And after someadditional reflections, he concludes with this memorablesentence : " So true will it be found, that to censurethe licentiousness, is to maintain the liberty of thepress."§ 996. The doctrine laid down by Mr. Justice Blackstone,respecting the liberty of the press, has not beenrepudiated (as far as is known) by any solemn decisionof any of the state courts, in respect to their own municipaljurisprudence. On the contrary, it has been repeatedlyaffirmed in several of the states, notwithstandingtheir constitutions, or laws recognize, that " the libertyof the press ought not to be restrained," or moreemphatically, that " the liberty of the press shall be inch.XLIV.] RIGHT OF PETITION. 707inviolably maintained." Nay ; it has farther been held,that the truth of the facts is not alone sufficient to justifythe publication, unless it is done from good motives,and for justifiable purposes, or, in other words, upon anoccasion, (as upon the canvass of candidates for publicoffice,) when public duty, or private right requires it.And Mr. Chancellor Kent, upon a large survey of thewhole subject, has not scrupled to declare, that " it hasbecome a constitutional principle in this country, thatevery citizen may freely speak, write, and publish hissentiments on all subjects, being responsible for theabuse of that right ; and, that no law can rightfullybe passed, to restrain, or abridge the freedom of thepress."§ 997. The remaining clause secures " the right ofthe people peaceably to assemble and to petition thegovernment for a redress of grievances."^ 998. This would seem unnecessary to be expresslyprovided for in a republican government, sinceit results from the very nature of its structure andinstitutions. It is impossible, that it could be practicallydenied, until the spirit of liberty had wholly disappeared,and the people had become so servile and debased,as to be unfit to exercise any of the privileges offreemen.§ 999. The provision was probably borrowed fromthe declaration of rights in England, on the revolutionof 1 688, in which the right to petition the king for aredress of grievances was insisted on ; and the right topetition parliament in the like manner has been providedfor, and guarded by statutes passed before, aswell as since that period. Mr. Tucker has indulgedhimself in a disparaging criticism upon the phraseologyof this clause, as savouring too much of that style of708 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.condescension, in which favours are supposed to begranted. But this seems to be quite overstrained;since it speaks the voice of the people in the languageof prohibition, and not in that of affirmance of a right,supposed to be unquestionable, and inherent.§ 1 000. The next amendment is : "A well regulatedmilitia being necessary to the security of a free state,the right of the people to keep and bear arms shallnot be infringed."§ 1001. The importance of this article will scarcelybe doubted by any persons, who have duly reflectedupon the subject. The militia is the natural defenceof a free country against sudden foreign invasions, domesticinsurrections, and domestic usurpations of powerby rulers. It is against sound policy for a free peopleto keep up large military establishments and standingarmies in time of peace, both from the enormous expenses,with which they are attended, and the facilemeans, which they afford to ambitious and unprincipledrulers, to subvert the government, or trample upon therights of the people. The right of the citizens to keep,and bear arms has justly been considered, as the palladiumof the liberties of a republic ; since it offers a strongmoral check against the usurpation and arbitrary powerof rulers ; and will generally, even if these are successfulin the first instance, enable the people to resist, andtriumph over them. And yet, though this truth wouldseem so clear, and the importance of a well regulatedmilitia would seem so undeniable, it cannot be disguised,that among the American people there is a growingindifference to any system of militia discipline, and astrong disposition, from a sense of its burthens, to berid of all regulations. How it is practicable to keep thepeople duly armed without some organization, it is diffi-CH. XLIV.] GENERAL WARRANTS. 709cult to see. There is certainly no small danger, thatindifference may lead to disgust, and disgust to contempt; and thus gradually undermine all the protectionintended by this clause of our national bill of rights.^ 1002. The next amendment is : "No soldier shallin time of peace be quartered in any house, withoutthe consent of the owner, nor in time of Vv^ar, but in amanner to be prescribed by law."§ 1003. This provision speaks for itself. Its plainobject is to secure the perfect enjoyment of that greatright of the common law, that a man's house shall behis own castle, privileged against all civil and militaryintrusion. The collecting of soldiers in time of peaceupon the people has been a common resort of arbitraryprinces, and is full of inconvenience and peril. In thepetition of right (4 Charles I), it was declared by parliamentto be a great grievance.§ 1004. The next amendment is : " The right of thepeople to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,"and effects against unreasonable searches and seizuresshall not be violated ; and no warrants shall issue,but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation,and particularly describing the place to besearched, and the person or things to be seized."^ 1005. This provision seems indispensable to the fullenjoyment of the rights of personal security, personalliberty, and private property. It is little more than theaffirmance of a great constitutional doctrine of the commonlaw. And its introduction into the amendmentswas doubtless occasioned by the strong sensibility excited,both in England and America, upon the subjectof general warrants almost upon the eve of the AmericanRevolution. Although special warrants upon complaintsunder oath, stating the crime, and the party by710 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [BOOK III.name, against whom the accusation is made, are theonly legal warrants, upon which an arrest can be madeaccording to the law of England ; yet a practice hadobtained in the secretaries' office ever since the restoration,(grounded on some clauses in the acts for regulatingthe press,) of issuing general warrants to take up,without naming any persons in particular, the authors,printers, and publishers of such obscene, or seditiouslibels, as were particularly specified in the warrant.When these acts expired, in 1 694, the same practicewas continued in every reign, and under every administration,except the last four years of Queen Anne'sreign, down to the year 1 763. The general warrants,so issued, in general terms authorized the officers toapprehend all persons suspected, without naming, ordescribing any person in special. In the year 1763,the legality of these general warrants was brought beforethe King's Bench for solemn decision ; and theywere adjudged to be illegal, and void for uncertainty.A warrant, and the complaint, on which the same isfounded, to be legal, must not only state the name ofthe party, but also the time, and place, and nature ofthe offence with reasonable certainty.^ 1006. The next amendment is : " Excessive bailshall not be required ; nor excessive fines imposed ;nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted." Thisis an exact transcript of a clause in the bill of rights,framed at the revolution of 1688. The provision wouldseem to be wholly unnecessary in a free government,since it is scarcely possible, that any department of sucha government should authorize, or justify such atrociousconduct. It was, however, adopted, as an admonitionto all departments of the national government, to warnthem against such violent proceedings, as had takenCH. XLIV.] Non-enumerated POWERS. 711place in England in the arbitrary reigns of some of theStuart. In those times a demand of excessive bail wasoften made against persons, who were odious to thecourt, and its favourites ; and on failing to procure it,they were committed to prison. Enormous fines andamercements were also sometimes imposed, and crueland vindictive punishments inflicted. Upon this subjectMr. Justice Blackstone has wisely remarked, thatsanguinary laws are a bad symptom of the distemper ofany state, or at least of its weak constitution. Thelaws of the Roman kings, and the twelve tables of theDecemvirs, were full of cruel punishments ; the Portionlaw, which exempted all citizens from sentence of death,silently abrogated them all. In this period the republicflourished. Under the emperors severe laws were revived,and then the empire fell.§ 1007. The next amendments : " The enumerationin the constitution of certain rights shall not be construedto deny, or disparage others retained by the"people." This clause was manifestly introduced toprevent any perverse, or ingenious misapplication of thewell known maxim, that an affirmation in particular casesimplies a negation in all others ; and e converso, thata negation in particular cases impMes an affirmation inall others. The maxim, rightly understood, is perfectlysound and safe ; but it has often been strangely forcedfrom its natural meaning into the support of the mostdangerous political heresies.§ 1008. The next and last amendment is: "Thepowers not delegated to the United States by the"constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reservedto the states respectively, or to the people."^ 1009. This amendment is a mere affirmation ofwhat, upon any just reasoning, is a necessary rule of712 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.interpreting the constitution. Being an instrument oflimited and enumerated powers, it follows irresistibly,that what is not conferred, is withheld, and belongs tothe state authorities, if invested by their constitutionsof government respectively in them ; and if not so invested,it is retained by the people, as a part of theirresiduary sovereignty. When this amendment wasbefore congress, a proposition was moved, to insert theword " expressly " before " delegated," so as to readthe powers not expressly delegated to the UnitedStates by the constitution," &.c. On that occasion itwas remarked, that it is impossible to confine a governmentto the exercise of express powers. There mustnecessarily be powers admitted by implication, unlessthe constitution should descend to the most minute details.It is a general principle, that all corporate bodiespossess all powers incident to a corporate capacity, withoutbeing absolutely expressed. The motion was accordinglynegatived. Indeed, one of the great defectsof the confederation was, (as we have already seen,)that it contained a clause, prohibiting the exercise ofany power, jurisdiction, or right, not expressly delegated.The consequence was, that congress were crippledat every step of their progress ; and were oftencompelled by the very necessities of the times to usurppowers, which they did not constitutionally possess ;and thus, in effect, to break down all the great barriersagainst tyranny and oppression.^ 1010. It is plain, therefore, that it could not havebeen the intention of the framers of this amendment togive it effect, as an abridgment of any of the powersgranted under the constitution, whether they are expressor implied, direct or incidental. Its sole designis to exclude any interpretation, by which other powersCH. XLIV.] POWERS NOT DELEGATED. 713should be assumed beyond those, which are granted.All that are granted in the original instrument, whetherexpress or implied, whether direct or incidental, areleft in their original state. All powers not delegated,(not, all powers not expressly delegated,) and notprohibited, are reserved. The attempts, then, whichhave been made from time to time, to force upon thislanguage an abridging, or restrictive influence, are utterlyunfounded in any just rules of interpreting thewords, or the sense of the instrument. Stripped of theingenious disguises, in which they are clothed, they areneither more nor less, than attempts to foist into thetext the word " expressly ; " to qualify, what is general,and obscure, what is clear, and defined. They makethe sense of the passage bend to the wishes and prejudicesof the interpreter ; and employ criticism to supporta theory, and not to guide it. One should suppose,if the history of the human mind did not furnish abundantproofs to the contrary, that no reasonable manwould contend for an interpretation founded neither inthe letter, nor in the spirit of an instrument. Where iscontroversy to end, if we desert both the letter and thespirit 1 What is to become of constitutions of government,if they are to rest, not upon the plain import oftheir words, but upon conjectural enlargements and restrictions,to suit the temporary passions and interestsof the day ? Let us never forget, that our constitutionsof government are solemn instruments, addressed tothe common sense of the people and designed to fix,and perpetuate their rights and their liberties. Theyare not to be frittered away to please the demagoguesof the day. They are not to be violated to gratify theambition of poUtical leaders. They are to speak in thesame voice now, and for ever. They are of no man'sAhr, 90714 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.private interpretation. They are ordained by the willof the people ; and can be changed only by the sovereigncommand of the people.^ 1011. It has been justly remarked, that the erectionof a new government, whatever care or wisdommay distinguish the work, cannot fail to originate questionsof intricacy and nicety ; and these may, in a particularmanner, be expected to flow from the establishmentof a constitution, founded upon the total, orpartial incorporation of a number of distinct sovereignties.Time alone can mature and perfect so compounda system ; liquidate the meaning of all the parts ; andadjust them to each other in a harmonious and consistentwhole.CH. XLV.] CONCLUDING CHAPTER. 715CHAPTER XLV.CONCLUDING REMARKS.^ 1012. We have now reviewed all the provisionsof the original constitution of the United States, and allthe amendments, which have been incorporated into it.And, here, the task originally proposed in these Commentariesis brought to a close. Many reflectionsnaturally crowd upon the mind at such a moment ;many grateful recollections of the past ; and many anxiousthoughts of the future. The past is secure. It isunalterable. The seal of eternity is upon it. The wisdom,which it has displayed, and the blessings, whichit has bestowed, cannot be obscured ; neither can theybe debased by human folly, or human infirmity. Thefuture is that, which may well awaken the most earnestsolicitude, both for the virtue and the permanence ofour republic. The fate of other republics, their rise,their progress, their decline, and their fall, are writtenbut too legibly on the pages of history, if indeed theywere not continually before us in the starting fragmentsof their ruins. They have perished ; and perished bytheir own hands. Prosperity has enervated them;corruption has debased them ; and a venal populacehas consummated their destruction. Alternately theprey of military chieftains at home, and of ambitiousinvaders from abroad, they have been sometimes cheatedout of their liberties by servile demagogues ; sometimesbetrayed into a surrender of them by false patriots; and sometimes they have willingly sold them for aprice to the despot, who has bidden highest for his CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.tims. They have disregarded the warning voice oftheir best statesmen ; and have persecuted, and drivenfrom office their truest friends. They have listened tothe fawning sycophant, and the base calumniator of thewise and the good. They have reverenced powermore in its high abuses and summary movements, thanin its calm and constitutional energy, when it dispensedblessings with an unseen, but liberal hand. They havesurrendered to faction, what belonged to the country.Patronage and party, the triumph of a leader, and thediscontents of a day, have outweighed all solid principlesand institutions of government. Such are themelancholy lessons of the past history of republics downto our own.^ 1013. It is not my design to detain the reader, byany elaborate reflections addressed to his judgment,either by way of admonition or of encouragement. Butit may not be wholly without use to glance at one ortwo considerations, upon which our meditations cannotbe too frequently indulged.^ 1014. In the first place, it cannot escape our notice,how exceedingly difficult it is to settle the foundationsof any government upon principles, which do notadmit of controversy or question. The very elements,out of which it is to be built, are susceptible of infinitemodifications ; and theory too often deludes us by theattractive simplicity of its plans, and imagination by thevisionary perfection of its speculations. In theory, agovernment may promise the most perfect harmony ofoperations in all its various combinations. In practice,the whole machinery may be perpetually retarded, or,thrown out of order by accidental mal-adjustments. Intheory, a government may seem deficient in unity ofdesign and symmetry of parts ; and yet, in practice, itCH. XL v.] CONCLUDING CHAPTER. 717may work with astonishing accuracy and force for thegeneral welfare. Whatever, then, has been found towork well in experience, should be rarely hazardedupon conjectural improvements. Time, and long andsteady operation are indispensable to the perfection ofall social institutions. To be of any value they mustbecome cemented with the habits, the feelings, and thepursuits of the people. Every change discomposes forawhile the whole arrangements of the system. Whatis safe is not always expedient ; what is new is oftenpregnant with unforeseen evils, and imaginary good.^ 1015. In the next place, the slightest attention tothe history of the national constitution must satisfyevery reflecting mind, how many difficulties attendedits formation and adoption, from real or imaginary differencesof interests, sectional feelings, and local institutions.It is an attempt to create a national sovereignty,and yet to preserve the state sovereignties ; though itis impossible to assign definite boundaries in all casesto the powers of each. The influence of the disturbingcauses, which, more than once in the convention, wereon the point of breaking up the Union, have since immeasurablyincreased in concentration and vigour. Thevery inequalities of a government, confessedly foundedin a compromise, were then felt with a strong sensibility; and every new source of discontent, whether accidentalor permanent, has since added increased activityto the painful sense of these inequalities. The Northcannot but perceive, that it has yielded to the South asuperiority of representatives, already amounting totwenty-five, beyond its due proportion ; and the Southimagines, that, with all this preponderance in representation,the other parts of the Union enjoy a more perfectprotection of their interests, than its own. The718 CONSTITUTION OF THE U. STATES. [bOOK III.West feels its growing power and weight in theUnion ; and the Atlantic states begin to learn, that thesceptre must one day depart from them. If, under thesecircumstances, the Union should once be broken up, itis impossible, that a new constitution should ever beformed, embracing the whole Territory. We shall bedivided into several nations or confederacies, rivals inpower and interest, too proud to brook injury, and tooclose to make retaliation distant or ineffectual. Ourvery animosities will, like those of all other kindred nations,become more deadly, because our lineage, laws,and language are the same. Let the history of the Grecianand Italian republics warn us of our dangers. Thenational consdtunon is our last, and our only security.United we stand ; divided we fall.^ 1016. If these Commentaries shall but inspire therising generation with a more ardent love of their country,an unquenchable thirst for liberty, and a profoundreverence for the consdtution and the Union, then theywill have accomplished all, that their author ought todesire. Let the American youth never forget, thatthey possess a noble inheritance, bought by the toils,and sufferings, and blood of their ancestors ; and capable,if wisely improved, and faithfully guarded, of transmittingto their latest posterity all the substantial blessingsof life, the peaceful enjoyment of liberty, property,religion, and independence. The structure has beenerected by architects of consummate skill and fidelity ;its foundations are solid ; its compartments are beautiful,as well as useful ; its arrangements are full of wisdomand order ; and its defences are impregnable fromwithout. It has been reared for immortality, if thework of man may justly aspire to such a tide. Itmay, nevertheless, perish in an hour by the folly, orCH.
