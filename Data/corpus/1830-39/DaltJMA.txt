Togetherthey extend over a surface of about fifty Irish milesin length by thirty-six in the greatest breadth, comprisingthe whole of the County of Dublin, the mostof Wicklow, a great part of Kildare, and portions ofthe Queen s County and Wexford, an estimated areaof 477,950A., of which 142,050A. are in the Countyof Dublin, 257,400A. in Wicklow, 75,OOOA. in Kildare,600A. in the Queen s County, and 2,900A. inWexford. The agreeable quantity of church landsbelonging to the united sees, and lying within theabove scope, has been returned in 1831 as 23,926 A.profitable, and 7,1 OOA. unprofitable, let at 3,202per annum and 4,257 annual renewal fines. Whilea return of 1833 states the respective number andvalue of the benefices in both sees as, forty worthMEMOIRS OFfrom 30 to 200 per annum ; twelve from 200 to250 ; eight from 250 to 300 ; seven from 300to 350; eight from 350 to 400; four from400 to 450 ; six from 450 to 500 ; nine from500 to 550; four from 550 to 600; twofrom 600 to 650 ; four from 650 to 700 ; threefrom 700 to 750; four from 750 to 1000;two from 1100 to 1200; and one from 1300 to1350 per annum. The gross income of those 114benefices being calculated as 24,363 18s. 6d. 9 exclusiveof the values of thirty-eight other beneficesnot returned in the estimate. The patronage of thewhole may be thus classified. The Crown presentsto fourteen ; the Lord Chancellor, the Master of theRolls, and the three Chief Judges, in conjunctionwith bis Grace the Archbishop, to two ; the chapterof Christ Church, or its members separately, to ten ;lay patrons to eighteen, and the Archbishop to theremainder.The union of the bishoprics, alluded to, took place inthe year 1214, and still subsists ; both having beenthereupon divided into ten deaneries, severally styled ;1. Decanatus Christianitatis, Dublin; 2. Taney ;3. Swords ; 4. Ballymore ; 5. Bray ; 6. Wicklow ; 7-Arklow ; 8. Castledermot ; 9. Athy ; and 10. DeSalt Salmon. The number has been since increasedto twelve, the names of which stand thus inthe Consistorial Registry of this diocese, viz. 1. Deanatus Christianitatis, Dublin ; 2. Swords ; 3. Lusk ;4. Finglas ; 5. Newcastle ; 6. Taney ; 7. De SaltSalmon, alias Leixlip ; 8. Bray ; 9. Wicklow ; 10.THE ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN. 3Arklow ; 11. Ballymore ; and 12. Murphy ; whichlast denomination includes the two more ancientdeaneries of Castledermot and Athy.The dignitary, who presided over this most importantprovince of Ireland, was not only ancientlyhonoured with a seat in the King s Privy Council inEngland, where he used to attend his Majesty inmany weighty consultations, as shewn hereafter, buthad also within his liberties of the Cross,* or his ownchurch-lands, the rights of a prince palatine, with thepower of even condemning to death criminals offendingtherein, for whose execution a gallows was erectedat Harold s Cross. It is, perhaps, needless to remark,that this extremity of jurisdiction is now altogetherdisused ; his seneschal, however, still holds a courtfor other purposes of the archiepiscopal authority, inahandsome structure erected in Upper Bride-street,adjoining to which is the gaol for confining debtorswithin his liberties. This officer is usually a barrister,selected by the prelate s appointment, as confirmedby the respective deans and chapters of ChristChurch and St. Patrick s, and the individual so namedchooses his own register, who is always an attorneyof the superior courts. The Archbishop also holdsa Consistorial Court at the King s Inns, and, besideshis other extensive franchises, the regulation of thepolice in the manor or liberty of St. Sepulchre was,until modern enactments, vested in his officers, as fullyas it existed in the city magistrates for the libertySoc "History of the County of Dublin at "Swords" in 1465.B24 MEMOIRS OFof the city ; he has, likewise, the right of a marketin Patrick-street.There are in the diocese of Dublin two cathedrals,a peculiarity in which Saragossa alone participates.Both of those are situated within the cityand liberties of Dublin, viz. Christ Church and St.Patrick s, of which it is only necessary here to remark,that the former was built about the year 1038, andthat its chapter consists of the dean, precentor, chancellor,treasurer, the archdeacon of Dublin, and threeprebendaries, besides two clerical and seven lay vicars-choral; while the latter was built about the year1190, on the site of an old parochial church whichwas said to have been erected by St. Patrick. Itschapter is constituted of a dean, precentor, chancellor,treasurer, the archdeacons of Dublin and Glendaleand twenty prebendaries, the prebend of Cullenbeing united to the archbishopric. There are also inthis establishment four minor canons, four clericaland seven lay vicars-choral.

Mr. Mason,however, in his invaluable history of the former edifice,successfully combats this opinion, and provesthat both belonged to Dublin ;* in accordance withwhich conclusion, it is to be observed, that, beforeSt. Patrick s cathedral was built, or the union of thesees contemplated, the church, on whose site it waserected, was (in 1179) in Pope Alexander s Bull describedas one of the parishes and within the dioceseof Dublin ; while a contemporaneous Bull of the samePope mentions the cathedral of Glendalough as beingin the little city of that name, where its ruins are stillidentified.In 1214, as before mentioned, the two sees wereunited, for the reasons explicitly declared in the Testimonialof Felix O Ruadan, Archbishop of Team,and of his suffragans to whom the Pope had occasionto refer the subject. The original of this curious ecclesiasticalinstrument is still extant in the archives ofChrist Church, and has the archbishop s seal pendantto it, but those of his suffragans have crumbled away.It is neither dated nor witnessed, but appears evidentlyfrom its contents to have been drawn up inthe year 1214, immediately upon the death of WilliamPiro the last recognised Bishop of Glendalough,and refers to those grants and documents hereinafterSee Mason s Hist. St. Patrick s Cathedral, p. 4,THE ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN. /more particularly noticed in the order of their respectivedates. The document is in the following words:A letter concerning the Palls sent into Ireland.The testimony of the Archbishop of Tuam and hissuffragans : Master John Paparo, legate of the RomanSee, coming into Ireland, found a bishop dwelling atDublin, who then exercised episcopal offices withinthe walls. He found in the same diocese anotherchurch (ecclesiae) in the mountainous parts, whichwas also called a city, and had a certain rural bishop(chorepiscopum), but the same legate appointed Dublin,which was the best city, the metropolis of thatprovince, delivering the pall to that bishop who thengoverned the church of Dublin ; and he appointedthat that diocese, in which both cities were, should bedivided, the one part thereof to fall to the metropolis,the other to remain to him who lived in the mountains,with the intention (as we firmly believe), thatthat part also should revert to the metropolis, on thedeath of the bishop who then governed in the mountains.Which object he would have immediatelyeffected, had not the insolence of the Irishryry, whothen had power in that territory, obstructed him.When the Lord Henry, King of England, learnedfrom many what had been the intention of the saidlegate, he granted the church in the mountains to themetropolis, adhering to the intention and will of , thesaid legate. In like manner our present Lord John,King of England, having heard from the great andcredible men of that territory, what the said legatedid and intended, granted the said part to John theMEMOIRS OFpredecessor of the present Archbishop of Dublin.Besides, that holy church in the mountains, althoughanciently held in great veneration on account of St.Kevin, who there led an eremite life, has been sodeserted and desolate for the last forty years, thatinstead of a church it is a cave of robbers, and a hotbedof thieves, so that more homicides are committedin that valley than in any other part of Ireland, onaccount of its deserted and extensive solitude. *Accordingly a Bull of Pope Innocent the Third,dated the 25th of February, 1215, details the particularsof the above testimonial, and ratifies theunion; white another Bull of the same Pontiff of the18th of May, 1216, enumerating and confirming thesuffragan sees of the province of Dublin, omits Glen-clough,as then merged in it ; and a Bull of PopeHonor i us the Third further enforces the acts of hispredecessor in this matter.Immediately after this event, the chapter of St.Patrick s, having asserted that that of Glendalotigh wasthereby abolished, transmitted a petition to the Courtof Rome relative to the difference which arose thereoutbetween them and R. de Bedford, then Dean of Glen-clough,and afterwards Bishop of Lismore. The subjectwas thereupon referred by the Pope to the saidFelix O Ruadan, Archbishop of Tuam, whose decree infavour of the chapter of Glendalough was confirmedby Pope Honorius in the first year of his pontificate,*from which time both chapters, although distinct cor-allens Registry.THE ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN. 9portions, became canonically united, and possessedof equal power and interest in all matters that concernedthe diocese.It would be now extremely difficult to define theprecise limits of the respective bishoprics, as they existedimmediately previous to the time of their union.From a consideration, however, of two Bulls of PopeAlexander the Third, both dated in 1179? and extantin the Crede Mihi, and of certain grants of JohnEarl of Moreton, hereafter mentioned, the boundaryof the see of Dublin may be defined, as having includedDalkey and its island, Kiltuc (near Drunken),Carmichael, Kilgobbin, half Taney, Rathfarnham,Kilnasantan (St. Anne s church), Tallagh, Clondal-kin, Rathcoole, and by Aldergg, c. ; while the parallelof Glendalough comprised Sandhill, Stagonil, halfTaney, Newcastle, Lyons, by Aldergg, Coffee, Lara-brien, Tachdoe, Stacumney, &c. Kilcullcn was indisputablyin Glendalough diocese, Aldergg was somuch on the confines, that an inquisition was necessitatedin 1329 to determine to which see it appertained,when, it being proved that it paid half a markproxies to the Archdeacon of Dublin, the jury gavetheir verdict accordingly in favour of that diocese.Such having been the extent of Dublin as a diocese,it is to be observed, that as an ecclesiasticalprovince it comprehended, with the sees of Dublinand Glendalough, those of Kildare, Ossory, Ferns,and Leighlin, all being included within the civil provinceof Leinster. Under the Church TemporalitiesAct, however, the Bishopric of Kildare is, on its next10 MEMOIRS OFvacancy, to be permanently united with those ofDublin and Glendalough ; and, in like manner, theBishopric of Ossory is on vacancy to be permanentlyunited with those of Ferns and Leighlin. The actalso provides, that, on the next avoidance of the seeof Cashel, that province is to be reduced to the rankof a bishopric, and, together with all its dependantsees, is to be suffragan to the Archbishop of Dublin,whose jurisdiction will then extend over the whole ofMunster, the greater part of Leinster, and a certainportion of Galway in Connaught.Having premised thus much in relation to thestatistics of the diocese, the records of its history nextinvite attention, and, although it would be difficult toattain any positive evidence that Dublin was the seatof a bishop s jurisdiction so early as the time of St.Patrick, yet, as he founded a church there about theyear 456, it may be reasonably inferred, that he did notin that particular instance deviate from the practice ofEpiscopal Church Government, which he introducedin other parts of the island.Christianity, it may be here necessary to observe,had made some progress in Ireland before his mission.*Tertullian in the first century mentions,that parts of the British Islands, which had neverbeen approached by the Romans, were subjected totrue Christianity, Britain and Ireland being both de-seevery fully on this subject, a prize "Essay" written by theauthor of this work, and published in the Royal Irish Academy Transactions,vol. xvi. part 1., from which the above is chiefly extracted,and where the authorities are given.THE ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN. 1 Inominated by the Romans British Islands, and soBaronies construes the passage. Eusebius more thanconfirms Tertullian, for he asserts that some of theapostles had proceeded beyond the ocean to theislands called British, in which he is followed byNicephorus, who, in his account of the dispersion ofthe apostles, says, that one chose Egypt and Libya,while another was appointed for the remote islands ofthe ocean, and for the British Isles. Vincent's ofBeauvais particularizes James the son of Zebedee ashaving preached in Ireland, and selected seven disciplesthere with whom he went to Jerusalem, wherehe suffered martyrdom ; to which Julian of Toledo,in his Chronicle, adds, that not only was St. Jamesin Ireland, but that he addressed thence a canonicalletter to the Jews who were scattered through Spain.The Irish annals further suggest this early introductionof the faith, when they allege, that in themiddle of the third century Cormac King of Irelandcarried on a theological discussion with its heathenpriesthood so earnestly, that his sudden death is attributedto their provoked resentment. St. Chrysostomin the fourth century asserts, that the inhabitants ofthe British Islands not only believed in Christ, buterected churches and altars of sacrifice to God.Rupert states, that in 350 Elephius, the son of aScots-Hibernian King, suffered martyrdom, havingbeen decapitated by the Emperor Julian, who waspresent at the execution ; and Gennadius records,that subsequently Celestius, when a very youth, wrote,from the monastery where he sojourned, three letters12 MEMOIRS OFin the manner of little books to his parents in Ireland,which writings, he adds, are necessary to every onewho has the love of God. This very Celestius,however, afterwards became the great disciple ofPelagius and the advocate of his heresy, in consequenceof which he was in the year 412 condemnedin the synod of Carthage ; St. Jerome, in the mostobvious interpretation of his words, says, that Celestiuswas an Irishman, but some refer the words, accordingto the only other sense in which they can be understood,to Pelagius himself.*Prosper expressly writes, that St. Patrick wassent from Rome the first Bishop to those of theScots (the Irish were then exclusively so called) thatbelieved in Christ ; while Bede affirms, that it wasnot the custom of the Church of Rome to ordain abishop for any nation, before Christianity had establishedsome roots there ; and accordingly varioussaints are actually enumerated as of Ireland beforeSt. Patrick, or Palladius who immediately precededhim. It has, however, been urged, in evidence ofthe paucity of this Christian congregation, thatPalladius, when he was leaving this country in despair,considered two monks and three churches sufficient" for the spiritual service of the scanty conversesYet it should be considered that Palladiuswas scarcely one year in the country, and that hisministry was exercised but very partially : St. PatrickSee St. Jerome, Pro. ad L. 3.

Theirlabours and pious exercises were the faint twilightof the Christian revelation, that first broke uponIreland, and but foretokened the coming of him, whowas happily to fulfil the alleged prediction of theMagian prophets,* and whom all tradition and biographymark as the apostle of universal Ireland.It is not necessary here to enter into the controversies,that some Hardouins have sought to raiseagainst the voice of history, in reference to the birthplace,the era, and even the existence of this Irishmissionary. If the two last points of scepticismwere as innocent as the first, they should never havebeen noticed ; all have, however, been discussed inthe "Essay" before alluded to, to which it may heresuffice to refer. The results of his preaching areyet more evident ; it threw a sudden charm over theisland; the inquiring nocked to him from everyquarter, and went back to their families, convertsand proselytes ; episcopal jurisdictions were markedout, and prelates and clergymen were appointed, innumbers sufficient for the labours of religious controversyand spiritual direction. Ecclesiastical schoolswere every where established ; the country was filled" A perverse and obstinate prophet shall come from parts beyondthe sea, to preach a new doctrine, to whom many will lend their attention,and few resist his progress." Coggan. Trias Thrum. p. 123.14 MEMOIRS OFwith bishops, priests, and religious houses ; the monksdispersed themselves over every district, and no placewas more justly celebrated for the sanctity and learningof its several monastic fraternities. The retreats,which they selected, they cleared and cultivated withtheir own hands ; they fasted and prayed without intermission,instructing even more by their examplethan their precept, until the country of their missionwas hallowed by the glorious appellation the Islandof Saints.It has been remarked, that this " quick and easyreception of Christianity in Ireland, is an unequivocalproof, not only of the liberal and tolerating spirit ofthe religion it supplanted, but also of enlightenedcivilization and charitable forbearance, certainly withoutparallel in the early records of the Christianworld." The glorious result must also bear eloquenttestimony to the mild and conciliating manners ofthe new priesthood, the chanties with which theyinsinuated their doctrine into the heart of the country,founding their seminaries where the Magi (as thepagan priesthood of Ireland were properly denominated)had taught, enclosing their carols in thegroves of the ancient rites, carving the symbol ofChristianity on the pillar stones of heathenism ; consecrating,as stations for prayer, those wells which hadbeen invested with immemorial superstitions, kindlingthe bel-tonne for purposes of innocent diversion,perpetuating the sacred fire on the altar of the MostHigh, and above all, constructing the simple modelsof their churches in the shadow of the round towers ;THE ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN. 15thus, in every scene and object, imperceptibly succeeding*to the veneration and authority of theirpagan predecessors.They were, however, not the less firm wherefirmness was essential. They diligently expoundedthe scriptures to the people ;* the enemy were metin controversy at their strongest holds ; and piles ofheathen learning, the spoils of victory, were consignedto destruction. St. Patrick sanctioned the policyof this desolation, and is said to have destroyed withhis own hand two hundred volumes of the writingsof the " Magi." His successors, no less zealous in thecause of truth, well merited those praises whichCamden so liberally bestowed upon them. Enlargingtheir schools, multiplying their churches, fixingthemselves as beacons of salvation in the wildest districts,and every where edifying by their example,they attracted around them the young and the old,while the converts gladly flocked to their habitationsfor more frequent spiritual assistance, until littletowns were associated, and monasteries and collegesincorporated. Paganism could not long withstand thepowerful and exemplary superiority of such teachers ;like a mist before the rising day, it passed off fromthe broad face of the country, and only hung inthick but partial cloudiness over the deeper valleysand remoter islands of the west, or the kindredmountains of Caledonia.

In strictreference, therefore, to the hierarchy of the selecteddistrict, although, as before suggested, the materialsfor any history of the prelates of Dublin, from thefoundation of its church by St. Patrick, down to thetime of Bishop Donatus the Dane, are slender anddoubtful, yet are there some afforded, at least fromthe middle of the seventh century, which it wouldbe unjustifiable to suppress.Livings.[Ob. 656.]Livinus is mentioned as " Bishop of Dublin" inthe Office Propria, &c., of Burke, who adds, that heLI YIN US. 17succeeded his uncle Melanchus in this see. That hewas a native of Ireland, and received his educationthere, all authorities, Bale, Molanus, Mabillon, Fleury,&c., admit, and Piraeus says, he was the son of personsof distinction in that country. It is likewiseagreed by all, that he was an Irish bishop, and hisown poetical epistle to the Abbot Florbert, as givenin Ussher, Exist. Hib. Syll. N. 8, confirms this;Masses and others state, that, actuated by religiouszeal, having entrusted his diocese in Ireland to themanagement of its archdeacon, he passed over toGhent with three of his disciples, continued therefora month, during which he every day offered upthe mass at the tomb of St. Bavo, and afterwardswent to Esca, where he preached the gospel andconverted numbers, until he was murdered by someof its pagan inhabitants on the twelfth of Novemberin the year 656. He was buried at Hautam, whencehis remains were translated in 1006 to the greatmonastery of St. Peter s at Ghent, and ultimatelydeposited in the Cathedral of St. Bavo, on the festivalof Saints Peter and Paul in the same year.In the poetical epistle of Livinus, above alludedto, occur several passages, that do honour to theclassical taste of the Irish schools of that period.Adeo mira loqui, solem sine luniine vidi ;Est sine luce dies, sic sine pace quies ;Hos postquam populos conspexi luce serena,Sol mihi non luxit, nox fuit una mihi.Impia barbaric gens exagitata tumultHie Brabant fuit, neque cruelty petit ;C18 BISHOPS OF DUBLIN.Quid tibi peccavi, qui pacis nuntia porto,Pax est quod porto, cur mihi bella moves ?********Egress patria pompae mortals honoresSprevi, devovi, spes Deus una mihi ;" &c. &c.An epitaph on St. Bavo by him is also extant,equally creditable to his taste and literary acquirements.It is published by Usher and Mabillon,(Sec. ii. Ben. p. 461,) and read in the old office ofSt. Bavo at Ghent, published by Gerard Salenson.Mabillon gives a life of Livinus, written by an ecclesiastic,named Boniface. See also Bale, Sanders,Colgan, &c. for further particulars of this prelate ;while, in affirmance of the accredited tradition thathe should be ranked as here, it is to be observed thatthe decree of Pope Benedict the Fourteenth, datedon the 1st of July, 1747? granted at the solicitation ofthe clergy of Ireland, and confirming the offices andmasses of the saints of their nation, expressly stylesSt. Livinus Bishop of Dublin and Martyr, and statesthe 12th of November as the anniversary of his commemoration.*ST.

Wire. 19and learning ; and with such success, that he was, atan early period of his life, elected Bishop of Dublin ;and, although greatly reluctant to assume its responsibilities,was compelled by the people to take upon himthat high charge. He accordingly went to Rome toreceive consecration from the Pope. Plechelmus, apriest, accompanied him in his journey, and was consecratedwith him at Rome, whence Wiro, returningto Ireland, was received in that country with extraordinaryjoy. He governed this see for some time, andobtained a high reputation on account of his sanctity,but at last resigned his bishopric and went to Gaul,where he was honourably received by Duke Pepin deHeristall, " the mighty ruler and father of kings,"who chose him for his confessor, and assigned to hima place proper for retirement and contemplation,called Mons Petri, in the diocese of Liege, HereSt. Wiro built an oratory, which he dedicated to theBlessed Virgin, and called it St. Peter s monastery.After attaining a great age, he at last died of a fever onthe 8th of May, on which day his festival is observed,but the precise year of his death is very uncertain ;that assigned by Harris is evidently as erroneous asthe period to which he refers the martyrdom of Livings.He was buried in the oratory which he haderected ; but, in consequence of its collegiate churchhaving been transferred to Ruremond, a portion ofthe saint s remains was removed thither, while anotherwas reverentially exhibited at Utrecht.

In the thirtieth year ofhis age he was ordained a priest, and some time afterwardselected bishop. When he had governed hissee ten years he was driven from it by the insolenceof the people, and at length compelled to resign itin 675, or 674 according to Marinus Scotus. Hethereupon forsook Ireland, and, associating himselfwith three learned and religious men, viz. Giraldus,Clement, and Salus, travelled into Germany, movingabout from place to place, and preaching the Gospelfor ten years. At last he arrived at a high woodymountain, which the owner of the country conferredupon him, and there he settled and lived an emeticlife. He drew to him many of the religious of theorder of St. Benedict, and founded a monastery onthis mountain, which, from his name, was called, asArnold Lion says, Mount-Disibod, since changedinto Dissenters, in the lower Palatinate. He livedthirty years here in exercises of great severity, anddied, worn out with extreme old age, on the 8th ofJuly, but the precise year is not ascertained.Hildigardis, a nun, who was educated at Dissentberg under the Abbess Justa, wrote his life, whichST. RUMOLD. 21Surius has published, and whence most of the particularshere related have been taken. John Wilson,in his Martyr ol. Anglice., at the 8th of July, speaksof him as Bishop of Dublin ; but Harris, while headopts the assertion on Wilson s credit, states it asunsupported by the authorities cited by that writer.Dempster affirms, that he saw a fragment of Disibod scomposition, entitled, " De Monachorum protect insolitude gentium Liber 1."*GUALAFER.Gualafer is mentioned as Bishop of Dublin byMolanus, but no particulars are related of him, exceptthat he baptized his successor St. Rumoltl.ST. RUMOLD.[Ob. 775.]The life of St. Ilumold, Bishop of Dublin, publishedby Surius, was written by Theodoric, Abbot ofSt. Truro, and recited on his festival ; whence, aswell as from Molanus and several martyrologiesand breviaries, Harris gives the following account ofhim : " He was the son of David, a prince in Ireland,(which was then divided into many petty territories,)and was heir to his father. He was baptizedby his predecessor Gualafer, then Bishop of Dublin,by whom, being well grounded in learning and virtue,Ware s Bishops, p. 304.22 BISHOPS OF DUBLIN.he forsook his pretensions to his inheritance for thesake of religion, and took a journey to Rome ; but,before this, is said to have been consecrated Bishop ofDublin. He first passed into Britain, then intoGaul ; and wherever he went preached Christ and hisGospel. He travelled over the Alps and arrived atRome, where he received from the Pope an approbationof his labours. Having continued some time inRome, he repassed into Gaul and came to Mechlin,where Do, or Ado, a count of the place, togetherwith his wife, received him with great humanity, andprevailed on him to settle there. He gave him aplace called Ulmus, from the numerous elm treesgrowing there, where he founded a monastery ; andMechlin being erected into an episcopal see, he becameits first bishop. At length two ruffians (the onethinking he had money, the other, out of a motive ofrevenge, because Rumold had reprimanded him forliving in a scandalous state,) fell upon him, and cruellymurdered him on the 24th of June, 775 ; and, toconceal their villany, threw his body into a river.Count Ado had it removed thence, and gave it anhonourable interment in St. Stephen s church. Hisremains were afterwards translated to a church inMechlin, dedicated to his memory, which is now themetropolitan church of the Low Countries, and oneof the largest Gothic structures in it ; there they areconserved in a sumptuous silver shrine. Pope Alexanderthe Fourth transferred the day of the observationof St. Rumold s festival to the 3rd of July, becausethe 24th of June, on which he was murdered,ST. RUMOLD. 23was pre-occupied as the festival of St. John the Baptist.The feast of St. Rumokl is celebrated as a doublefestival, with an office of nine lessons, through all theprovince of Mechlin ;"* and is also observed on thatday in Ireland, although Pope Benedict the Fourteenthwould have further altered the festival to the1st of July.Tanning, the Botanist, represents St. Rumokl asan Anglo-saxon, and gives a long history of the miracleswhich he effected. But the fullest particulars ofthis prelate are contained in his " Acts," c. by HughWard, who, however, styles him " Arch-Bishop" ofDublin, and affects to detail other circumstancesequally erroneous and fanciful. There is likewise avery large and interesting folio work of his Acts, collectedby John Baptist Sollcr, the Jesuit, published atAntwerp in 1/18, and illustrated with some curiouswood-cuts ; amongst which is one of a silver shrine,overlaid with gold, which was constructed in 1369 forthe bones of this revered patron of Mechlin, at an expenseof 60,000 florins. This precious article was, inthe wars of 1580, broken up and sold ; but the boneswere subsequently collected, and a new shrine framed in1617 at about one-third of the cost of the former, andon a far more elegant design, as it is to this day exhibitedin the cathedral. Of this also the book alludedto gives a drawing.Ware s Bishops, (Harris s Edition,) pp. 304-5.24 BISHOPS OF DUBLIN.Sedulous.[Ob. 785.]Sedulius, in Irish Siedhiul, the son of Luaith, i scalled Bishop of Dublin in the martyrologies of MarianGerman and those of Tallagh. In the Annalsof the Four Masters he is styled Abbot of Dublin,bishop and abbot being often used as synonymousterms ; and the offices of both, though in their natureperfectly distinct, having been often vested in thesame person. Sedulius died on the 12th of February,in the year 785.Burke, in Inv office of St. Rumoldus, states, thatwhen that holy man resigned the see of Dublin, PopeStephen the Third conferred it on Sedulius ; and evenLanigan, who maintains that there were no Bishops ofDublin previous to Donatus, expresses much doubtas to excluding this individual from the honour.CORMAC,[Vivens, 890,]of whom Harris says, he " could find no account buthis bare name," flourished about the year soo. WhenGregory, King of Scotland, besieged Dublin in thatyear, and reduced its inhabitants to the utmost straitsfor want of provisions, " in the end it was concludedamongst them, that sith there was no means for thosenoble men, which were enclosed within that city, toescape the enemy s hands, and that there were noneother of any reputation abroad able to defend theCOHMAC. 25country from the Scotchman s puissance, they shouldfall to some treaty with the Scottish king for a peace,to be had with so reasonable conditions as might beobtained, for other remedy in that present mischiefthey might devise none; and therefore this was judgedthe best way of the whole number, namely Cormac,Bishop of Dublin, a man for his singular virtue andreputation, of upright life, of no small authorityamongst them, took upon him to go unto Gregory tobreak the matter, and so coming afore his presence,besought him most humbly to have compassion uponthe poor miserable city ; and, if he had conceived anypiece of displeasure against the citizens, that it mightplease him yet, upon their humble submission, to receivethem unto his mercy, and further to accept intohis protection his cousin, young Duncan, (Enough,)unto whom the kingdom of Ireland was due of right,as all the world well understood"*Gregory refused, however, to extend any hope,until the city was absolutely surrendered to his discretion,which being done, "he commanded his battleto stay a little, and therewith himself advanced forthon foot, till he came to the bishop, and, falling downupon his knees, he reverently kissed the crucifix whichthe prelate bore, and fully ratified his wishes ; whereupon,receiving humble thanks, with high commendationof the bishop for such his clemency, he enteredthe city, not staying till he came into the marketplace,where, commanding one part of his army tokeep their standing, he went with the residue into theHolinshed s Hist, of Scotland.

Part ofan epistolatory correspondence between this prelateand Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, is yet extant; the former having transmitted to the latter somewritten inquiries relative to baptism and the holycommunion, and received a reply in reference theretoThat it was expedient that all people, living anddying, should be fortified with the body and blood ofthe Lord ; but, if it should happen that a person baptizedshould die before he received the body and bloodof Christ, God forbid that he should perish eternally ;"fand he cites several passages of Scripture to prove thisposition ; while, in reference to baptism, Lanfrancinculcates, "That, if an infant not baptized, (so he beHolinshed s Hist, of Scotland.

Sylloge, p. 73, &c.9 g BISHOPS OF DUBLIN.styled in the Annals of the Four Masters, Gills Patricians,was, at the instance of Gotred, elected bythe people of Dublin to succeed in this see, and wassent into England to receive consecration from Lanfranc,Archbishop of Canterbury, bearing with him thefollowing recommendatory epistle: " To Lanfranc,the venerable metropolitan of the Holy Church ofCanterbury, the clergy and people of Dublin tendertheir bounden obedience. It is known unto yourfatherhood, that the church of Dublin, the metropolisof Ireland, is bereft of her pastor and destituteof her ruler. Wherefore we have elected apriest called Patrick, a person whom we thoroughlyknow ; one noble both by birth and morals, wellimbued in apostolical and ecclesiastical discipline, infaith a Catholic, in the interpretation of the Scriptureswary, in the tenets of the church well versed,and whom we desire, without delay, to be ordainedour bishop; that, under God, he may rule overus orderly, and profit us, and that we, under hisgovernment, may exercise a spiritual warfare, withsecurity. Because the integrity of the ruler is thesafety of the subject; and, where safety of obedienceis, there is the sound form of doctrine." The copyof this epistle is preserved in an ancient book, inthe Cotton Library, which formerly belonged to thechurch of Canterbury, whence Ussher has published itin his Sylloge,* together with the following form ofPatrick s profession of obedience on being so conesletter is also the thirty-sixth among Lanfranc s letters, inD Acherv s edition of his works.PATRICK. 29crated in St. Paul s church : " Whoever is appointedto rule over others, ought not to think it unworthy ifhe also be placed in subjection to others ; but oughtrather to study, in all humility, to pay that obedienceto his superiors which he expects, for God s sake, toreceive from those that are subject to him. Wherefore,I, Patrick, having been elected bishop, to presideover Dublin, the metropolis of Ireland, do tenderthis instrument of my profession to you, most venerablefather, Lanfranc, primate of the Britain, (Britannique,i. e. England and Scotland,) and Archbishopof the holy church of Canterbury, and dopromise that I will obey you and your successors, inall things which appertain to the Christian religionThe copies of the letters which Lanfranc sent bythis bishop, to be delivered to the said Gotred, and toTurlough O Brien, King of Ireland, are likewisepreserved in Cardinal Baronies s Annals ; while it isto be observed, that Lanfranc, not having sufficientexperience in Irish affairs, styles not only Turlough,King of Ireland, as he really was, but also gives Gotree the same designation, who was only a ruler overDublin and a small part of Leinster. The lettersare as follow : " Lanfranc, by the grace of Godand not in respect to his own merits Archbishop ofCanterbury, to Gotred, the renowned King of Ireland,greeting, with his benediction. We have honourablyand with due respects received our venerable brotherand fellow bishop, Patrick, (whom, most reverendson, your Excellency sent unto us for consecration,)and have invested him in the sacred function with all30 BISHOPS OF DUBLIN.due ceremonies, and the co-operating grace of theHoly Ghost, according to canonical institution, andhave remitted him to his proper see, with our letterstestimonial, pursuant to the practice of our predecessors.And, although he has related to us many goodand commendable things concerning your glory, yetwe think it not amiss to enforce your noble designsby our exhortations ; for, as the fire is increased bythe blowing of the wind, and shines more bright, sotrue virtue is improved and increased by well-meritedpraises. We therefore entreat you, in such manner asbecomes a precious son of the Church to be intreated,that you will, with all sincerity of mind, preserve undefiledthe true faith delivered by God and his holyapostles and the orthodox fathers ; that you willexhibit to the world such good works as are agreeableto the faith, according to the extent of your abilities,and shew your greatness severe to the proud butaffable to the humble. It is reported, that withinyour dominions there are men, who take to themselveswives too near a-kin by consanguinity or affinity;others, who forsake at pleasure such as are lawfullyjoined to them in holy matrimony ; and some, whogive their wives to others, and receive the wives ofothers in return by an abominable intercourse. Theseand other, if there are any other, enormities, youshould order to be corrected, for God s sake and thegood of your own soul, in the country of your dominion.You are to carry yourself, by the assistanceof God, towards your subjects in such manner, thatthey, who are affected by virtue, may love virtue thePATRICK. 31more, and such, as are wickedly disposed, may berestrained in the exercise of their vicious courses.For doing this you shall reign the longer on earth,in the enjoyment of temporal felicity, and, after thislife, shall pass to a celestial kingdom, there to rei-nwithout end. I should have written to you more atlarge, but that you have with you the aforesaid prelate,educated from his boyhood in monastic institutions,eminently instructed in the knowledge of divinelearning, and (as far as it has come to our knowledge)well graced with the ornaments of good works ;if you will attentively hearken unto him, (as he shallfrequently speak to you concerning your soul,) hearinghim to obey him as a spiritual father, in suchthings as appertain to God, doing as he declares toyou, and treasuring his words in your breast ; we thenhope that by the mercy of God, neither yourself willperniciously go astray, nor permit your subjects toabide long in the obstinacy of wicked actions. Theomnipotent Lord fortify you with the arm of virtueagainst the enemies of your soul and body, and, aftera long life in this world, happily bring you to thatwhich hath no end."The archbishop s letter to King Turlough, runsthus : " Lanfranc, a sinner, and unworthy archbishopof the holy Church of Canterbury, to Turlough,the mighty king of Ireland, a blessing with ourgreeting and prayers. God bestowed no greatermercies on earth, than when he promote to thegovernment of souls or bodies, such as affect peaceand work justice ; and especially when he committed32 BISHOPS OF DUBLIN.the kingdoms of the world to good kings. For hencepeace arises, discord is extinguished, and, that I maysum up all in a word, the observance of Christianreligion is established ; which blessing every prudentobserver perceives to have been divinely conferred onthe people of Ireland, when the omnipotent Lordgranted unto your superiority the right of kinglypower over that land. For our brother and fellowbishop, Patrick, hath declared so many, and suchgood and great things of your humility towards goodmen,of your rigorous severity against the wicked,and of your well disposed justice and equity towardsall mankind, that, although we never saw you, yet welove you as if we had seen you ; and we desire togive you wholesome council, and to serve you as sincerely,as if you were seen by and well known untous. But, amongst many things which please us, somethings have been related unto us wherewith we aredispleased, (viz.) that in your kingdom any one atpleasure relinquishes his lawful wife, without anycanonical cause intervening, and rashly joins himselfby a marital, or rather an adulterous law, with onenearly a-kin to himself, or to his deserted wife, orwith another by similar depravity deserted by herhusband : that bishops are consecrated by one bishoponly ; that infants are baptized without consecratedoil ; and that holy orders are conferred by bishops formoney. There is no man so meanly versed in holywrit, but knows that all these things, and other thelike, if any, are done contrary to evangelical andapostolical authority, against the prohibition of thePATRICK. 33holy canons, and against the institutions of all theorthodox fathers who have gone before us. Whichthings, by as much as they are abhorred in the sightof God and his saints, so much the more severely arethey to be prohibited by your command without delay,and being prohibited, if they be not corrected, youare to punish them with the strictest severity of yourterror. For you cannot offer to God a greater ormore acceptable present, than to study to governdivine and human things by proper laws. Wherefore,as always mindful of the divine judgment, whereinyou are to render an account to God of the kingdomcommitted to you, command all bishops and religiousmen to convene together, and in their holy conferencebe you present with your nobles, to exterminatefrom your kingdom these wicked customs, andall others which are condemned by the laws of religion: so that, when the King of kings and Lord oflords shall see your royal majesty subject in all thingsto his precepts, and favourable to his faithful peopleout of fear and love for him, and possessed with zealagainst the enemies of the true religion, he may propitiouslyhear your faithful subjects crying unto him,astound your enemies, and grant to you in this worlda firm peace, and in the world to come eternal life."Although it may be observed that Lanfranc, whendeprecating the abuses alleged in the latter letter,does not speak in any tone of authority, nor issue anyorders, as a metropolitan, to the Irish bishops andclergy, but only recommends their prince to convenethem, and facilitate the exercise of their power ofD34 BISHOPS OF DUBLIN.correction for the good of his own soul, and althoughthe letter to Gotred is also but a pious exhortation,yet the fact of this and subsequent instances of theinterference of the Archbishop of Canterbury in theconsecration of Irish bishops, requires here, as onits earliest undoubted occurrence, some especial explanation,reminding the ordinary reader, as it may bescarcely necessary to do, that Plan franc himself derivedhis pall from Rome. During the long periodof Danish tyranny in Ireland, and while frequent intercoursewith the Pontiff was impracticable, themetropolitan of Armagh seems to have been moreparticularly respected as his vicar, and a paramountecclesiastical power was acknowledged as consequentialby all the Christians of Ireland. The Danes,however, of the sea-ports did not deem it politic, norwould they submit to have their bishops derived fromsuch a sanction, and, as they always disdained to attributetheir conversion to the Irish, but rather to theAnglo-saxons, and further considered William theConqueror and his Normans, who were then mastersof England, their countrymen, they naturally lookedin such a state of things to the English primate forthe consecration of their bishops, and, accordingly,the practice commenced with this prelate s consecration.His successor, Donatus O Manly, succeededby similar authority in 1085, as did Samuel, the nephewof Donatus, on his decease. Easier, the friendand historian of Archbishop Anselm, with more policythan veracity, records the latter appointment as havingbeen "juxtamorem antique," as indeed LanfrancDon't O HANLY. 35would assume at the higher period of his prelacy, inhis aforesaid letter to Gotred. In 1097 9 the samefeeling threw the nomination of a Bishop of Waterford,Malchus, into Anselm s jurisdiction ; and, inletters from Anselm as well to the before-mentionedSamuel as to this Malchus, further claims to metropolitanjurisdiction are insinuated and acted upon.Indeed, the whole spirit, that induced these nominations,is clearly evinced by a letter hereafter moreparticularly alluded to, from the people of Dublinto Ralph, Archbishop of Canterbury, about theyear 1121, wherein they avow the jealousy they hadincurred from the Irish bishops, and particularly fromthe " bishop who dwells at Armagh," by reason ofnot submitting to their ordination.Patrick, having been in this spirit and under theseauspices elected and consecrated, governed the seeabout ten years, when, in a voyage to England, whitherhe was sent by King Turlough on business toLanfranc, he perished by shipwreck, on the 10th ofOctober, 1084.Don't O HANLY.[Succ. 1085, Ob. 1095.]Donat O Vainly or O Manly, having spent sometimein the study of useful learning in Ireland, passedinto England and became a Benedictine monk atCanterbury. Returning to the former country, hewas elected by King Turlough and the clergy andpeople of Dublin, with the approbation of some IrishD 236 manors OF DUBLIN.bishops to the see of Dublin, and, on their representtion, was consecrated in 1085 by Archbishop Lanfranc,to whom he made the following profession ofobedience : " I Donat, bishop of the church of Dublinin Ireland, do promise canonical obedience to you,Plan franc, Archbishop of the holy church of Canterbury,and to your successors." The epistle, whichKing Turlough sent to Lanfranc in his favour, isstated by Ware in the following words : " Turlough,King of Ireland, to the Most Rev. Father in God,Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, greeting, We,Turlough and the clergy of Dublin, being bereavedof our good and pious pastor, Patrick, are grieved inadouble sense, first, for his sad misfortune, beingswallowed up in the deep ; secondly, for the loss ofhis wholesome doctrine, with which he was wont tofeed our souls. Had he safely arrived, you wouldhave had an account how I have followed your fatherlyinstructions, which you recommended to meby our late deceased father. But this Donat, who wedesire may be consecrated by your fatherhood andthe rest of the holy prelates belonging to your holysee, will inform you further. Grace, peace, and happinessattend on you and your followers, Amen."This bishop, it appears, was a particular favouritewith Lanfranc, who frequently entertained him in hispalace, and gave him sundry presents, in particularsome books and church ornaments for his cathedral ofthe Holy Trinity. He died on the 23rd of November,in the year 1095, of a plague, the prevalence ofwhich in that year is recorded in the Annals of In-SAMUEL O HANLY. 37riisfallen, and left behind him among his countrymen ahigh reputation for industry, learning, and sagacity.*SAMUEL O HANLY.[Succ. 1095, Ob. 1121.]Samuel O Manly, nephew to the deceased Donat,and a Benedictine monk as his uncle had been, succeededto the see. Eadmerf thus alludes to his consecration: 6( In the year 1095 one Samuel, a nativeof Ireland, and a monk of the abbey of St. Alban s,Jcame to Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury. He,upon the death of Donat, late bishop of the city ofDublin, of blessed memory's, by Furlough O Brien,King of Ireland, and the clergy and people, electedbishop of that city, and, according to ancient custom,was by common suffrage recommended to Anselmfor consecration ; Anselm approved the election andgranted their petition. He honourably entertainedthe man in his house for a time, and diligently instructedhim how to behave himself in the house ofGod ; then taking from him a profession of hiscanonical obedience, he consecrated him bishop inthe octave of Easter following, and four of his suffraganbishops ministered to him during the ceremony.This new prelate, strengthened by the benedictionof so great a prince, and with letters testimonialWare s Bishops, ( Harris s Ed.) p. 309.t Hist.

The narrative is evidently the productionof one, anxious to promote the interest andpower of Anselm, and, while it seeks to suggest anancient custom" for such consecrations, it is possiblyequally sycophantic in the assertion of KingFurlough s recommendation of Samuel, which might,however, be given, like that of his royal predecessorTurlough, in deference to the Ostmen citizens ofDublin.Samuel s profession, as preserved in Ussher s Syl-loge, was in these terms, " I Samuel, chosen for thegovernment of the church of Dublin, which is situatedin Ireland, and to be consecrated bishop by thereverend father Anselm, Archbishop of the holychurch of Canterbury, and primate of all Britain, dopromise that I will observe canonical obedience in allthings to thee and all thy successors." It may be interestingto remark, that the consecration of thisbishop took place in the cathedral of Winchester,when it was in all the freshness of its beauty, beingthen but two years completed, and within five yearsof the period when it was to receive the corse of theroyal Rufus.Samuel, soon after his return to Ireland, expelledsome monks from the cathedral of the Holy Trinity,stripped that church of the books and ornaments whichLanfranc had bestowed on it, as before observed, andcommanded the cross to be carried before himself; inSAMUEL O HANLY. 39consequence of which, Anselm wrote a letter to him,also preserved in Ussher s Sylloge, and of which thefollowing is a translation : " Anselm, Archbishop ofCanterbury, &c., to his venerable brother Samuel,Bishop of Dublin, greeting, Complaint hath beenmade unto us, that you dispose of and alienate tostrangers those books, vestments, and other ornamentsof the church, which Archbishop Lanfranc bestowedon your uncle, Bishop Donat, to the use of thechurch over which you preside. If this be true,I much wonder at it, for these ornaments werenot given to your uncle but to the church, asthe brothers and sons of the church of Canterburydo attest. Therefore, I admonish and commandyou, that, if any of the aforesaid things be disposedof out of the church, you immediately causethem to be restored to it. I have, likewise, heardthat you have expelled and dispersed several ofthe monks appointed to serve in the said church,and that, though they are willing to return, you willnot receive them back. If this be so, it is very unbecomingin you, whose duty it is rather to collectthe scattered, than to scatter those who are collected.Wherefore, I command you, if any have been expelledand are willing to return and continue in theservice of God, under obedience, that you receivethem, and studiously employ your paternal affectionfor their preservation, unless, which God forbid, theygive cause to obstruct their own restoration. I have,also, heard that you cause your cross to be carried40 BISHOPS OF DUBLIN 1 .erect before you, in the way ; if this be true, I forbidit for the future, because it belongs to none but anarchbishop, confirmed by the grant of the pall fromthe Roman Pontiff. Neither does it become you toshew yourself reprehensible to men, by presumingon such an unusual thing : farewell"* Anselm alsowrote to Malchus Bishop of Waterford a letter, preservedin the Sylloge, in which he repeats the abovecauses of complaint, adds, that he ordered the peopleof Dublin to prevent the removal of the articles belongingto the church, and desires him to expostulateviva voce with Samuel, and advise him to obey themonitory letter, which he enclosed to Malchus withthe object of a personal delivery. It does not appearhow far these charges of avarice and sacrilegiouspeculation were justified, or what effect the remonstranceaccomplished, and it is only known that, accordingto the best authorities, Bishop Samuel diedon the 4th of July, in the year 1121, although theAnnals of St. Mary s Abbey, and some ancient rollsin Lambeth, postpone this event to the followingyear, and those of Multifernan to 1123.fImmediately on his decease, there is some evidencethat Celsus, Bishop of Armagh, was entreatedto preside over this see, and Doctor Lanigan, withan acuteness that makes his lightest conjectures welldeserving of notice, in any theological question connectedwith the period of which he wrote, considersit probable, that, without intending to be a pluralist,Usser.

The Irishbishops, and particularly Celsus, must have consideredit anomalous, that the diocese of Dublin should beseparated from the Irish hierarchy, after Waterfordand Limerick, the only other sees which had for similarreasons sought consecration of their prelates inEngland, had been, by a decree of the synod of Rath-brasil, placed under the Archbishop of Cashel. Theopinion is considerably strengthened by the terms ofthe recommendation which the Danish party forwardedwith Gregory to Canterbury, as stated in theensuing paragraph. No evidence, however, has beendiscovered of Celsus having actually exercised any ofthe functions of Bishop of Dublin.GREGORY.[Succ. 1121. Ob. 1161.]This prelate, having been elected Bishop of Dublin,repaired to England to receive a similar consecrationwith that of his immediate predecessors from theArchbishop of Canterbury ; and, besides letters fromthe king in his favour, he carried also with him otherrecommendations from the clergy and people of Dublin,in which they emphatically urged, that they hadincurred much jealousy from the bishops of Ireland,and especially from the prelate who lived at Armagh,42 BISHOPS OF DUBLIN.because they would not obey the order of the saidbishops, but testified their wish to live under the jurisdictionof Canterbury.* In pursuance of these testimonialsGregory received his first orders from RogerBishop of Salisbury, on the 24th of September, 1121;and on the 2nd of October following, having madethe customary profession of obedience, was consecratedBishop of Dublin, at Lambeth, by Ralph Archbishopof Canterbury, assisted by the prelates Richard ofLondon, the said Roger of Salisbury, Robert of Lincoln,Everard of Norwich, and David of Bangor. Theform of his profession is published by ArchbishopUssher, and is in similar terms with that of his predecessors.On the 24th of the said month of Octoberhe assisted, together with Theulph Bishop of Worcester,Richard Bishop of Hereford, and Urban Bishopof Glamorgan, in consecrating the great church ofTewkesbury, then recently raised to the dignity ofan abbey.After he had presided thirty-one years over hissec, the archiepiscopal dignity was conferred upon himat the Council of Kells,t the causes and acts of whichassembly require here more especial notice.It is scarcely necessary perhaps to suggest, that,from the period of the Danish invasion, the march ofreligion and morality was cruelly checked in Ireland.Christianity, up to that era, which may be defined asthe commencement of the ninth century, had, asCambrensis admits, remained there untainted and uniteUssher s Sylloge, p. 101.t Harris s Ware s Bishops, p. 31 1.GREGORY. 43shaken, ("illibata et inconcussa;") but thenceforwardthe Christian resident priesthood could only preservetheir lives in the intricacy of woods, and bogs, andcaverns ; and, while the expatriated portion of theclergy were leading the most successful and gloriousmissions in foreign countries, there is much reason tobelieve that deviations, both in discipline and morality,were the result of this breaking up of the ecclesiasticalcommunities in Ireland. In vain, at the momentof deepest moral degradation, did Brian Boroimheapply his utmost exertions to recal his erring subjects,and efface from their manners and habits those taintswith which they had been imbued ; not even the partialsubsequent conversion of the Danes could effectuatethese objects. If the picture drawn by the pen ofSt. Bernard were deemed accurate to the whole extent,the degeneracy in his day, or rather in thosedays of St. Malachy of which he wrote, was indeeddeplorable ;* and Adrian s Bull to Henry the Secondintimates as much, at a later period, where he incitesthe royal missionary to subdue the Irish to the laws,and to extirpate from amongst them the nurseries ofvice. The Archbishop of Canterbury had, duringnearly a century, as has been shewn, assumed to exercisea metropolitan jurisdiction in appointing andordaining bishops for the Danish settlements, comprehendingthe chief cities of Ireland, while the prelatesof those parts of the country, which were possessed bythe natives, appear, in the difficulty of intercourseVita Malachi. c. 6.44 BISHOPS OF DUBLIN.thence with Rome, and the decided laxity of discipline,to have assumed to consecrate each other. Thisusage, however it might have been tolerated for atime from necessity, was not calculated to upholdthe desired unity of Roman Catholic doctrine anddiscipline, and, in point of fact, mainly led to someof the aberrations alluded to. It was now, therefore,deemed advisable at the Court of Rome, that Irelandshould be divided into ecclesiastical provinces, andarchbishops assigned over them, by whom the suffragansmight be thenceforth appointed. Accordinglyit was proposed, in 1 151, that Cardinal Paparo shouldvisit Ireland for the attainment of this object; and alicense of safe conduct was applied for from the Kingof England, but refused by him, unless the ecclesiasticwould pledge his faith, that the expedition shouldoperate no prejudice to the English nation. In 1 152,however, the same missionary, having first debarkedat Monmouth, in Northumberland, and been well receivedby the Bishop of Durham, proceeded thenceto Ireland, under conduct from the King of Scotland.Immediately on his arrival at the place of his destinationhe convened a synod, at which he and ChristianO Conor, Bishop of Lismore, presided as thePope s legates. It was held in March at the ancienttown of Tells, according to the most approved authorities,though others state Drogheda, and some Bellesto have been the place of meeting. The assemblageon the occasion comprised the chief personagesof Ireland bishops, abbots, princes, and chiefs.

Therewere present, besides these prelates, according to theAnnals of the Four Masters, three thousand otherecclesiastics. By the decision of this council the Irishbishoprics were reduced to a fewer number, and fourarchbishops were established, to whom the sacred pallswere given. Pelagius was appointed to preside overthe province of Armagh, Donatus assigned to that ofCashel, Tetanus to Tuam, and Gregory was elevatedfrom bishop of the see to be Archbishop of the provinceof Dublin ; while to each a certain number ofsuffragan bishops was subjected. Those, placed underthe government of Gregory and his successors, were46 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.Glendalough, Ferns, Leighlin, Ossory, and Kildare.Besides the delivery of the palls, other matters of highecclesiastical importance were transacted on this occasion.A decree was passed against simony, a crimewhich was in those times but too prevalent throughoutthe Christian world ; usury also was condemned ;marriages within the canonical degrees, which had becometoo prevalent in this country, were expresslyprohibited ;* and the cardinal, in virtue of his apostolicalauthority, directed that tithes should be paid.On this point, however, he was very badly obeyed,and tithes were, if at all, very little exacted in Ireland,until after the establishment of English power.On the breaking up of the synod Paparo immediatelyreturned to Rome.Although no decrees were deemed necessary toCollier, v. xxi. p. 691.

Mr. Moorehas perhaps somewhat hastily in his History of Ireland, v. ii. p. 191,stated this canon as prohibitory of the marriages of the clergy, and hasbeen very severe upon Doctor Lanigan, for what he terms an unworthysuppression of the enactment ; but the truth is, that there is no authoritywhatsoever to support the statement ; the only passages in Irishecclesiastical history that can be cited, as giving colour to such marriagesat the time, refer to the diocese of Armagh alone, and theseapply more to the laymen who usurped that see as their inheritance forfive or six generations, and whom Mr. Moore recognises as such in thesame volume, pp. 65, 171, 304, and 341. See also St. Bernard s LifeofMalachy, c. 7. The Irish Annals, and particularly those of the FourMasters, repudiate any such general imputation: while the reluctanttestimony of Cambrensis to the purity of the native priesthood,and yet more the remarkable avowal in the thirteenth canon of ArchbishopComyn s council of 1 186, that the clergy of Ireland were alwaysremarkable for their chastity, are completely subversive oftheproba-bihty of such a canon.GREGORY. 47be passed on this occasion, in reference to the doctrinesor the morality of the people much less of theclergy, King Henry the Second was, on his accessionto the throne in two years afterwards, too deeply interestedin reiterating and magnifying at Rome suchcalumnious accounts of Ireland, as would impress thepontiff with the importance and utility of his meditatedinvasion of that country. Fortunately for hiswishes an Englishman, Adrian the Fourth, had beenadvanced to that high office, about the very same timethat he had himself attained his kingdom. To him,therefore, did Henry make his earliest application onthe subject of Ireland, communicating the necessityand motives of his design through the medium ofJohn of Salisbury, then chaplain to Theobald Archbishopof Canterbury. The wily negotiator was wellselected for the office : he besought the Pope s permissionfor his master to take possession of Ireland,purely for the extension of morality and religion. Hemade his suit with the earnestness of a Christian minister;* he implored it, as if only actuated by a tendercommiseration for the souls of the poor deludedIrish ; he persevered he succeeded and the Englishprince was, like another Joshua, commissioned " topossess the land" for the glory of God and salvationof its people.It is by many considered incredible that the Popecould have listened to, much less have so thoroughlyadopted these suggestions, as to recite them to a cereSarisb.

Adrian might havebeen, however, the more disposed to credit these interestedrepresentations, as it appears that in hisyouth he had made a painful pilgrimage into Norway,where, in the progress of conversion, he possibly heardequally interested misrepresentations of the Irish, froma people who had for ages been their tyrants andoppressors. The love of England, his native country,was likely also to have deeply biased his inclinations,and such a motive was consequently assigned byMatthew of Westminster, strongly asserted by DonaldO Neill and the Irish chieftains in their letters toPope John the Twenty-second, and subsequently suggestedand accredited in a speech of Cardinal Polein Ad. 1554.* But more than all, it is most reasonableto infer that Adrian consented to the appointment,politically concluding that Henry was thebest qualified to establish the desired conformity withRoman discipline. He knew that Ireland, by beingsubjected in a temporal sense to England, would bemore spiritually reduced to the authority of theChurch, while Henry on his part covenanted to be acollector of its rents and dues for the apostolic see.With such impressions and motives, Pope AdrianSee Usser. Syll. n. to Adrian s Bull.GREGORY. 49transmitted, through the aforesaid John of Salisbury,as an investiture of dominion over Ireland, a ring,which John himself states was preserved in the statemuniments in his day, and with it an official Bull, ofwhose existence also, as of record in Winchester,Giraldus is equally certain. In this Bull, after dulycommending Henry s motives as originating in thezeal of faith and love of Christianity, and directedfor the extension of the supremacy of Rome, thejurisdiction of its Church over an unlearned and barbarouspeople, and the extirpation of the weeds ofvice from the field of the Lord ; and, after auguringthe success of their execution from the purity of theirconception, and especially from the submission madeto and sanction sought from Home, the Pontiff proceedsto recite his own title to Ireland, as foundedon a vaunted grant of all the islands of the Christianworld from the Emperor Constantine to the successorsof St. Peter, and again reverts to Henry s motivesas having been signified to him to be for subjectingthe Irish to laws, extirpating vice, collecting Peter spence, and preserving the Church rights in the island;he, therefore, gives his assent to the pious and praiseworthydesire of the English king, and agrees thatfor such purposes he should enter the island, and dowhatever might best tend to the honour of God andsafety of that land ; expressing at the same time ahope, that the people of the country would receivehim with honour, and respect him as their lord ; andhe concludes with a still more impressive, and an unquestionablymeritorious line of instruction, whichE50 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.had Henry adopted, had his soldiery " sowed righteousnessand reaped in mercy," the land mightrejoice in the invasion that extinguished her disastrousconstitution. "If then," he adds, "you areminded to effectuate your purpose, make it yourstudy to inform that nation with good precepts, anddo this as well by your own exertions, as by thoseof whomsoever you may depute as fitted for such adesign by their doctrine, conversation, and life ; sothat the Church may be glorified thereby, and thereligion of Christ planted and increased, and whateverpertains to the honour of God and safety ofsouls may be so perfected, as that you will deserve toobtain from that God an accumulation of eternal rewards,and must succeed in acquiring on earth aglorious fame for ages."Thus it was that Adrian countenanced the transferof a kingdom, which in no manner belonged to him,to a prince who had no manner of right to it ; an exerciseof authority so unwarranted in the abstract,that a host of historians have ventured at once to impugnthe authenticity of the instrument altogether,and such a conclusion has been too hastily consideredas necessary for the honour of the country and of thePope. The leading objections urged against thedocument, are embodied in Lynch s CambrensisVersus, c. 22, but their enumeration, or that of theevidences which establish the authenticity of the Bull,appears irrelevant in the present work.The instrument was not fated to be acted uponduring the life of Archbishop Gregory, who died onLAURENCE O Tools, 51the 8th of October, in the year 1161, having filledthe see for forty years. The Chronicle of All Saintscharacterizes him as " a wise man, and one wellskilled in languages," but erroneously assigns hisdeath to the year 1162.LAURENCE o Tools.[Succ. 11G2, Ob. 1180.]Laurence O Toole, the truly illustrious individualwho succeeded to this high preferment, was theyoungest son of the hereditary lord or petty princeof the territory of Imaile, the head of one of the septseligible to the kingdom of Leinster, and which maintainedthe privilege of electing the bishops and abbotsof Glendalough, even for centuries after that see wasde jure united to that of Dublin. His father s principalitywas situated in the district of Wicklow, to whichhe was also attached in the maternal line, his motherhaving been of the O Byrncs, a family equally reveredin the memory of their countrymen. In thedepth of the romantic " valley of the two lakes, :which gave name to the see of Glendalough, andwhere the ruins of its little city and cathedral arct-till traceable, there was, at this period, one of thoseschools, for which Ireland was justly celebrated, andwithin its walls the pious Laurence imbibed the rudimentsof his education, and the principles of his religion.At the early age of ten, his acquirementselevated him considerably above the ordinary class ofhis contemporaries, and the infant ardour of hisE 252 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.patriotism so manifested itself, that when at thatperiod his father participated in the oppressive hostilities,with which Dermot Mac Furlough visited themost worthy of the chieftains of Leinster, the heartlesstyrant could only be induced to avert the worstinflictions of his cruel power, on receiving as a hostagefrom the father s hands the son of his heart andhopes.No sooner had Dermot possessed himself of thisalready celebrated boy, than he subjected him to thefirst lessons of the persecution he was fated to endure,and with a fiendish cruelty, in thorough consistencewith the character which even his Welch allies afterwardsattributed to him, he is said to have confinedhis victim in a barren, unsheltered spot, and onlyallowed him such a quality and quantity of food asmight preserve an existence for tyranny to excruciate.The distracted parent, when he heard of hisson s stuttering, knowing that entreaty would be respondedwith mockery and increased barbarity, bysome successful sally from his mountain holds, capturedtwelve of Mac Furlough s soldiers, whom hethreatened instantly to immolate, unless his son wasrestored to his home. The threat was effective, andm the valley of Glendalough Laurence was oncemore received in a father s embrace. The secludedand melancholy appearance of this scene, surroundedas it is by almost perpendicular mountains on all sidesbut the east, where alone it opens like a vast templeof nature to the rising day, early marked it as themore peculiar retreat of holiness, and must haverLAURENCE o Tools. 53greatly influenced the determination of the redeemedboy, who, thereupon, again applied himself to hisstudies, in the place where his rudiments were imbibed,and, ultimately resigning the prospects of hisbirth and inheritance, devoted his great talents to theservice of religion, and exhibited such eminent proofsof his knowledge, devotion, purity, and high morality,that, in the twenty-fifth year of his age, at the importunityof the clergy and people of the district, he wasadvanced to preside over that abbey, whose ruins stillaffect the observer with inexpressible reverence, and,if not forming the most imposing feature at Glendaleat least powerfully deepen its interest. Hischarity to the poor at this time is much commemorated,especially during a period of remarkable scarcity,which miserably afflicted that part of the countryduring four successive years ; nor is it to be overlooked,that by the rectitude of his conduct throughoutthis interval of his life, he confounded the effortsof calumny, and, by the firm but merciful superintendenceof the district under his charge, convertedit from a wicked waste to moral cultivation. Theresult was to himself as might be expected ; and whenthe bishop of the see, Gilds na Naomi, died, Laurencewas at once selected by a grateful people to fillthe vacant dignity. He, however, utterly declinedthis honour, wisely and prudently excusing himself byreason of the fewness of his years. Providence reservedhim for a more exalted and useful sphere ofaction ; and, on the death of Gregory, Archbishopof Dublin, which soon afterwards occurred, he was54 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.elected the successor ; a promotion which he wouldalso have declined, but was ultimately induced to accept,by earnest representations of the good he mightthus effectuate. He was, accordingly, consecrated inChrist Church, Dublin, in the year 1162, by Gela-sins,Archbishop of Armagh, assisted by many bishops,the people offering up the thanksgivings oftheir hearts ; and, from that period the custom ofsending the bishops of the Irish cities which theDanes had occupied, to Canterbury for consecration,was utterly discontinued.In the following year, Archbishop O Toole engagedthe secular clergy of his cathedral of the HolyTrinity, to receive the rule of the regular canons ofArabia, an abbey, which was founded in the dioceseof Arras, about eighty years previously, and hadacquired such a reputation for sanctity and exemplarydiscipline, that it became the head, or motherchurch of a numerous congregation. The betterto recommend this change, the archbishop himselfassumed the habit of that order, which he thenceforthalways wore under his pontifical attire, andequally submitted himself to their mortifications andrules of living. Although he studiously avoidedall popular applause, yet his continued charity to thepoor could not be concealed. He caused every day,sometimes sixty, sometimes forty paupers to be fedin his presence, besides many whom he otherwiserelieved ; he entertained the rich with suitable splendour,yet, never himself tasted the luxuries of thetable, and, as frequently as his duties would permit,LAURENCE O*TOOLE. 55retreated to the scene of his early sanctity, where inthe cave, still shewn as the labour of St. Kevin sself-inflictions, removed from human intercourse, heindulged himself in holy thinking.In 1167 he assisted at the council which KingRoderic convened at Athboy, and which, in themixed grades of those who attended it, greatly resembleda Saxon Wittenagemote. " Thither," accordingto the Annals of the Four Masters, " camethe eomorb of Patrick; Catholics O Dusty, Archbishopof Connaught ; Laurence O Toole, Archbishopof Leinster; Tiernan OTlourkc, Lord ofBrefny ; Donough O Carrol, Lord of Uriel, the sonof the King of Glad ; Dcrmod O Melaghlin, Kingof Tara ; Raynal Mac llaynal, Lord of the Danes ;Donough O Faolan, Chief of the Desires ; &c. Thecomplement of the whole so collected was, (Junoof Connaught, 4000 with OTlourke, 2000 withO Melaghlin 4000 with O Carrol and the son ofthe King of Glad, 2000 with Donough O Faolan, and1000 with the Danes of Dublin." The politicalobject of this assembly was, to obtain more indisputableacknowledgments of the sovereignty of Roderic,and to calculate what aid and support he might expect,in case of the then expected invasion of DermotMac Furlough s auxiliaries. The council did not,however, separate without passing many good ordinances,touching the privileges of churches andclergy, and the regulation of public morality, andreligious discipline. Archbishop Laurence also pressARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.sided as legate at a clerical convocation, held atClonfert in 1170, by commission from the Pope.Upon the first invasion of the Welch adventurers,he adhered firmly to the independence of hiscountry, and encouraged the inhabitants of Dublinto a vigorous defence against the invaders; they,however, daunted by the martial appearance, anddisciplined array of Strongbow s forces before theirwalls, entreated the prelate, rather to become themediator of a peace ; to effectuate which, he passedout into the lines of the besiegers, but, while theterms of surrender were yet under discussion,Raymond le Gros, and Milo de Cogan, with a partyof young and fiery spirits, scaled the walls, and atonce possessed themselves of the city, with frightfulcarnage. The charity of Archbishop O Toole waseminently exercised on this occasion. At the hazardof his life, he traversed the streets of the metropolis,protesting against the ruin he could not control ;snatching the panting bodies from the grasp of theinvader, he administered to the dying the last consolationsof religion, to the dead, the hasty service ofa grave, and to the wants and wounds of the wretchedsurvivors, all. that their necessities could require, orhis means afford.In 1 171 Hasculph, the Danish Governor of Dublin,whom the English had expelled from the city, arrivedin its harbour to re-assert his rights, with thirty shipsin his train, and a numerous force commanded byJohn Wood, from the Isle of Man and the islands ofLAURENCE o lOQLE. 57the North, and described in the Irish Annals aswell appointed, after the Danish manner, with brigantines,jacks and coats of mail, their shields,bucklers, and targets round and coloured red, andbound about with iron." Archbishop Laurence onthis occasion, considering that much national goodmight result, from opposing the power of the newinvaders by that of the old, became most zealousin his appeals to the native princes to promoteHasculph s project, and his devoted patriotism andthe sanctity of his character gave great weight tohis exhortations. The people rose in arms to his call,collected all their strength, surrounded Dublin byland while the Dane occupied the harbour, andthreatened the hitherto victorious Strongbow withtotal annihilation. From the height of the citadelhe beheld with alarm the allied natives, at lastunited in the defence of their country, and extendingtheir lines from sea to sea around him. Rodericwas encamped at Castleknock, whence his army extendedto the ancient town of Finglas ; O Rourkeand the petty prince of Ulster mingled their forcesalong the strand of Clontarf ; the Lord of Hy occupied the opposite shores of Dalkey ; whilethe Chief of Thorn ont advanced so near as Kilmain-ham, to the walls of the metropolis ; and evenArchbishop Laurence communicated the inspirationof his character to this cause, and gliding amidst theranks of war, animated the several septs of hiscountrymen to the assertion of their common liberosARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.ties.* Within the city were. Earl Strongbow,Maurice Fitzgerald, Raymond le Gros, the Achillesof the invasion, Milo de Cogan, Richard de Cogan, andsome other chosen chieftains ; but their scanty soldierybore a fearful comparison in numbers with the hostthat were to oppose them ; and Strongbow, in theprudence of necessity, withheld them from any encounterthat might but reveal their weakness. Itwas the crisis of Ireland s destinies, but her monarchwas not equal to the emergency.During two months, these warriors patientlyendured the closest blockade, but after that interval,a privation of food, so grievous, that according toBegan, a measure of wheat was sold for a mark, andone of barley for half a mark, threatened the garrisonwith the most terrific species of death. In thisemergency, rather than pine under the lingeringinfliction of famine, they loudly implored their commandersto lead them against the enemy, and affordthem at least the glorious consolation of dying onthe field of battle. In aggravation of their despair,and the imminence of their fate, came fearfulaccounts of the state of Fits Stephen and his followersin Wexford. A council was thereupon held,and an ineffectual effort having been made, underits direction, to obtain favourable terms by negotiation,it was resolved, without further delay, to sallyon the besiegers. The garrison was accordinglydivided into three companies ; Raymond le Gros,Camb. Every. p. 165.LAURENCE o Tools. 5 ( Jwith 200 knights, took the vanguard, Milo deCogan, with as many more, kept the centre, andStrongbow, with Maurice Fits Gerald, and 200knights and soldiers, composed the rear, sufficientnumbers being left to guard and secure the city.Early on the following morning, when the nativeswere least expecting an assault, the appointed detachmentsimpatiently sallied from the city, andfalling on the wing of Roderic s army, completelybroke down any opposition it was able to offer, andfollowing up their advantage along the monarch s line,slew without mercy, even until the fall of night, whenthey returned to the city, wearied by their bloody victory,but much enriched with spoils, and with whatwas then even more welcome, ample stores of provisions.Roderic himself narrowly escaped beingtaken prisoner. The native chieftains fled in everydirection, and the allies from the isles took to seawithout another effort. Hasculph himself, however,was taken prisoner as he was hurrying to his ship,and having, when brought before the English leader,expressed himself in terms deemed unbecoming, andcertainly imprudent in a captive, was instantly orderedto execution. Milo de Cogan was thereupon re-instated in the government of Dublin, and Strongbowmarched with his adherents to the relief of FitsStephen in Wexford.The political exertions of the archbishop werenot, however, paralyzed by these unexpected discomfitures.With unwearied zeal he still laboured toorganize an effective opposition against Strongbow()0 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.and his followers, but the arrival of King Henry theSecond at Waterford, in the October following, withconsiderable forces, having given a new character tothe invasion, and most of the leading men of Irelandhaving submitted to him, Laurence, together withthe principal archbishops, bishops, and abbots of thecountry, repaired to that city, and, in obedience tothe bull of Pope Adrian, then for the first time exhibited,respectively submitted themselves to him, theEnglish king, as their temporal lord and ruler. Inthe Christmas following, Archbishop Laurence assistedat the synod convened at Cashel by the king sorders, wherein several canons were established forthe prevention of marriages within certain degrees ofkindred, the more solemn administration of baptism,the due payment of parochial tithes, the immunity ofchurch lands and of the clergy from secular exactions,the distribution of the property of deceasedpersons according to their wishes solemnly avowed beforedeath, or an equitable division in case of no suchavowal, the administration of the last rites to thedying, the regulation of burials, and the conformityof divine service in Ireland with that of the Churchof England ; while it is very remarkable, that, notwithstandingthe great reform which it was allegedthe Irish nation required, not only were all thebishops and ecclesiastics, who were present on thatoccasion, natives, with the exception of three, Henry simmediate chaplain and advisers, but it was actuallynot deemed necessary to make any canons at thissynod relative to religious doctrine, or even the moreLAURENCE (stole. 61essential points of discipline; and some of the decreesare evidently of a political rather than an ecclesiasticaltendency.About the year 1173, this prelate gave the amiableexample, not only of Christian forgiveness, butyet more of that cordiality, with which persons mostopposed in politics should concur in the cause of religionand charity, and co-operating with Strongbow,Robert Fits Stephen, and Raymond le Gros, undertookthe enlargement of Christ Church ; and, accordingly,at their own charges, erected the choir, thesteeple, and two chapels, one dedicated to St. Edmund,king and martyr, and to St. Mary ; and theother to St. Laud. He adhered, however, not theless faithfully to the fallen fortunes of his formersovereign, and as zealously, but more peaceably endeavouredto uphold them, as far as circumstanceswould now permit. Accordingly in 1175, whenRoderic O* Conor was reduced to narrow his negotiationsand exertions to the sole object of securingthe sovereignty of his own province of Connaught,he despatched Catholics, Archbishop of Tuam, theAbbot of St. Brandon, and Archbishop Laurence,(styled in the treaty, Roderic s chancellor,) to waitupon King Henry at Windsor, where he held hiscourt. There these emissaries concluded that remarkabletreaty, which is yet extant, and in whichthe contracting parties are both named kings, Henryof England, and Roderic of Connaught.* It was,Rymer s Foetlera ad ann.f)2 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.on this occasion, Archbishop O Toole visited theshrine of Thomas-becket at Canterbury ; and, asthe writer of his life says, narrowly escaped deathfrom an insane individual, who conceived he woulddo a meritorious action by murdering the prelate,and assimilating his fate with that of Becket. Accordingly,he rushed upon him as he was celebratingmass, beat him down, and inflicted grievous woundsupon his head. When the archbishop recovered, theking, on hearing of the circumstance, would havepunished the attempt by the death of the offender,but the archbishop interceded for his life, which wasspared accordingly.In 11 76, when the remains of Strongbow weredeposited in the church he had so lately beautifiedand enlarged, when "the proud invader" was letdown into the grave, amidst a population whose homeshe had desolated, Archbishop Laurence presided atthe solemn rites, that close the enmities of man andmingle, with the better recollections of the dead, thehopes and prayers that point to everlasting life ; yet,with what deep reflections must he have witnessedthe clay thrown over that cold corse, that was onceanimated with such an adventurous spirit, the narrowhome of him who was the prominent actor in thecatastrophe of a nation, whose successful ambition hadtriumphed over the independence of Ireland, subvertedits ancient constitution, dissolved the privilegesof its families, confined its monarch within a portionof the remotest province of his former kingdom, anderected out of the remainder, palatinates and baronies,LAURENCE O Tools. 63yet, in the words of William of Newbridge, " carriedto the grave no part of those spoils he coveted soeagerly in life, putting to risk even his eternal salvationto amass them ; but at last leaving to unthankfulheirs all he had acquired through so much toiland danger, affording, by his fate, a salutary lesson tomankind."In 1177 Cardinal Vivian presided as legate at acouncil in Dublin, where the right of the King ofEngland to the sovereignty of Ireland, in virtue ofthe Pope s authority, was further inculcated. Thereis no positive evidence, however, that ArchbishopLaurence took part in this proceeding, although heappears, in other transactions, conjointly with Vivianduring his stay in Ireland. In 1178 he granted andconfirmed to the church of the Holy Trinity, thoseof St. Michan, St. Michael, St. John the Evangelist,St. Brigid, St. Paul, and all the profits of the mills,which the said church was known to possess withoutthe walls near the bridge, and the fishery with thetithes of salmon and of all other fishes on eitherside of the water-course of the Liffey, and all thelands of Rather, Poitrane, Rathsillan, Kindly, thethird part of Cloghney, the third part of Killallin,Lillian, Silvester, Duncuanach, Glasnevin, MagnusSt. Dough s, Ballymacamleib, Cloncoen, Tillage,Tullaghcoen, Killingincleam, Kiltinan, Rathsal-raglan, Tullaghnaescope, Drumming, Ballyrochaican,half of Rathmihi, Thracian, Ballyrochan, and ,with all their appurtenances for ever.*Roll in Christ Church.(J4 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.Ill 1179 this archbishop, with some other Irishprelates, proceeded to Rome, to assist at the GeneralCouncil then held there, being the secondCouncil of Lateran. King Henry, however, beforehe would permit them to pass through his dominions,exacted from them a solemn oath, not to prejudicehim or his empire in the progress of their mission.On Laurence s arrival at Rome, he obtained a bullfrom the pope, confirming the dioceses of Glendalough,Kildare, Ferns, Leighlin, and Ossory, to his metro-politicalauthority, and further assuring to his ownsee its lands and possessions, as therein most fullydetailed. The Pope also created him legate of Ireland,in virtue of which commission, according to hisbiographers, he, afterwards, on his return, exercisedlegatine authority in his native country.In 1180, according to Hovered and Benedict,he again passed out of Ireland, entrusted by the unfortunateRoderic, to place that prince s son as anhostage with the English king, then sojourning inNormandy, as was stipulated in the before-mentionedtreaty of Windsor. There the archbishop was detainedby the king, whose displeasure he had incurred,as Cambrensis alleges, by having, through zeal forhis country s service, made some harsh representationsat Rome of the Anglo-Irish Government, and obtainedfrom the Pope privileges derogatory of theroyal dignity. But, as all history evinces that thispatriotic prelate discharged the duties of his highclerical station in the most exemplary manner, andeven yielded his political antipathies to the necessitiesLAURENCE o Tools. 65of the times, it may be naturally concluded, that hisremonstrances and authority were only such as justicewould warrant, and directed against the barbarity ofthe adventurers of the day. Such honest representations,of the encroachments they would have madein temporal and spiritual property, should be fairly consideredas so far from violating Laurence s engagementto Henry, that, in reality, the honest interest of theEnglish crown could not be better advanced, than bythe suppression of the wanton outrages he vainlywitnessed. It was by the disregard of his expostulationsthat a host of needy adventurers were endowedin Ireland, and a government founded within thepale of that devoted country, which was felt only inits power to do injustice. Well had it been, if theconsequences of that misrule had died with the tyrantswho first perpetrated it. Unfortunately, however,for the generations of ages, the acts of those detachedand licentious chiefs were permitted to assume thename of English administration, and bigotries wereengendered, and hatreds associated, which only thenineteenth century is dissolving.Archbishop Laurence lived to see his country thepatrimony of strangers ; but, to the last hour of hisexistence, he laboured to avert the evils of that dispensation,and to place a country, whose intestinedivisions made it incapable and unworthy of independence,under the lawful protection of England sKings, not the fickle despotism of alien Palatines.In the midst, however, of the ill-merited restraintsimposed upon him, it was too fatally evinced, thatCG ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.banishment from his country accelerated his dissolution.In Normandy the sickness fell upon him, and,conscious that the hour of his demise was approaching,he retired into the monastery of Regular Canons, atEu, on the confines of that province, anxious to closehis life within its peaceful walls, and amidst thebrethren of his favourite order. Yet, even in thesacred reflections of that moment, the afflictions ofhis country lived in his remembrance; from hisdeath bed, he is recorded as having sent a monk ofthe fraternity to the camp of Henry, to implorepeace" for Ireland ; and, when some token of assentwas given by the King, and communicated to theprelate, it mingled with the hopes of a dying Christian,and he sunk into his last repose on the 14th ofNovember, 1180. Immediately after his burial,which took place at Eu, King Henry despatchedGeoffrey de la Hay, his chaplain, into Ireland, toseize the revenues of the see, which he held over fornearly one year.The remains of Archbishop Laurence were, atfirst, placed in a shrine before the altar of the martyrLeodegarius ; but, when the prelate was canonized,in 1218, by Pope Honorius the Third, they were,with great solemnity, translated, and placed over thehigh altar, where they were long preserved in a silvershrine. The abbey, that was sanctified by his death,was, on his canonization, dedicated anew to him, andhis festival has continued to be celebrated thereyearly, with one office of nine lessons, as it is alsoobserved in Ireland, under the particular sanction ofST. LAURENCE o Tools. Cadecree of Pope Benedict the Fourteenth. " Cherishin your memory," says that pontiff, addressing thearchbishops and bishops of Ireland, " Cherish in yourmemory St. Patrick, the apostle of Ireland, whomour predecessor, St. Celestina, sent to you, of whoseapostolic mission and preaching, such an abundantharvest has grown, that Ireland, before his timeidolatrous, was suddenly called, and deservedly is,the Island of Saints ; cherish in your memory St.Malachy, Archbishop of Armagh, whose ardour forthe conversion of souls St. Bernard has depicted inthe boldest colouring. He stood forth undaunted, inevery manner prepared to convert the wolves intosheep, to admonish in public, to convince in private,to touch the chords of the heart boldly or gently,as suited the subject. Traversing the country, hesought the aspirations which he might turn to theservice of the true God ; neither was he carried byhorse, but on foot, like an apostle, he performed hismission. And yet, with even more sincerity, cherishin your memory St. Laurence, the Archbishop of Dublin,whom, born as he was of royal blood, our predecessor,Alexander the Third, in the Council of Lateran,selected as his legate apostolic for Ireland, and whomHonorius the Third, alike our predecessor, afterwardscanonized; whence you may well know what servicesthat saintly man rendered to his flock. But if yetmore we were to exhort you to cherish in your memorythe very holy men, Columbus, Lilian, Virgil,Rumold, St. Gall, and the many others who, comingout of Ireland, carried the true faith over the provincesF 2(jg ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.of the continent, or established it with the blood oftheir martyrdom, we should far exceed the limits of aletter. Suffice it to commend to you, to bear inmemory the religion and the piety of those that havepreceded you, and the solicitude for the duties oftheir station, which has established their everlastingglory and happiness"*In reference to his personal appearance, St. Laurenceis represented as having been tall, and gracefulin stature, of a comely presence, and, in his outwardhabit, grave but rich. His life, published by Surius,is said to have been written by Ralph of Bristol,Bishop of Kildare, in the commencement of thethirteenth century ; and a correct copy thereof is reportedto be in Archbishop Ussher s collection, inTrinity College, Dublin. The biography, fromwhich the chief facts above related have been selected,was written by a brother of the monastery of Eu, andis published in Walsingham s Florilegium. It butremains to mention, that, in the Roman Catholicchurch, St. Laurence is the patron saint of the dioceseof DublinJOHN COMYN.[Sue. 1181.

Accordingly, on themonarch s urgent recommendation, his chaplain, JohnComyn, a native of England, a monk of the Benedictineabbey of Evesham, and a man of learning andeloquence, was, on the 6th of September, in the year1181, elected to the archbishopric of Dublin, by someof the clergy of that city, who had assembled atEvesham for the purpose. He was not then a priest,but was subsequently, in the same year, ordainedsuch, at Velletri; and, on Palm Sunday (21st March)was there consecrated archbishop by Pope Lucius theThird, who, also, by a bull dated the 13th of April,1182, took under his especial protection, and confirmedto this see, the manor of Swords, with itschurch and other appurtenances, the town of Lusk,with its church and appurtenances, c. He alsofurther established its metropolitan authority over thesuffragan sees, ordered that no canons or monks, orclergymen in any of the churches of the diocese,should remove or appoint chaplains therein, unlessfortified in so doing by privilege from Rome, or byancient and reasonable custom, prohibited the selling,altering, or incumbering church property, withoutthe consent of the archbishop, or any similar acts bythe archbishop himself; and, lastly, in pursuance ofthe authority of the Holy Canons, ordered and densARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.creed that no archbishop, or bishop, should, withoutthe assent of the archbishop of Dublin, (if in hisbishopric,) presume to hold, within the diocese ofDublin, any conference, or to entertain any causes orecclesiastical matters of the same diocese, unless enjoinedthereto by the Roman pontiff, or his legate.*From this latter privilege, which appears to have beenintroduced as against the antiquated claims of Canterbury,arose that controversy on the Jus Primitivebetween the archbishops of Armagh and Dublin,which continued to distract both provinces for centuriesafterwards, the archbishop of Armagh contending,that, notwithstanding this grant, he had a rightof primacy, of bearing up the cross, and of holdingappeals and visitations in the whole province ofLeinster. Cambrensis, who was personally acquaintedwith Archbishop Comyn, asserts, that at the said timeof his consecration, he was created a cardinal ; but, asthere is no assumption of this title in any of Comyn scharters yet extant, nor any evidence thereof inOnuphrius or Ciaconius, who have published cataloguesof the cardinals, nor in the very bull of PopeLucius before mentioned, Ware very reasonablyconcludes, that Giraldus was mistaken in this particular.Notwithstanding the necessities of the provinceover which he was thus appointed to preside, and thesingularly arduous duties he had to prosecute, if theEnglish representations of the state of Ireland couldbe fully accredited, Comyn deferred visiting thatAlan Resist. f. 2. Ware and Harris completely mistake themeaning of the originalJOHN COMYN. 71country for three whole years, until at last, in September,1184, he was despatched thither by the king,to prepare for the reception of Prince John, Earl ofMoreton, whom his royal father had resolved to sendinto this country. It was, upon this occasion, accordingto some,* that the king conferred upon Commandhis successors, the lands of Coillagh and its appurtenances,in barony tenure, in which right hebecame a lord of parliament, and was the first of theIrish hierarchy invested with those feudal and baronialrights, which the Norman policy had introduced, asparticularly mentioned at " Swords," in the " Historyof the County of Dublin. " In 1185, he wasone of the English nobles, who, as pre-arranged, receivedJohn and his train on his arrival at Waterford ;and in the same year obtained from the boy prince,during his sojourn in Ireland, a grant of the Bishopricof Glendalough, with all its appurtenances in lands,manors, churches, tithes, fisheries, liberties, c., tohold to him and his successors for ever.f This grantPrince John professes to make under the impulse ofdivine love, and for the safety of his soul, and that ofhis father and all his ancestors and successors, and inconsiderationof the thinness of the population andthe poverty of the church of Dublin. It was provided,however, that this union should not take effectuntil after the decease of the then Bishop of Glenclough, William Piro, an event which did not occur-until the year 1214, when Comyn was himself in thegrave.Liber Niger and Crede Mihi. f Ib.72 AliCIIUISHOI H OF Dublin.In the year 1 180, after the return of Prince Johninto England, Archbishop Comyn held a provincialsynod in Dublin, in the church of the Holy Trinity,which began to sit on the Sunday Stare Jerusalem,or the fourth Sunday of Lent. The canons thereagreed to, and confirmed under the leaden weal ofPope Urban the Third, are yet extant among thearchives preserved in Christ Church, Dublin, arid arcas follow : The first prohibits priests from celebratingmass on a wooden table (or altar) according tothe usage of Ireland, arid enjoins that in all monasteriesarid baptismal churches altars should be madeof stone ; and, if a stone of sufficient size to cover thewhole surface of the altar could not be bad, that insuch case a square, entire and polished stone be fixedin the middle of the altar, where Christ s body isconsecrated, of a compass broad enough to contain.five crosses, and also to bear the foot of the largestchalice. Hut in chapels, chantries, or oratories, ifnecessity compelled the use of wooden altars, thatthen the mass should be celebrated upon plates ofstone of the before-mentioned size, firmly fixed inthe wood. Second provides, that the coverings ofthe holy mysteries shall spread over the whole upperpart of the altar, and that a cloth shall coverthe front of the same, arid reach to the ground orfloor. These coverings to be always whole andclean. Third, that in monasteries and rich churches,chalices be provided of gold and silver; but in poorerchurches, where such cannot be afforded, that pewterchalices may be substituted, which must be likewiseJOHN I Omen. 73kept pure and clean. Fourth, that the Host whichrepresents the Lamb without spot, the Alpha andOmega, be made so white and pure, that the partakersthereof may thereby understand the purifyingand feeding of their souls rather than their bodies.Fifth, that the wine in the sacrament be so temperedwith water, that it lee not deprived either of the naturaltaste or colour. Sixth, that all vestments andcoverings belonging to the church be clean, line, andwhite. Seventh, that a lavatory of stone or wood besetup, and so contrived with a hollow, that whateveris poured into it may fall through and lodge in theearth ; through which, also, the last washing of thepriest s hands after the holy communion may passesenjoins, that an immoveable font be placedin the middle of every baptismal church, or in suchother part of it as the paschal procession may convenientlypass round. That it be made of stone, or ofwood lined with lead for cleanness, wide and largeabove, bored through to the bottom, and so contrived,that, after the ceremony of baptism be ended, the holywater may by a secret pipe be conveyed down tomother earth. Ninth, that the coverings of the altar,and other vestments dedicated to God, when injuredby age, be burned within the enclosure of the church,and the ashes transmitted through the aforesaid pipeof the font, to be buried in the bowels of the earth.Tenth prohibits any vessels used in baptism, frombeing applied ever after to any domestic purposes.Eleventh forbids, under the pain of an anathema, anyperson from burying in a churchyard, unless he can74 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.show by an authentic writing, or undeniable evidence,that it was consecrated by a bishop, not only as asanctuary or place of refuge, but also as a place ofsepulture ; and that no laymen shall presume to burytheir dead in such a consecrated place, without thepresence of a priest. Twelfth forbids the celebrationof divine service in chapels built by laymen, to thedetriment of the mother churches. Thirteenth recites,that the clergy of Ireland , among other virtues,have been always remarkably eminent for their chastity,and that it would be ignominious if they shouldbe corrupted, through his (the archbishop s) negligence,by the foul contagion of strangers, and theexample of a few incontinent men ; and, therefore,prohibits, under the penalty of losing both office andbenefice, any priest, deacon, or sub-deacon, fromhaving or retaining any woman in their houses, eitherunder the pretence of necessary service, or any othercolour whatsoever, unless a mother, own sister, orsuch a person, whose age should remove all suspicionof any unlawful commerce Fourteenth contains aninterdict against simony, under the before-mentionedpenalty of losing both office and benefice. Fifteenthdirects, that if any clerk should receive an ecclesiasticalbenefice from a lay hand, unless after a thirdmonition he renounce that possession which he obtainedby intrusion, he should be anathematized, andfor ever deprived of the said benefice. Sixteenthprohibits a bishop from ordaining the inhabitant ofanother diocese without the commendatory letters ofsuch person s, proper bishop, or of the archdeacon,JOHN Commandorders that none shall be promoted to holy orders,without a certain title of a benefice assignedto him.

Twentiethprovides, that all archers, and all others whocarry arms, not for the defence of the people but forplunder and sordid lucre, shall, on every Lord s daybe excommunicated with bell, book, and candle, and,in the last extremity, be denied the rites of Christianburial.On the 3rd of September, 1189, ArchbishopComyn assisted at the coronation of King Richardthe First, and was a witness of that monarch s letterspatent* for surrendering to William, King of Scotland,the castles of Rockbork and Berwick, therebyacknowledged to belong to the Scottish king by he-rymers Fceclera ad ann.76 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.hereditary right. He also, on the 17th of Septemberfollowing, assisted at a council of the nobility andgentry, which the same monarch, previous to his departurefor the Holy Land, assembled in the Abbeyof Pipewell in Northamptonshire, on which occasion,the regency of the kingdom, during the monarch sabsence, was arranged. There, likewise, on the ensuingday, Comyn consecrated John, Bishop elect ofWhither.In the following year, this prelate, having takendown an old parochial church which was said to havebeen founded by St. Patrick, in the southern suburbsof the city of Dublin, erected on its site the fairedifice, which was also dedicated to that saint, elevatedit to the rank of a collegiate establishment, andendowed it with suitable possessions, placing in itthirteen prebendaries, afterwards augmented to thepresent number. He also, about the same time,partly repaired and partly enlarged the choir of thecathedral of Christ Church, and founded and endowedthe nunnery of Grace Dieu in the County ofDublin, for regular canonesses of the order of St.Augustine, whom he removed thither from the moreancient convent of Lusk.Early in the year 1191 John Earl of Moreton,as Lord of Ireland, confirmed to this prelate and hissuccessors, all liberties theretofore granted to his see,with the extraordinary additional licence, that heand they might hold a court throughout the landof Ireland, and administer justice to their ownpeople, as well within as without this diocese. Har-johnCOMYN. 77ris doubts the authenticity of the instrument, onthe ground, that at the time, to which he refers it,(1184,) John had no power to give such an extentof authority; the grant, however, from the namesof the witnesses and other internal evidence, iscorrectly referable to the above year, when John sassumption of power was more probable, in the absenceof King Richard at the siege of Acre, andthe charter is undoubtedly preserved amongst themost ancient documents of the See in Christ Church.About the same time, Maoris, on being raised to theSee of Clogher, surrendered to this prelate and hissuccessors his claim to the church of All Hallowsnear Dublin, reserving it, however, to himself turin*his life, to be held of the said archbishop and of thechurch of the Holy Trinity.In 1 1 92 Prince John gave this prelate an additionalmark of his favour, confirming to him and his successorsfor ever the previous grant of the bishopric ofGlendalough, "so that upon its vacancy the archbishopshould hold it without rendering any account to thecrown therefore, and should provide for it according tohis discretion, and that, in the mean time, the bishopelect should be his chaplain and vicegerent ;" thecharter of which grant was, thereupon, confirmed bythe apostolic legate, Matthew O Henry, Archbishopof Cashel, at a great synod held in Dublin. Comynhad at the same time a royal grant for an eight dayfair, to be held in his town of Swords, with all customsto the same justly appertaining ; and, in theexercise of his worldly prudence, still farther fortisARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.find the rights of his see by a confirmation of itspossessions, both spiritual and temporal, from Eva,the daughter and heiress of Dermot Mac Furlough,while in 1193 he obtained from Pope Celestina theThird a further assurance of the see of Glendalough,according to the above arrangement of the legate.In 1197 this prelate was much harassed anddespoiled by Hame de Valois, alias de Valois,who, being appointed Justiciary of Ireland underPrince John, and finding the government embarrassedby the want of a treasury, seized on severallands belonging to this see notwithstanding the oppositionof the archbishop. Representations of theseand other wilful and unauthorised spoliations by deValois having been made at Rome, and Comynhaving felt himself obliged to fly to France, PopeInnocent the Third wrote a remonstrance to John,dated 18th September, 1198, in which he complainedof the unjust and outrageous conduct of the Deputy,and also of John himself, for having detained thearchbishop in Normandy. Hame was thereupon recalledfrom the government, having greatly enrichedhimself by the plunder of not only the church, butthe laity. It is recorded, however, that he soon feltremorse for his crimes towards Comyn, and, in partcompensation therefore, made a grant of twentyploughman to the archbishop and his successors forever.But the resentment which John conceived, byreason of the appeal to Rome, was more inflexiblycherished, and not until 1206, does he seem to havereceived the prelate to his favour, as is testified byHENRY DE Londres. 79a record of that year, preserved in the Chapter-houseof Westminster, wherein the king, after reciting thathe had given up his " anger and indignation" againstthe Archbishop of Dublin, and received him intofull favour, commands the Lord Justice of Ireland toprotect him from any injury, and to restore to himthe lands and liberties which he enjoyed, " on theday when the discord first commenced between usand him, concerning our foresters and others ourservants."Comyn survived this reconciliation about sixyears, and, dying on the 25th of October, in theyear 1212, was buried in Christ Church, where amarble monument was erected to his memory, in thesouth side of the choir which he had repaired andenlarged.HENRY DE Londres.[Succ. 1213. Ob. 1228.]Before the close of the year 1212 Henry of London,Archdeacon of Stafford, was elected into thisarchiepiscopal see, and, about the beginning of theyear following, was consecrated. The appointmentdid not, however, immediately or permanently removehim from England, and he is found a sitting memberof King John s council, a spiritual baron of therealm, in the most important transactions of thatreign. In the year 1213, when that monarchexecuted his charter of surrender of the crowns ofEngland and Ireland to Randolph, the Pope s legate,80 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.de Loundres was present, but protested against thedeed, and, it might seem, refused to subscribe it as awitness. It accordingly concludes, " Teste rage,coram Henries Archiepiscopal Dubliniensi et alias."Soon after which he was sent to conduct StephenLangton, Archbishop of Canterbury, and the rest ofthe exiled bishops, to the King s presence.* In theJuly of the same year, he was appointed Lord Justice ofIreland, in the administration of which office he continueduntil the year 1215, while, in the intermediateyear, (1214,) his sovereign confirmed to him thearchiepiscopal lands, and particularly those of Coillaghwith its appurtenances, which, as the charter roll, ofrecord in the Tower of London, states, had been previouslygranted "in baroniae," with, however, theespecial reservation, that the King, on his going intoIreland, might resume these lands, on assigning othersin a peaceable and convenient situation to the see.In the same year, upon the death of William Piro,the last legally recognised Bishop of Glendalough,that see, which had existed separate for about 600years, was virtually united and annexed to the dioceseof Dublin, as before mentioned in the preliminaryaccount of its constitution ; but, although this arrangementwas established as well by popes as bykings, many distinct individuals! will be found in theRot. claus. 15 John.t At some future period, the memoirs of these persons, their see, andthe lovely and interesting country of their jurisdiction maybe publishedby the author of this work.

On his arrival in Rome,Pope Innocent the Third ratified the aforesaid unionof Glendalough with Dublin, and, in 1216, confirmedthe possessions of the see, enumerating them as thechurches of St. Patrick in Dublin, Saints Peterand Paul in Glendalough, Monecolumbkill, Kennel,Inisboiden, St. Brigid near Arklow, with all theirappurtenances ; the advowsons of the monasteries of82 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.All Hallows without the city of Dublin, Holm-patrick,the hospital of St. John of Jerusalem withoutthe New Gate, and the advowsons of the churchesof the Salmon-Leap, Coffee, Moon, and of thetown of Robert Bedside ; all parish churches withinthe walls and in the suburbs of the said city, and allother churches which are in the valley of Dublinwith their appurtenances ; the houses and buildings atSt. Sepulchre with their burgage and appurtenances;the manors of St. Kevin, Swords, Lusk, Clonme-than, Portrait, Finglas, Clondalkin, Rathcoole, withthe Newtown, Tallagh, Kilnasantan, Taney, Carmichael,Stagonil, Killadreene, Kilcoole, GlendaleBallymore, the holy wood of Coillagh, ,Tipperkevin, Robber, Dunlavan,Donald, and Kilbele, Dunboke, Rathsallaghan,Donanamore, Strabo, Arterial, Crothekevin, Shan-kill,Killmakebur, Frederic, Adkip, and Profane,with the appurtenances of the same ; the islands ofLambay, Ireland s Eye, Dalkey, and a knight s feein Howth. He also confirmed the suffragan sees ofthis province, as Ossory, Leighlin, Ferns, and Kildare,with all the rights and privileges of the pell, and interdictedany other archbishop or bishop from holdingconferences, or entertaining causes in the diocese ofDublin, in nearly the same terms as Pope Lucius haddone in favour of his predecessor in 1182.In the same year, (1216,) Archbishop de Loundreshad a grant to him and his successors* from KingHarris s Ware, p. 300.HENRY DK Londres. 83John, of the manor of Pcnkeriz, with the villages ofCongreve, Culega, Wuolgareston, and Beffecote, theland of the Dunn, the fair of the village of Penkeriz,and the deanery of the church of St. Mary of Penkeriz, in the diocese of Coventry and Litchfield ; andthe king also conferred upon him and his successorsthe lordship or manor of Timothan. These grantsbeing avowedly made in part satisfaction of the deepobligations which the monarch owed to de Loundres,for undertaking to build the Castle of Dublin, assome say, at his own expense, his other charges inthe King s service, while he was Lord Justice, hisattendance at the court of Rome to solicit aid againstthe barons, and the singular additional item of hishaving " promptly bought up as much scarlet clothas would serve to make robes for the King of Irelandand other his (John s) liege subjects there, when hereceived instructions to that effect, by writ of the23rd of August, 1215."* " Probably," says Leland,commenting on the latter circumstance, " these robeswere made after the English mode. If so, it was byno means a contemptible device to endeavour to habituatethose chiefs to the English garb, and by theirexample to render it fashionable in their territories.The gentler and less offensive method of introducingan advantageous change of apparel, gradually and imperceptibly,under the appearance of grace and favour,had it been pursued with steadiness and address,might have proved more effectual than the penal lawsRymer s Fcedera ad arm.G2$4 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.of later times, which, by an avowed and violent oppositionto the manners of the Irish, proved too odious tobe exec cited." From the period of those grants, eachsucceeding archbishop of Dublin assumed the title,as recorded in the Liber Niger. " N. moderationdivini, ecclesiae cathedrals sanctissimas Trinitariansregulars abbas, et sancti Patricii episcopus, etsedes apostolical gratia archiepiscopal ac Hibernensisecclesiae primae, liberseque capellae regis SanctaMarias de Penkeriz in Anglia tetanus natus, princepsPalatines de Harold s Cross, coepiscopatuumque serioussuffraganeorum acanthus custos, spiritualitatisjurisdictions atque omnium decimarum in eadem provincia,custos." The advowson of this church ofPenkeriz, it is here to be observed, was originallyconferred by King Stephen on the church of Lichfield; but, being endowed with lands, and madecollegiate by a person named Hugh Hussy, thatindividual gave it to King John, who, thereupon,made the above disposition of it to de Loundres.This establishment consisted of a dean, eight prebendaries,two residentiary canons without prebends, asacristy, who was a canon, and the dean s vicar, andhad the benefit of mortuaries and other casualties.One of those prebends, it appears by a taxation recitedby Plot, was called the Dean s Prebend, whichprobably was annexed to the dignity of the dean, afterthe constitution of this church was again altered froma collegiate into that of a dean and chapter. Thereare various records, some of which are alluded tohereafter, recognising the rights of the see of DublinHENRY DE Londres. 85herein, even down to the eighteenth century, whenit passed into other hands.In 1217? the Pope having constituted this prelatehis legate in Ireland, he convened a synod at Dublin,wherein," according to the Annals of St. Mary sAbbey, " he established many things profitable forthe state of the Irish church." Its canons are extantin the ancient Register of Christ Church, calledCrede Mihi." About the same time, or a shorttime previously, de Loundres annexed to the economyof St. Patrick s, the tithes of the lands of thecitizens of Dublin near Donnybrook, half a burgagenear St. Kevin s gate, a mill near Dunore, and thechurch of Monecolumbkill, with its appendant chapels.In 1219 5 Jeffrey de Mariscis having been recalledfrom the government of Ireland, this prelate againassumed its administration, which he continued to exerciseuntil the year 1224. In 1220 he is said tohave put out the fire called inextinguishable, whichappears to have been kindled by St. Brigid at Kildare,possibly to allure the gentiles of her day by the presenceof their revered element, solemnly mingledwith the uses of a pure spiritual worship, and whichCambrensis alleges was kept up by the successivenuns of her establishment. In the same year, deLoundres removed the religious fraternity of Holm-patrickto the more convenient foundation at Skerries.In 1221 Pope Honorius further prohibited anyarchbishop or bishop from holding conferences ortrials in the province of Dublin, or erecting the cropARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.tier therein, excepting, however, the archbishop ssuffragans, and any authorized legate of the Pope.In the following year, this prelate gave to the cathedralof St. Patrick, and to the church of the HolyTrinity, a yearly pension of 105. each, being theamount which the citizens of Dublin were adjudgedto pay, as compensation for having enclosed and tilleda parcel of ground belonging to him, and to the useof which his grace s tenants of St. Sepulchre s and St.Kevin s were entitled as a common of pasture.* Soonafterwards, however, his own encroachments on therights of the crowns in behalf of the church, andhis drawing temporal causes into the ecclesiasticalcourts, excited considerable prejudice against him.The citizens of Dublin particularly complained ofsuch his practices, and, in consequence of their representations,the king issued a mandate peremptorilyprohibiting any recurrence of such injustice, andthe prelate was obliged to conclude an agreementwith the citizens in reference to the matter, which isof record and dated the 18th of March, 1224. Inthe same year, the abbot and fraternity of Tewkesbury,to whose house Prince John granted the landsof Hungarian in the diocese of Lismore, sold sameto this prelate in consideration of 24, the estatebeing declared to be utterly unprofitable and wastein their hands.In 1225 (according to Prynne) Pope HonoriusCrede Mihi. t Rot. Claus. 7 HentSee Prynne, V. 3, 63, &c.HENRY DP: Londres.sent a Bull to de Loundres, giving him authority tosummon all such as detained the king s castles in Ireland,and if, on investigation, the fact should be establishedagainst any, then to compel the delinquents,unless otherwise acquiescent, to surrender same underpain of ecclesiastical censures for their disobedience.In the same year, this prelate granted the church ofMore to the economy of St. Patrick s, and concludedanother agreement with the citizens of Dublin, wherebyhis tenants were to enjoy the freedom and privilegesof the city ; they covenanting to contribute,besides the ordinary local charges, their just proportionof any talliage or aid granted at the specialmandate of the king.* In 1227 a taxation was madeof the dignities of St. Patrick s cathedral, with theobject of levying, from each non-resident prebendary,one-fifth of the revenue of the prebend for the useof the working clergy.

Onthe 10th of May in the same year, the king issuedanother writs to Richard de Burgo, Lord Justice ofIreland, the said Bishop of Ferns, and Archdeacon ofDublin, empowering them to audit the accounts concerningthe money raised out of the vacant sees inpursuance of the above, to credit the king for whatthe archbishop received thereout, and to certifyhow much was paid, and how much remained due ;while a further royal writ assigned one hundredRot.

III.HENRY DE Londres. 89pounds out of the farm rents of the city of Limerick ,and fifty marks annually out of the farm of the cityof Dublin, as an additional fund for liquidating thesaid demands.During the time this archbishop presided overthe see and province of Dublin, he erected thecollegiate church of St. Patrick into a cathedral,united," as Allen says in his Registry, " withthe cathedral of the Holy Trinity in one spouse,saving to the other church the prerogative of honour."He constituted William Fits Guy the first deanthereof, and appointed a precentor, chancellor, andtreasurer, to whom he allotted lands and rectories.He granted thirteen days indulgence to penitentsvisiting the abbey of Glastonbury* in England ; and,some short time before his death, gave to the priorand convent of Christ Church a piece of ground, forwhich Gilbert Comyn paid him the annual rent ofthree marks, in order to facilitate the erection of agatehouse at the entrance of their church, and inconsiderationof their having granted to him a perpetualanniversary, to be observed in their convent,to his memory. The original instrument of this agreement,with the seal of de Loundres annexed, is amongthe archives of Christ Church. Having filled thissee during fifteen years, he died about the beginningof July, in the year 1228, and is said to have beenburied under a wooden monument near the northwall of Christ Church, opposite to his predecessor,Chron. Last. Hearnc, V. ii. p. 384.()0 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.Corny n. There are now, however, no traces of histomb.The circumstances under which he obtained theopprobrious epithet of " Scorch-villain," as related inthe " Liber Niger" or Black Book of Christ Church,are heavily reproachful to his memory. Havingsummoned his tenants to give an account by whattitle they held their lands, they appeared and producedtheir deeds, of which he instantly possessedhimself, and threw them into the fire, to the prejudiceof the unsuspicious farmers. If the transaction reallyoccurred, it is no less discreditable to the character ofthe archbishop than to the government of the countryat the time; and it must be admitted that variousother circumstances in the life of this prelate, asalluded to in the above memoir, evincing an avidityto enlarge the rights and possessions of his church,induce too much credence to the probability of hisassuming this strange and unjustifiable mode of discontinuinginterests, which were possibly unjust andfraudulent in their creation.LUKE.[Succ. 1228, Ob. 1255.]Upon the death of Archbishop Henry, Luke,Dean of St. Martin le Grand, London, and treasurerof the King s wardrobe, was, by the interest ofHubert de Burgh, Earl of Kent, whose chaplain hehad been, elected to this see, and obtained the royalconfirmation thereof, on the 13th of December, 1228.LUKE. 91But this election having been set aside at Rome asnot canonical, he was re-elected, and thereupon,though not until the year 1230, confirmed by PopeGregory the Ninth s bull, sub plumbs, which is yetextant in the chapter house of Christ Church, Dublin.The charges of these elections, and the expenses ofsoliciting the several confirmations of his appointment,were probably the occasion of his disafforesting adistrict belonging to his see,* for which he was, inthe year 1230, called to account, and fined 300marks ; yet, in the same year, he obtained the King slicence for disafforesting another tract within the demesnesof the bishopric of Glendalough, and comprehendinga considerable portion of the county ofWicklow. He had, likewise, about the same time,a confirmation to him and his successors of all thepossessions theretofore granted to the see, and a distinctratification! of its rights in Timothan, nearTallagh, which had been theretofore given by KingJohn to de Loundres ; but it was not established as aprebend until 1247.In 1232. when his patron, Hubert de Burgh,Earl of Kent, had fallen under the King s displeasure,and was cruelly prosecuted by the court, and desertedby all his friends, Archbishop Luke, to his greatcredit, adhered unchangeably to his interest, and, byhis individual perseverance, succeeded in prevailingon his sovereign to indulge him with milder termsthan were originally intended.Rot. Pat. 14 Hon. II f. t Allen s Registry.92 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.In the following year the king, by special grant,empowered this archbishop and his successors to makea testamentary distribution of their chattels at anyperiod before their respective deaths; and, on the26th of September, in 1234, restored to him thetown of Stagonil with its appurtenances, and allliberties and free customs thereto appertaining. In1235 Archbishop Luke founded a chantry in thechapel of the Blessed Virgin, at St. Patrick s cathedral;* and, about the year 1237, confirmed theliberties and privileges granted by his predecessor toits dean and chapters He also improved the buildingsof Christ Church, and endowed that of St.John, without the New Gate, with two burgageand six acres of land in St. Kevin s parish. In1240 he granted to the vicars serving mass at thealtar of the Blessed Virgin, in St. Patrick s cathedral,a certain portion of the revenues of the church ofAlderg,J as shewn at that locality, in the " History ofthe County of Dublin;" and, in 1242, assigned, forthe further maintenance of said vicars, one-third partof an impost, which, with the consent of the dean andchapter, he had laid on the dignitaries and canons, inorder thereby to raise a sum for the benefit of thecommon fund, and which every new member of thechapter was required to pay, before he obtained possessionof the manse of his predecessor. In 1247? atthe instance of the said dean and chapter, he made anact for the purpose of enforcing the residence of theLiber Niger. t Sign. Dec. } Allen s Registry.LUKE. 93prebendaries of St. Patrick s cathedral, prescribingthat every canon should, within a year after his appointment,repair in person to that church, andswear canonical obedience to the archbishop, his successors,and to the chapter of St. Patrick s, and shouldalso bind himself to observe the customs and approvedrules of the church, which, if he failed to do, he wasto be deprived of his prebend, his institution andinstalment were to be void, and the prebend thusvacated might be conferred on whomsoever thearchbishop would think fit.* In the following year,with the consent of the Baron of Offal, he made thechurch of Larabrien a prebend of the same cathedral,the perpetual right of presentation being reserved tothe baron and his heirs.About the year 1250 the archbishops, bishops,and clergy of Ireland, who were of Irish birth, havingin a synod enacted a decree, that no Englishmanborn should be admitted a canon in any of theirchurches, King Henry complained thereof to thePope, who directed a bull to them, dated the 8th ofOctober in that year, commanding them to rescindthe said decree within a month, and a special one toArchbishop Luke, and to Jeffrey Orville, Bishop ofOssory, empowering them, if the other prelates didnot obey, to declare by his authority such restrictionnull and void. The same Pope, on the 1 th of July,1252, took under his special protection the churchesof this diocese, saving the archiepiscopal rights ofAllen s Registry.<)4 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.advowson, &c. therein, which he further confirmedto the see by another bull of the 23rd of October,1254.In 1253 a great contest arose between the twocathedrals of Dublin, concerning the election of thesuccessive archbishops upon vacancies,* which ArchbishopLuke would have settled by prescribing thatthe place of election should be only in the church ofthe Holy Trinity, and that there, as well the priorand convent as the dean and chapter, should, by jointsuffrages, elect the new prelate. But the dean andchapter of St. Patrick s were not content with thisadjustment, and complained of it to Innocent theFourth, as a special injustice to them. That Popethereupon issued his bull, dated the 20th of May, inthe tenth year of his pontificate, and still preservedin the archives of Christ Church, whereby he empoweredthe Bishop of Emly, and the Bishop andDean of Limerick, to determine the controversy ;and, if that could not be done, to remit it for the decisionof the apostolic see. About the same timethe contest concerning the primacy was warmly carriedon between this prelate and Reiner, Archbishopof Armagh.During the latter years of his life, ArchbishopLuke suffered severely by a malady of the eyes,which brought on a total loss of sight, and, ultimately,accelerated his decease, in December, 1255. He wasburied in Christ Church, in the same tomb with hispredecessor Comyn.Liber Niger.Full DE SAUNDFORD. (j5Full DE SAUNDFORD.[Succ. 1256. Ob. 1271.]After the death of Archbishop Luke, Ralph ofNorwich, Canon of St. Patrick s, Dublin, and Treasurerof Ireland, was elected to this see by both chapters; but, as Matthew Paris states, he was betrayedm the Court of Rome by those in whom he confided,and by that means lost the accomplishment of his expectations.Matthew, in his sketch of Ralph s character,suggests some circumstances which may havevery reasonably prevented the Pope from ratifyinghis election. He was a witty, pleasant companion,"says the historian, " and one who loved good cheer.In his youth he had the greater part of his educationrather in the king s court, than in the schools wherethe liberal arts were taught. He was elected by thecanons Archbishop of Dublin, but being opposed bysome, his confirmation was put off, and the electorswere reproved for choosing a man altogether secularand worldly, one then under the protection and powerof the king, and placed at the receipt of custom inIreland." This election being thereupon set aside,Fulk de Sandford, so called from the place of hisbirth in Oxfordshire, Archdeacon of Middlesex, andTreasurer of St. Paul s, London, was, on the 20thof July, 1256, by the Pope s Bull* declared Archbishop,with licence to hold his said treasurership incommendam, and all other prebends and ecclesiasticalCrede Mihi.QQ ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.benefices which he held before his promotion, notwithstandingthe constitutions of any general council,and, on the 12th of August in the same year, PopeAlexander the Fourth issued his bull for further andbetter protection of this prelate s right of collation tothe livings of his patronage. In the following year,the same pontiff empowered him to choose any discreetpriest for his confessor, and, by licence of the27th of July, 1257, authorized him to unite certainreligious houses of the Benedictine and Augustineorder, on account of their extreme poverty. In thefollowing year he had leave to rescind and avoidseveral leases and grants of houses, tithes, rents, lands,and possessions, made by his predecessors (it wouldseem improvidently) to the Cistercians, Templar,Hospitallers, and to the religious of other orders, aswell as to secular clerks and lacs, though the consentof both chapters and the confirmation of the ApostolicSee are stated to have been given to the grants.The circumstance is confirmatory of the constructionput upon the act of his predecessor, in reference tothe leases of some of the tenants of the see. On the4th of November, 1259, the Pope, by Bull recitingthe before-mentioned grant in 1216 of the deaneryof St. Michael of Penkeriz in the diocese of Coventryto Henry de Loundres, that same had been confirmedby the Holy See, and the said deanery and the prebendsappertaining to its collation so held and filledby this prelate and his predecessors for upwards ofthirty years, that there were no profits or emolumentsannexed to said deanery, and only the patronage ofFull DE SAUNDFORD. 97the prebends, solemnly united it to the church ofDublin for ever, and appointed that the Archbishopof Dublin and his successors should in their ownpersons enjoy the same.In 1260 a question, as to the limits of the parishesof the Dublin see contiguous to Baltinglas, havingarisen between this prelate and the fraternity of theCistercian abbey there, was decided by Bull of the20th of April in that year, as was a more seriousclaim of tithes payable by the archbishop to the deanand chapter " of the church of Dublin." In thefollowing year, de Sandford took a journey to Romeon business relative to his see, the management ofwhich during his absence was committed by the Popeto the care of the Bishops of Lismore and Waterford.*On this occasion, he obtained from Urban aBull, whereby, after reciting that it was long accustomedin the province of Dublin, that its archbishop,his suffragans, officers, and other ecclesiastical j edges,should have cognizance of contracts and agreementsratified by faithful promises or oaths, of complaintsof defamation, and of injuries done to clerks by laymen,but that recently the king s justiciaries impededthem in the exercise of these rights, protectedthe convicted offenders against ecclesiastical sentences,not only in these cases, but in questions of usury,adultery, and divorce, and prevented the due executionof bequests for pious purposes ; such illegalinterferences were solemnly prohibited for the futureCrede Mihi.HQ3 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.under pain of excommunication, or other ecclesiasticalcensures. While on the other hand, a Bull ofthe same year confirmed the rights of the primacyin the Archbishop of Armagh, and gave " licence tohim and his successors to bear before him the cross,which is the standard of Christ, through all the provincesand bishoprics subject to him, by metropolitanand primatial right, as it is well known wasgranted to his predecessors."In 1262 the same Pope issued two Bulls to protectthis prelate in the right of visitation of certainchurches and chapels, which the Prior of St.John of Jerusalem sought to exempt from his jurisdiction.The archbishop subsequently passed intoEngland, where he remained until 1265, when KingHenry, after the defeat of de Montfort and the otherbarons at the battle of Evesham, sent him back, togetherwith the Bishop of Meath, Lords William deBurgo, and Maurice Fits Maurice Fits Gerald, alsothen sojourning in England, as commissioners, withspecial authority to appease the dissensions that existedbetween the nobles and magnates of Ireland.In 1266 the king appears on record, grantingto " Robert le Proved, Bishop of Dublin, his heirs,and their tenants," that their goods should not bedistrained in any place for debts, wherein they werenot principals or sureties, unless where the debtorswere within their power, and that the said Robert orhis heirs were deficient in doing justice to the creditors.This Robert, however, though styled Bishopof Dublin, was clearly but a coadjutor to Fulk, whoseFull DE SAUNDFORD. 99name occurs in contemporaneous and subsequent recordsas archbishop of that province.The before-mentioned bull of 1261 it appears,had not the effect of controlling, at least as fully aswas expected by de Sandford, the encroachments ofthe citizens on the ecclesiastical courts and privileges.At this time the revenues and support of the churchesof the diocese consisted, for the most part, in theofferings of the congregations on Sundays and holy-days,and on occasions of the benedictions of marriedwomen, and the purifications of those after childbirth,all which contributions were publicly made inthe churches. The mayor and citizens of Dublin,however, alleged that this exaction had grown intoa grievance, and, with the object of correcting its excess,they in 1267 made a penal order, that no citizensshould presume to make their offerings morethan four times in the year, and restrained the numberattending new-married and child-bed women uponthese occasions to two, instead of the numerous trainsthat were usually in attendance. They also seizedthe wax candles that were carried on occasions offuneral processions, and which had been theretoforeusually given to the churches, and deposited them intheir own halls ; leaving only two wax-lights to thechurch where the person was buried. They likewiseordered, that no prelate or ecclesiastical judge withinthe city, should hold plea of usury or of any othercrime or cause, except what were matrimonial or testamentary,and that they should have no cognizanceof intestate goods, which they directed to be paidH 2ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.into the exchequer ; and further prescribed thatno citizen, even in causes ecclesiastical, should beobliged to appear in judgment out of the limits of thecity. These arbitrary measures were highly resentedby the archbishop, who, finding all admonitionsineffective by his ordinary authority, promulgatedthe sentence of excommunication against the offenders,and put the city under an interdict ; a coursefor the maintenance of the privileges of the Church,which was approved by Cardinal October, then legatein London, and who sent his mandate, dated onthe 28th of February in the same year, to theBishops of Lismore and Waterford, directing themsolemnly to denounce with bells tolling, and candleslighted, the said mayor and citizens as excommunicated,in all public places within the city and provinceof Dublin. At length, in the summer following,Sir Robert de Afford, Lord Justice, and thePrivy Council interposed in these quarrels, and acomposition was made between the archbishop andthe citizens ; the terms of which, as they appear onrecord, were, that if any citizen committed a publicsin, he should for the first offence pay a fine, if hesinned so a second time, and that the crime was enormousand public, then he should be beaten round thechurch ; if he offended a third time, he should besolemnly and publicly beaten before the processionsmade to Christ Church or St. Patrick s, and if, afterthis penance, he should persist in his sin, the officerof the archbishop might give notice of it to the mayorand bailiffs, who were enjoined to either expel himFull DE Sandford. 101from the city, or beat him through it. It was furtheragreed, that a general inquisition should be madeonce in every year through the metropolis, in relationto all public sins ; and that, if great necessity existedfor so doing, such an inquisition should be held twiceor three times in one year, but on no account oftener.Provided always, that no citizen should be drawn outof the deanery of said city," by any officials of thearchbishop, but should answer within it to all justcomplaints before his ordinaries.About the same time, this prelate erected thechurch of Killuskcy, near the town of Wicklow,into a prebend, and annexed it to the archdeaconryof Glendalough for ever ; by right of which, Hughde Clandestine, at that time Archdeacon, became entitledto a stall in the choir, a voice in the chapterof St. Patrick s Cathedral,* and to all the otherprivileges of a canon. This prelate also purchasedthirty acres of land, near Tipperkevin, from WilliamSyreburn, and annexed them to his see, for theprofits whereof, John de Sandford, Escheated ofIreland, and afterwards, himself, Archbishop of Dublin,passed his accounts in the exchequer, after thedeath of Fulk, and during the vacancy of the see.On the 25th of July, 1270, Prince Edward, towhom his royal father had some years previouslygiven the sovereignty of all that part of Ireland,which was then subjected to English dominion;directed his mandate to his Lord Deputy, and officersAllen s Registry.102 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.of justice in Ireland; grounded on information,that some miscreants, doubtless, some of those in-corruptible felons, whom ecclesiastical censures didbut exasperate to more mortal offences, had attemptedthe life of de Sandford and of his officers,and the prince thereby commanded, that whateverpowers the prelate might require for the exercise ofhis ecclesiastical authority, should be fully grantedand assured to him, while he at the same time directedall justices and other officers, to repress anyinvasions or attempts against the liberties of theChurch.On the 6th of May, 1271, Archbishop Fulk diedin his manor of Finglas ; whereupon his body wasconveyed to St. Patrick s Church, and there depositedin the chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary.Immediately on his decease, King Henry the Thirdgranted to Prince Edward all the issues and profitsof the archbishopric, in aid of his expenses to theHoly Land ; saving, however, knights fees, wardships,reliefs, escheats, and advowsons of all ecclesiasticalpromotions; and he sent a writ to the Es-creatorof Ireland, dated the thirteenth of June inthat year, reciting the above grant, and commandinghim not to interfere in the receipt thereof, but toconsign that portion of the revenues to the lawfulattorneys of Prince Edward, and, if he had theretoforecollected any of such funds, to pay over same tothe said persons. The king, however, at the sametime, granted a licence for the election of a successorto Fulk ; and on the twenty-ninth of the ensuingFull DE SAUNDFORD. 103July, William che la Corner, the Pope s chaplain, andthe king s counsellor, who, in some years afterwards,was promoted to the see of Salisbury, was elected tothis dignity by the prior and convent of the HolyTrinity ; but on the same day, the dean and chapterof St. Patrick s made choice of Found le Brun,the Pope s chaplain, and then Lord Chancellor ofIreland, in consequence of which difference of nomination,a tedious controversy ensued between therespective electors, which did not terminate until1279? when the Pope annulled both appointments.In 1272, within two months after his accession tothe throne, Edward the First committed the custodyof the temporalities of this see to Thomas Chatsworth,and authorized him to farm and improve them to theking s best advantage, also directing his Chief Justiceof Ireland to dispose of the revenues of wardships,and to present to vacant churches, as in theright of the crown. In 1273, another recognitionof Robert, the before-mentioned coadjutor " Bishopof Dublin," occurs in a close roll, in which the king,at the instance of his sister, the Queen of Scotland,granted to Robert, " Bishop of Dublin," residingin Scotland, that Robert de Robert (whom thebishop had constituted to act as his deputy), might,in the name of the bishop, make attorneys to appearfor him in all his courts, before any justices andbarons of the exchequer, and in counties, hundreds,and other the king s courts, for him or against himfor seven years, and be exempted from all mercianas for not appearing personally therein. In104 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN .1275 the king issued a mandate for the better managementand cultivation of the lands belonging tothis see ; and in the following year the above-mentoned Chatsworth had an order from the Exchequer,for payment to him of a pension of forty marks perannum, out of the revenues of this see, during thetime he had the custody thereof. At this latter perioda contest arose, between the king and the prior andchapter of the Holy Trinity, as to the right ofappointing the Archdeacon of Dublin during thevacancy of the see ;* and the difference appears tohave continued, until the elevation of John de Derlingtonto the dignity, after a vacancy of seven years,removed the subject matter of the contest.JOHN DE Darlington.[Succ. 1279. Ob. 1284.]The Pope having, as before mentioned, annulledboth the elections in 1271 of William de la Cornerby the prior and convent of the Holy Trinity, and ofFound le Brun by the dean and chapter of St.Patrick s, a tedious and expensive suit was instituted,until, at last, the pontiff declared John de Derlingtonthe due and lawful archbishop. He was so styledfrom Derlington, in the diocese of Durham, theplace of his birth ; was a doctor of divinity, a Dominicanfriar, confessor to the late King Henry theThird, and had been his ambassador to Pope NicholasRot in Turr. Lord.JOHN DE Darlington. 105the Third in 1278.* He was, accordingly, consecratedin Waltham abbey on the 8th of September,1279, by John Archbishop of Canterbury, assistedby Nicholas Bishop of Winchester, Robert Bishop ofBath and Wells, and William Bishop of Norwich ;and his writ of restitution to his temporalities isdated on the following 28th of April. MatthewParis describes him as a prelate of great authority forhis learning and wisdom ; but Bale is so unfavourableto him, that he calls him a " mercenary hireling, andnot a shepherd ; that he went to his archbishopric notto feed, but to milk and shear his sheep ; and that hedied, " divine tacitus ratione," blasted by divine vengeance.It is certain he was collector of the reference,both in England and Ireland, to the Popes,John the Twenty-first, Nicholas the Third, andMartin the Fourth, which was, probably, groundsufficient to induce Bale to deny him any meritwhatsoever. The story of his life is, however, soimperfectly recorded, that it leaves scarcely more torely upon than the certainty of his death an eventwhich carried him off, by sudden visitation, in London,on the 29th of March, 1284, in the fifth yearafter his consecration, in a Dominican convent ofwhich city he was buried.

Ob. 1294.]On the 5th of May after Archbishop Derlington sdeath, the King granted his cone d elite, on thepetition of the dean and chapter of St. Patrick s, presentedby John de Sandford, whom the record callscon-canonical noster," our fellow canon, and onwhom the choice of the electors fell. He was anative of England, brother of the former prelate ofthat name, dean of St. Patrick s, a Franciscan friar,and, for a time, escheator of Ireland. Being canon i-call elected, he was confirmed by the king on the20th of July, 1284, and, on the 6th of August following,had his writ for restitution to the temporalities,having first, with some difficulty, obtained the Pope sconfirmation, who, at first, raised some objections tothe appointment ; but, on de Sandford resigning hisright to the absolute discretion of the pontiff, Honorispromoted him to, or rather confirmed him in,the dignity, recommending him, by a Bull of 1285,to the King s favour, which had, in truth, been previouslyevinced. All interests thus concurring, hewas consecrated in the church of the Holy Trinity,Dublin, on Palm Sunday, 1286.In his early life he had come into Ireland, it wouldappear, as vicar-general of his brother Fulk de Soundford, and was presented by the Baroness of Nags tothe rectory of Maynooth.* In 1266 he was en-cretemihi.JOHN DE Sandford. 107trusted with the absolute management of his brother saffairs, and, in some records, is expressly denominatedhis vicar-general. In 1268 he was one of the mediatorsand witnesses of the final concord between thatprelate and the citizens of Dublin, and, in the followingyear, was the arbitrator of a dispute existing with thePrior of Kilmainham relative to the archbishop s visitatorialpower. In 1272 he was appointed escheator ofIreland, and, in 1274, was joined in commission withthe Lord Justice and the Bishop of Meath to administerthe oath of allegiance, and receive the fealty of all archbishops,bishops, abbots, clergy, nobles, and others theking s subjects of Ireland. In 1279he was a Justice ofthe King s Bench, and, in 1282, was specially selected bythe king to raise money, by loan, from the clergy andlaity, to be employed in the necessities of the state,on account of the insurrection of the Welch.* In1283 he had a grant of " wastes" lying in Connaught,at the annual rent of 34, and doing service andsuit at the court of Roscommon ; nor was his influencewith royalty diminished on his appointment to thissee. In 1 288, after the death of Stephen de Auburn,he was constituted Lord Justice of Ireland, with anallowance of 500 per annum for the support of hisgovernment ; and, on the 7th of March, 1289, theking granted to him and his successors the right offree warren in all his demesne lands of the mountainsof the county of Dublin ; so that none should enterthereon to chase or hunt without the archiepiscopallicence, under a penalty of 10 for each offence.Rymer s Foeclera.108 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.In 1291 Pope Nicholas having commanded, thata tenth of all ecclesiastical rents, profits, and oblationsin Ireland, according to their true value, should bepaid to the King of England, towards the expenses ofa meditated crusade, this prelate was of those namedto oversee the collection; and, "because," adds thedocument, "there are various valuations of theserevenues in that country, we impose it on your consciences,that, on due consultation in the places to betaxed, you study to assess the true and honest valuethereof"* such a valuation was, accordingly, madein the course of three years, and is yet extant, thatof this see is entitled, " Nova taxation Dioceses ;" and in it very great alterations were madefrom the former, some being increased, others lessened,and some wholly omitted, according to the newcircumstances of the times. This estimate is, in alegal point of view, the more important, because allthe taxes, as well to the successive kings as to thepopes, were regulated by it down to the 20th year ofthe reign of Henry VIII.About the year 12Q3, Archbishop John was sentwith Anthony, Bishop of Durham, on an embassy tothe emperor, to treat with him concerning the restitutionof Bourdeaux and the adjacent country ofGascony, which had been taken possession of by theKing of France sometime previously. Having successfullyacquitted himself in this negotiation, he returnedinto England, but was immediately afterwardsRymer s Fcedera ad arm.JOHN DE SAUNDFORD. 10 ( J(in October, 1294,) "seized with a grievous disorder,"says Matthew of Westminster, " and went theway of all flesh." Prynne alleges that he died inreturning from the King of Arragon, to whom hehad been sent to negotiate some affairs connectedwith the interest of England. His body was, on thepetition of the canons of St. Patrick s, conveyed intoIreland, and on the 20th of February after his death,buried in his brother s monument in their church.The letter written by the canons upon this occasion,beseeching to give him the possession of a buryingplace amongst them, is yet preserved in the Cottonlibrary. He was a prelate in great reputation forlearning, wisdom, and discretion, as the few particularswhich are detailed of his life sufficiently establish.On his death, the chapters of Christ Church andSt. Patrick s assembled at the cathedral of the HolyTrinity, and chose Adam de Furness, a canon of theHoly Trinity, and vicar of Kilcullen, official of thediocese during the vacancy of the see, the custody ofthe temporalities of which the king, by writ* bearingdate the 20th of October, in the year 1295, grantedto Richard de Abingdon during pleasure, but reservedthe profits to be accounted for in the exchequer; and on the 20th of December following, hegave licence to the dean and chapter of St. Patrick s,and to the prior and convent of the Holy Trinity,to proceed to the election of a new archbishop. TheyRot. Pat. 22 Edw. I.HO ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.had, however, before the licence issued, irregularlyelected Thomas de Chadsworth, who was also Dean ofSt. Patrick s to this dignity ; on information of which,they were obliged to sue out a new cone d elite,dated 24th of March in the same year (old style), byvirtue whereof, they unanimously re-elected Chatsworth,and submitted such their nomination to theking, on the 28th of April, 1296, who, thereupon,gave his royal assent, and certified the same to Rome.The Pope, however, vacated the election, and appointedWilliam de Hothum thereto.Immediately previous to this determination of thepontiff, the Dean of St. Patrick s, together with thePrior of the Holy Trinity, preferred a complaint tohis holiness of encroachments made by Richard deNorthampton, Bishop of Ferns, on their right to exercisethe jurisdiction of the archbishop during thevacancy of the see ; whereupon Boniface referred thematter to the Prior of All Saints, Dublin, who wasauthorized to inquire into the ground of complaint,and to see justice done. The see being filled, however,the controversy was necessarily terminated.WILLIAM DE HOTHUM.[Succ. 1297. Ob. 1298.]The Pope, having so vacated the election ofThomas de Chadsworth, on the 16th of June, 1297,by provision confirmed the aforesaid William de Hothun in the archbishopric ; and, accordingly, on theWILLIAM DE HOTHUM. Ill8th of December, 1297> the king issued his writ*reciting the election of Chadsworth, its cassation bythe Pope, and the appointment of de Hothum ; and,thereupon, acquainted the canons of the free chapelof Penkeriz (before mentioned in 1216), that he hadrestored Hothum to the temporalities, commandingthem to obey him as their archbishop. Edward alsosent a writs to Richard de Abingdon, custodes of thetemporalities, directing him to give this prelate thepreference of pre-emption of the ploughs, cattle, andstock upon the lands of the see, and another writs tothe justices, escheats, and sheriffs, requiring themto suffer him to enjoy all the liberties and privilegeswhich any of his predecessors had enjoyed. Thebusiness of his life, however, appears to have beenlittle associated with the privileges or interests of hisprovince.He was born in England, but educated at Paris,where he took the degree of Doctor of Divinity in1280, afterwards became a Dominican friar, and wastwice provincial of that order in England; on oneoccasion as ambassador at Rome from King Edwardthe First to Pope Boniface the Eighth, he executedthe trust with great applause, being inferior to nonefor learning, virtue, gravity, integrity, and judgmentin the management of affairs. The Pope gave hima dispensation, not unfrequent at the period, to beconsecrated by any bishop whom he should select ;Rot. Pat. 25 Edw. I. t Ib.See De Burgo Hib. Dom.112 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.Pits and others, however, maintain that he was consecratedat Rome in 1298, by the Pope himself, andthat he died on his return ; but Harris considers Walsinghammore correct in asserting, that he was consecratedin that year at Ghent in Flanders, by AnthonyBeak, Bishop of Durham, and with them agree theAnnals of St. Mary s Abbey. Immediately after hisconsecration, he was recognised as the active organof reconciliation between Philip the Fourth of Franceand Edward the First of England, and ultimately, byhis discretion and tact, effected a truce between thesemonarchs, which continued for two years. He, thereupon,returned to Rome, with the articles of thetreaty, which the Pope established ; and it was on hisjourney homewards from this mission through Burgundy,that he fell ill at Dijon, where he died in amonastery of his order, on the 27th of August in thesame year. His body was conveyed into England,and buried in a Dominican monastery in London.Bale, although he asperses his character and thatof the Pope who promoted him, on the suggestionthat he attained his honour by the mediation of gold,yet allows, that he was " a man highly extolled bythe writers of his own order, as a person of a greatspirit, acute parts, and one who had a singular dexterityin conciliating to himself the favour of menatrait which must have induced his frequent engagementsin state negotiations. He is, also, spoken ofin high terms of praise by Laurence Pignorius, Sebastiande Oviedo, Hernandez, Fontana, Since,Possevin, &c. Ware adds, that he was the author ofWILLIAM DE HOTHUM. 113some works of divinity, and of a French oration onthe king s right to Scotland.On the 24th of September after his decease, awrit issued to the Treasurer and Barons of the Exchequerto seize the temporalities of the see, and tocommit the custody thereof to some faithful person,for whose conduct they would be responsible. Onthe 21st of January following, Adam de Balsam,Prior of Christ Church, was chosen Archbishop bythat convent, while the Dean and Chapter of St.Patrick s selected their before-mentioned dean, Thomasde Chadsworth, then one of the Justices of theKing s Bench; but neither of these elections wasapproved of by the king ; and, having been madewithout his previous licence, each of these ecclesiasticalbodies was attached for the contempt. The Deanand Chapter of St. Patrick s shewed what was deemedsufficient cause for pardon ; but the temporalities ofthe prior were estreated and granted to John, Vicarof Lusk.* A lapse having occurred, by reason of thiscontest, the Pope asserted a title to provide for thedignity, and, accordingly, nominated Richard deFerings, who had been in 1281, and during the fifteenprevious years, Archdeacon of Canterbury,! andwho, upon this nomination, was consecrated about themiddle of the year, 1299.Vide Riley s Place.

Ob. 130G.]This prelate, immediately after his consecration,appears to have made that conveyance of Churchlands, alluded to by Carte in the introduction to hisLife of Ormond, whereby, with the consent of theChapters of the Holy Trinity and St. Patrick s, hegranted to Theobald Fits Walter Butler of Ireland,and to his heirs, the lands of Inchmeholmoc, Kilpoch,and fifteen other lowlands, with the churches,chapels, advowsons, and all liberties thereto belonging,yielding to the archbishop and his successors twomarks of silver yearly ; to the church of the HolyTrinity in Dublin, two pounds of wax at Easter ; andto the church of St. Patrick two pounds more in lieuof all services and demands. He, nevertheless, encounteredsome difficulty in obtaining restitution ofhis temporalities, as, when he presented the Pope sprovisional letters to the king, they were consideredto contain clauses prejudicial to the royal prerogative.He removed the ground of objection, however, byan express renunciation of any benefit therefrom, anda public declaration that it never was his intentionto sue forth, do, or prosecute anything that couldoperate to the prejudice of the crown, or in any mannertend thereto. This renunciation, dated 30thMay, 1300, is of record in the Tower of London.The king, thereupon, took his fealty, and, on the followingday, issued his writ of restitution, and, at thesame time, another writ to the canons of the freeRichard DE Ferns. 115chapel of Penkcriz (of which, as before-mentioned,the Archbishops of Dublin were deans), in similarterms with that issued in favour of de Hothum, in1297.Immediately afterwards this prelate applied himselfto effect a right understanding between his two cathedralchurches, and succeeded in establishing what theWhite Book of Christ Church calls "a final and full concordand amicable agreement of their various controversiesand wrangles," which was reduced into writing,and strengthened by the common seal of each chapter,with a penalty annexed. The heads of the agreementare to be found in Archbishop Allen s Registry,of which the principal were, " That the Archbishopsof Dublin should be consecrated and enthroned inChrist Church That both churches should be calledcathedral and metropolitan That Christ Church,as being the greater, the mother, and the elder church,should have the precedence in all rights and concernsof the see, and that the cross, mitre, and ring of everyarchbishop, in whatever place he died, should be depositedtherein ; and lastly, that each church shouldhave the alternate right of sepulture of the bodies oftheir archbishops, unless otherwise directed by theirseveral wills ; and these articles were, accordingly,agreed to in the year 1300. After thus composing,as he thought, the jealousies that had existed betweenhis cathedrals, the archbishop resided for the mostpart abroad, having constituted Thomas de Chatsworth,whose election to the see the Pope had beforetwice annulled, his vicar-general.r 2116 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.In 1 302 a writ* issued to the Lord Justice of Ireland,directing that the archbishop s bailiffs shouldhave liberty to transmit money to him to Englandfor his support they giving security not to send itelsewhere, non obstante any former writ prohibitingthe exportation of money from Ireland, by meanswhereof the remitting of the archbishop s money hadtheretofore been retarded. In the same year EdmundButler recovered from de Feelings the manor of Hollywoodin Fingal with the appurtenances, as mentionedin the " History of the County of Dublin." Thereis a record extant in the rolls of parliament, concerninga journey undertaken in the same year by thisprelate to Canterbury ; but it contains little more thanan account of a broil between his attendants and thoseof the Bishop of Ely. In 1303 (28th of January,)he was summoned to appear in person at the parliament,which should be holden in England next afterthe date of the writ ; and in the same year he constitutedthe churches of Stagonil and Tipperkevin prebendsof St. Patrick s cathedral.In 1304 he renewed the privileges granted byhis predecessors to the Dean and Chapter of St.Patrick s, and particularly the exemption of theirprebendal churches, and the churches of the Economy,from visitations of the archdeacon or dean ; and in1306 a third valuation having been made of the dignitiesand benefices of Ireland, with the object ofassessing them to the Pope s taxation of one-tenth.,Rot.

Havering,however, under colour of his election and provision,enjoyed for four years the profits of the see withoutconsecration ; and in 1309 had writ of summons to aparliament to be held at Westminster, on the secondSunday in Lent, as Bishop elect of Dublin, by whichtitle he was also styled by King Edward the Second,in a letter to Philip, King of France, dated the 19thof June, 1309, and in the royal charter of the followingyear, confirming to this prelate all the libertiesand free customs appertaining to the see, he is namedRichard, Archbishop of Dublin, elect and confirmed."In the same year John Wogan, Justiciaryof Ireland, was ordered to arrest the Templar andimprison them in the Castle of Dublin, to be forthcomingto answer the Archbishop elect of Dublin orhis vicar, and the other inquisitors, in such mattersas might be there objected to them ; the archbishopreceiving an authority to that effect in similar terms,both which last documents are recorded in the Towerof London. In 1310 he erected the church of Aldergginto a prebend, but at the close of that year, underRolls of Parliament, vol. i. p, 208.120 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.the influence of a dream, as it was reported, hevoluntarily resigned his see, upon which the king,by writ* of 6th January 13 10, directed his justiciaryto take charge of the temporalities, immediately afterwhich, according to the Annals published by Camden,Alexander de Bicker was on St. Patrick s day,1310, elected archbishop by the unanimous voice ofboth chapters ; but, notwithstanding this election,John Lech, chaplain and almoner to King Edwardthe Second, succeeded by the favour of that prince.JOHN LECH,[Succ. 1310. Ob. 1313.]John Lech, the successor of Havering, had beenpreviously, in the year 1309, elected to the bishopricof Dunkeld, in Scotland, of which church he was acanon ; and, on the 28th of August in that year, wasearnestly recommended to the pope for his confirmation,by the king, who was indeed so earnest inhis behalf, as to write likewise to six of the cardinalsfor their interest with his holiness on this occasion,and to the auditor and advocate of the court of Rome.On the 14th of December following, Edward appointedhim his proctor, to take into his custodyall the books, vestments, plates, and other ornamentsof the chapel of Matthew, late Bishop of Dunkeld,which fell to him on the death of the said Matthew,according to the custom of Scotland. This appearsto have been the first assumption, as of supremacy,Rymer s Federal,JOHN LECH. 121after the conquest of Scotland by King Edward theFirst; and it was met by a counter-election ofWilliam Sinclair to that see, by the loyal Scots, inthe allegiance of Bruce. This appointment was foratime violently opposed by King Edward, but atlength, by the perseverance of Sir Henry Sinclair,Laird of Rosin, and brother of William, the Englishmonarch was induced to write to the Pope, in favourof the elect bishop, on the 8th of February, 1312,having previously obtained the Pope s ratificationand appointment of Lech to this better preferment,as appears by the royal letter of thanks dated on the5th of April, 1311. On this advancement of Lech,whom Edward, in his letter, calls Bishop elect ofDunkeld, the royal mandate, bearing date the 20thof July in the same year, issued to Richard deHavering, who, after his resignation, had been madecustodes of the temporalities during the vacancy,to hand them over to the new prelate, who had, accordingto custom, renounced all prejudicial clausesin the Pope s provision, and submitted himself entirelyto his favour ; while, at the same time, a furtherwrit for restitution of his temporalities was directedto John Wogan, then Lord Justice of Ireland. Inthe same year, and last mentioned month, (July,) onthe application of this prelate, Pope Clement theFifth issued his bull for founding a Universityfor scholars in Dublin, but this design, so creditableto the memory of Lech, was not destined tobe then effectuated, the attention of its originatorRymerARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.having been unhappily diverted by the unbecomingcontroversy concerning the primacy, which had restedsince 1261, but was revived by him. Walter Horse,then Archbishop of Armagh, thereupon petitionedthe king, and had the usual permission to appear inparliament by his attorneys for the trial of the question.Accordingly, in a parliament held at Kilkennybefore the Lord Justice Wogan, these prelateswarmly urged their respective claims; Jorse, however,in the November following, withdrew anyfurther opposition on his part, and, although it wassought to be renewed by Jorse s brother and successor,Roland Jorse, in the remarkable manner mentionedin the " History of the County of Dublin" atHowth ;" yet, on the utter failure of his attemptat that time, he likewise desisted from asserting theclaim.At the close of the year 1312, Archbishop Lechwas constituted Lord Treasurer of Ireland, soon afterwhich, on the 10th of August, 1313, he died, butneither of his cathedrals, notwithstanding the previousarrangement, was destined to receive the bodyof the prelate, which was interred at Westminster,in the middle of the chancel of the abbey. Immediatelyon his decease, the prebend of Cullenwas ordered to be sequestered on account of certainsums due by him to the Pope, and which WilliamLech, his treasurer, had neglected to pay ;* while,011 the 29th of October following, the king issued awrit to the sheriff of York, to seize all the goods andOrig. Archie. Hath. St. Trin.ALEXANDER DE BICKNOK. 123chattels of the said prelate, which were within hisbailiwick on the day of his death, for divers debtsdue to the crown.In Ireland, in the mean time, the usual contestensued between the cathedrals for the appointmentof his successor, one party nominating Walter Thorn-bury,then chanter of St. Patrick s, and Chancellorof Ireland, while the other declared for Alexanderde Bicker, the descendant of an English familyvery distinguished in the time of Edward the First,and himself then Prebendary of Maynooth andTreasurer of Ireland ; Walter, soon after his election,took shipping for France, where the Pope then heldhis court ; but, on the night of his departure, a stormarose, and he and 156 other passengers were all castaway; whereupon, as if heaven had promulgated itsjudgment, de Bicker s election was no longeropposed.ALEXANDER DE Bicker.[Sue. 1317. Ob. 1349.]Alexander de Bicker having been, as beforementioned, elected, and thus far established in hishigh situation, by the death of Walter Thornbury,took a journey to Lyons with the king s letters, datedthe 29th of January, 1314,* earnestly recommendinghim to the Pope as "a man of profound judgment,high morality, deep learning, strict integrity, andRymer s Feed. vol. ii. p. 241.124 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.withal the greatest circumspection in spiritual andtemporal affairs. * His confirmation was, nevertheless,postponed, in consequence of his sovereign requiringhis personal services. Accordingly, on the27th of May in the same year, Edward the Secondjoined him in a commission with Raymond Subiraniand Andrew Saith, to transact some secret affairs ofconsequence, in relation to his foreign dominions,with the cardinals attending the Pope at Avignon,to twenty-four of whom he wrote special letters uponthis occasion. At last Pope John the Twenty-firstconfirmed his appointment to this see, " upon thescore of his great learning and conspicuous birth,"and he was afterwards consecrated at Avignon, althoughnot until the 22nd of July, 1317, by Nicholasde Prato, Cardinal of Ostium. The Bulls of his confirmationwere read and published in Christ Church,Dublin, (where they are still preserved), on the followingfeast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin ;immediately previous to which, the guardian of thespiritualities of this see had letters of credence fromthe king, and a request of aid towards the war againstBruce and the Scots.In the first year of his appointment, King Edwardgranted to this prelate the liberty of acquiring lands,tenements, advowsons, &c. in Ireland, to the value of200 yearly, excepting such as were held in fee ofthe crown, to hold to him and his successors for ever;and in the same year Pope John the Twenty-secondwrote to him, as also to the Archbishop of Cashel,and Dean of Dublin, to excommunicate Robert BruceALEXANDER DE BICKNOR. 125and his followers, and likewise Edward his brother,if they did not render satisfaction and make restitutionfor the ravages, murders, robberies, and burningsof churches committed throughout the kingdom bytheir adherents.* The pontiff then also issued hismandate to the same individuals, to proceed by inquisitionagainst the order of mendicants, and all whohad presumed to alienate the affections of the peopleof Ireland from their true prince, King Edward, orwho should, by open preaching or private cabals, disputethe right of the crown of England over the subjectsof that kingdoms Yet, even this importantaccession of authority did not induce de Bicker tovisit his see, nor did he take upon him its actualgovernment until that of the whole island was superadded.He arrived as Archbishop of Dublin andLord Justice of Ireland on the 9th of October, 1318,and was received both by the clergy and people withgreat acclamations of joy. On the 10th of Novemberfollowing, he was summoned with the prelatesand nobles to attend a parliament at Lincoln, "but,"say the Lords committee on the Peerage, " on whatground the writ to the Archbishop of Dublin wasissued, the committee have not discoverers Itmight, possibly, have been in right of the manor ofPenkeriz in England, before mentioned as conferredupon de Loundres and his successors. In the sameyear he had a very full confirmation of the lands ofthe see as in the grant enumerated ; in 1318 wasRymer s Foedera-j- tb. } First Report, p. 276.Rot. in Turr. Lord.126 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.twice re-summoned to a parliament at Lincoln, and,on the 8th of June in the same year, received theroyal intimation that the parliament, so summonedand prorogued, was revoked in consequence of theinvasion of the Scots. In two days afterwards he waspresent in the green chamber in the palace of Westminster,when the great seal was surrendered by theBishop of Winchester ; and on the 9th of August inthe same year, assented on the part of the king to thetreaty with the Earl of Lancaster, imposing restrictionson the royal authority, and joined in guaranteeingthe same.*In 1320 he founded a university in St. Patrick schurch, Dublin, which was confirmed by the authorityof Pope John the Twenty-second, and public lectureswere established, but, in the deficiency of the endowment,this project again failed to be effective. His rulesfor the government of this infant seminary may be seenin Ware s Antiquities, p. 243. The professors of theologyelected on its institution were two Dominicanfriars and one Franciscan. f Two years afterwards heconstituted the church of Inisboyne a prebend inSt. Patrick s cathedral, and in the same year thePope imposed upon the clergy of Ireland, an assessmentof two years tenths on all ecclesiastical beneficesfor the use of the king. In 1323 Archbishopde Bicker was sent ambassador to France by theparliament of England, together with Edmund ofWoodstock, Earl of Kent, King Edward the Second sPart. Writs. ] De Burgo Hib.

J In the ensuing year, however, de Bickerfell greatly under the king s displeasure for beinginstrumental in causing the surrender of the townand castle of La Royale in Aquitain to its Frenchbesiegers, when it was considered it might have beendefended, and for falsely charging the king s chamberlain,Hugh Despenser, with treason. Of theseoffences the king by letter, dated the 28th of May,1325, made a heavy complaint to the Pope, entreatinghis holiness to banish this prelate from his kingdomand dominions, and to have another appointedWalsingham Hypodig. Neustria.t Rymer Fond. vol. ii. p. 573. } Id. 554.128 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.to his situation ; while he adds, what was perhapsthe real origin of the royal displeasure, that the archbishophad mismanaged the crown revenues in Ireland,was greatly in arrear, and had likewise soencumbered the property of the church that it couldnever rise again.*In 1326 he appears amongst the prelates andbarons of England, who met at Bristol on the occasionof the king s son being appointed guardian ofthe realm, which his father had abandoned in companywith Hugh le Despenser the younger andother enemies of the States In the following year,the profits of this see were in the king s hands, anda writ issued to the treasurer and chamberlains of theexchequer, authorizing disbursements out of its revenuesin order to maintain the war against the rebels ;probably this was in satisfaction for the arrears allegedto be due by de Bicker during his treasurership ;while a petition of the prelate, preserved in the Rollsof Parliament, suggests that these arrears were notincurred in such a wasteful or discreditable manneras his enemies would insinuate. A tax it appears hadbeen imposed on the benefices of Ireland in the timeof Edward the Second, according to an ancient valuation,and this archbishop was appointed to collectand be accountable for it. He pleaded, however,that by wars and otherwise these benefices were notof the profit formerly set down, and wished to passhis accounts according to the true values. He wasRymer s Foedera, vol. ii. p. 600. f Ib. p. 646.ALEXANDER DE BJCKNOR. 129kept, however, to the old estimates, and his revenueswere sequestered for their proportionate discharge.The Pope gave a marked recognition of the justiceof the archbishop s accounts, by appointing him collectorin 1330 of the pontifical tax, but at the sametime instructing him to exempt therefrom all smallbenefices, not exceeding the value of six marks yearly.About the same period, Richard Ledred, Bishopof Ossory, having prosecuted some persons who wereaccused of heresy, they rose against him and kepthim in confinement during seventeen days, until, inconsequence,obliged to fly his diocese, they tookshelter in that of de Bicker, who, it would appear,protected them from further prosecution. Ledredwould thereupon have appealed to Rome, but foundconsiderable difficulty even in getting out of Ireland,in consequence of the steps taken by de Bicker toprevent him. He did, however, ultimately pass intoFrance, where it would seem he was detained by thepower of King Edward. In this exile he was forcedto remain nine years, and the profits and jurisdictionof his see were seized by this archbishop, until thePope was obliged, as hereafter mentioned, to suspendhis metropolitan power over Ledred s diocese, aninterdict which continued until the death of de Backnor.* In 1331 occurred the devastation and plunderof his lands at Tallagh, as more appropriately mentionedat that locality in the " History of the Countyof Dublin." In the close of the same year, the kingWadding s Annals, vol. viii. p. 419.K130 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN".wrote in his favour to the Pope, seeking to induce hisHoliness to discredit the assertions of Ledred in referenceto the dispute between them. In the followingyear de Bicker annexed the church of Wicklow and itstwo appendant chapels, with the consent of its patrons,to the deanery of Glendalough. On the 8th of May,1335, the king directed a mandate to him and othersof Ireland, to accelerate a subsidy and muster in aidof the war against the Scotch ;* and in the same yearthis prelate held a visitation in the diocese of Ossory,which, as Clin says in his Annals, no metropolitan hadvisited for forty years before. His motive on thisoccasion has been already explained, and the consequentwithdrawal of the see from metropolitan authorityby the Pope. In 1336 he had a royal licenceto acquire lands, &c. for the see to the value of 200,in similar terms to that granted to him in 1317-In 1337 Sir John Charleston, Lord Justice, helda parliament in St. Mary s Abbey, Dublin, on whichoccasion the Archbishop of Armagh, having beensummoned, made preparation for his attendance, andinsisted on carrying his crosier erect before him, butwas prevented from so appearing by this prelate andhis clergy, although the king had directed his mandateprohibiting any such opposition, and had speciallyordered the sheriffs and other ministerial officersto avert it.f The prelate of Armagh, thereupon,caused the bull of Pope Urban, mentioned at 1261,to be exemplified under the great seal of Ireland inRymer s Foedera, vol. ii. p, 905. t Ib. p. 1008,DE BICKNOR. 131the November of the same year, but it does not appearthat he took any further steps in prosecution ofthe business. In the same year de Bicker was authorizedby a royal commission to transact certainarduous affairs in and about Mullingar, as well withthe Bishop of Meath as other noblemen, the faithfulsubjects of the county of Meath, to inquire concerningall traitors and their abettors, to establish peacethere in the best mode attainable, and for that purposeto array a militia from amongst the inhabitants,and to punish those impeding the discharge of suchduties.*In July, 1339, he received the royal orders torepair his fortifications at Castlekevin, and was requiredto appear forthwith before the king s councilin England, to give information on the state of affairsin Ireland. In 1347 he obtained a formal pardonfrom the crown, in reference to his collection of thetax before alluded to, or in the harsh, and it wouldseem unjustifiable language of the licence, " forsundry false writs and acquittance, which he had putinto his treasurer s accounts in deceit of the kingsand in 1348 the king wrote in his favour to CardinalAudomar, relative to his right to be exempted fromany subjection to Armagh In the latter year, thisprelate presided at a synod held in Dublin, the actsof which are preserved in the second volume of Wilkinss Cecilia (ad ann.) They enforced the paymentof tithes to mother church; prohibited the abbot.Turr. Beaming. t Rot. in Turr.

Thelatter, being supported by the royal authority,* enteredDublin with the cross erect before him, lodgedin the city and continued in it three nights, openlyread and proclaimed the privileges of his provinceand the bulls of his primacy, in the presence of theLord Justice of Ireland, the Prior of Kilmainham,and such of the peers as were then in town, by whoseinfluence, however, he was sent back to Drogheda,whither many, who had resisted him, followed in theterror of ecclesiastical censures, until in time theyobtained forgiveness.On the 14th of July in the same year, de Bickerdied, having governed this see almost thirty-two years.Ware conjectures that he was buried in St. Patrick schurch, adding, in reference to his character, thathe was no way inferior to any of his predecessors,either in point of wisdom or learning;" while Harrismentions that there is extant in the Registry of Mary sAbbey, an account of a remarkable sermon preachedby him in Christ Church against sloth and idleness,wherein he bitterly complained of the mischiefs arisingfrom the stragglers and beggars, that infested thecity and suburbs of Dublin, and inveighed warmlyagainst every one that would not exercise some tradeor calling every day more or less. His sermon hadsuch influence, that the then mayor of Dublin warmlyadopted its views, and exerted all his authority to en-seeRymer s Foedera, vol. iii. pp. 190, 191, 192.134 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.force diligence and industry throughout the city,He would not suffer an idle person to beg withinhis liberties, but only those who spun and knitted asthey went to and fro, which kind of exercise eventhe begging friars were obliged to imitate, in theapprehension of the archbishop s or the lord mayor scensures"*At the commencement of the year 1350, but beforede Bicker s successor was appointed, the kingrenewed his applications to Cardinal Audomar, requestinghim to intercede with the Pope, to adjustthe claim of primacy between the provinces of Armaghand Dublin.JOHN DE ST.

In the sameyear, this prelate held a synod in Christ Church, theconstitutions and canons of which are preserved inWilkins s Cecilia. They enforced the observanceof the festivals of the Conception, and of St. Annethe mother of the Blessed Virgin, interdicted clandestinemarriages, confirmed the immunities of theChurch, directed the observance of Good Fridayas a feast and holiday, genuflection at the sacredname of Jesus, the reverential bowing at the " GloriaPatrie," and the due publication of ecclesiastical censuresin parish churches. He also about this timeprocured a revocation of the king s letters theretoforegranted to the primate, and a stay of the exerciseof the primacy within the province of Dublin.The king, in his letter of revocation, suggested, thatthe letters granted to the primate had been fallaciouslyobtained, by concealing the truth to the greatprejudice of this see; and he commanded the chancellorto issue writs as often as there should be occasion,and to have public proclamation made, that nobodyWadding s Annals, vol. viii. p. 419.136 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.under peril of life or limb should act to the contrary ;while he likewise directed the justices, officers, andministers to arrest and imprison all offenders in thepremises. Fits Ralph, however, still insisted onthe rights of his church, and this prelate obtainedother letters patent from the king, dated 12th ofMay, 1352, forbidding more strictly any assumptionof the Archbishop of Armagh s power in thisprovince, permitting him, however, to appear byhis proctors, at such parliaments as might be heldwithin it, without being subjected to any mercianor molestation, as for not attending in person.*About the year 1357? the king issued a writ,authorizing de St. Paul to constitute perpetual vicarsin all dignities and prebends of royal patronagewithin his archbishopric, with certain proportions ofgreater or lesser tithes and other revenues for theirsupport, and to enforce their perpetual residence ;he had also, in the same year, licence to appropriatethe advowson of the church of Stackallan, to thevicars of St. Patrick s Cathedrals and obtained ageneral exemplification and confirmation of all hisliberties and courts. In the following year, he wasappointed by the crown a privy councillor, the lorddeputy at the same time receiving a royal order totake him to his council, and to adhere as far as possibleto his suggestions ;J and his first earnest advice,Rymer s Foedera, vol. iii. p. 248. t Rot.

The extent of his patronage was likewiseconfirmed, || and he had a grant, from Simon Lustre,of the advowson of the church of Stackallan, withcertain other premises there, rendering to the Baronof Slane the services due thereout.Having sat in this see about thirteen years, hedied on the 9th of September, 1362, and was buriedin Christ Church, under a marble monument beforeRymer s Foedera, vol. iii. p. 434. f Ib. p. 482.

This prelate much enlargedand beautified the church of the Holy Trinity,having built the choir at his own charge, and didmany other acts of favour to the fraternity, for whichhe was commemorated in an office of nine lessons.*THOMAS MINOT.[Succ. 1363. Ob. 1375.]Thomas Minot succeeded by the Pope s provision,as his predecessor had done, having been Prebendaryof Mullaghiddart, Treasurer of Ireland, andfor a time, also, escheator of that kingdom. He wasconsecrated on Palm Sunday, in 1363, a documentof which year is extant, detailing very fully thetemporal possessions of this see.In 1365, the primatial controversy was renewedbetween him and Milo Sweetman, Archbishop ofArmagh, so warmly, that King Edward the Thirdthought it necessary to interpose again. He accordinglyrequired, that the matter should be adjustedin friendship between them, and that, according tothe example of the prelates of Canterbury and York,both should bear up their crosiers in each other sBook of Obits of Christ Church.THOMAS MINOT. 139provinces, without any interruption, as is evident frommany of the king s writs in this cause, and especiallyfrom his letters directed to Minot, and to the Archbishopof Armagh, both dated the 9th of June, 1365.To which royal suggestions, Milo replied, that inobedience to the writ, he had personally appearedon two days, to treat with the Archbishop of Dublinupon the confines of his province; but, that thelatter, though having notice, did not appear, and onthe last day sent his proctor, who demanded thathe, the Archbishop of Armagh, should obey the injunctionsof the king in every particular, and especiallyin the mutual bearing up of the cross in eachother s province, "which," says he, "I could notagree to for the following reasons. First, as byreason of the shortness of the time I could not havethe advice of my dean and chapter. Second, as inevidence of my primatial privileges, I had by commonlaw by Popes bulls, and Kings concessions,the right of erecting my cross in the province ofDublin, and in all other provinces of the kingdom.Third, that concerning the primatial right, andcarrying the cross in the diocese of Dublin, therehath been a controversy depending for many years,and still remains undecided in the Court of Rome,but no controversy concerning his carrying the crossin my dominions. Fourth, that every Archbishopof Armagh hath, or ought to have, by right andancient custom, three archbishops in Ireland subjectto him, viz. Dublin, Cashel, and Tuam, the latterof whom contended upon this matter, and my ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.decessor had a judicial sentence against him in theCourt of Rome, and obtained a bull from the apostolicsee, that he might by primatial right visit theprovince of Tuam every five years, which bull I havein my custody ; and he therefore concluded, bypraying the king s excuse for not complying withhis writ in that particular, and desiring that no suchwrit should for the future issue out of his chancery.On the third of October following, Lionel, Duke ofClarence, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, issued a writto the sheriff of Dublin, dated at Kilkenny, commandinghim to warn the Archbishop of Dublin toappear before him at Castledermot, on the Tuesdayafter St. Luke s day, there to answer for the aforesaidcontempt, in not meeting and agreeing with theArchbishop of Armagh. The matter, however, proceededno farther at that time.In 1366, the revenues of the precentor of St.Patrick s having been much reduced by the invasionof the Irish from the mountains, this prelate unitedto that dignity the church of Kilmactalway, reservingto himself and his successors two marks for proxies atthe visitation, and half a mark pension to the Deanof Dublin, requiring at the same time that serviceshould be performed there by a sufficient curate.This addition, says Allen, (Resist. f. 201,) was forthe purpose of enabling the dean to live hospitably,give alms, and answer the expenses and charges ofhis office. About the year 1370, Minot repairedpart of St. Patrick s church, which had been destroyedby an accidental fire, and built a very highTHOMAS MINOT. 141steeple of hewn stone, in reference to which an ancientRegistry of St. Patrick s cathedral has the followingcurious notice : " After the burning of St.Patrick s church, sixty straggling and idle fellowswere taken up, and obliged to assist in repairing thechurch and building the steeple, who, when the workwas over, returned to their old trade of begging, butwere banished out of the diocese in 1376 by Archbishopde Wikeford." Their names are inserted inthe Registry. The archbishop felt so gratified at thestructure which he thus completed, that he afterwardsbore on his seal the device of a bishop holding asteeple in his hand. It may be here remarked of thearmorial of this archiepiscopal see, that it bearssapphire, a pastoral staff in pale, designed with a crosspattee topaz, surrounded by a pall silver, edged andfringed gold, charged with five crosses pattee pitchydiamond.In 1373 he is stated to have been one of those,who advised the customs and assessments imposed,and other arbitrary measures enforced by William deWindsor, Lord Deputy,* and in the same year wassummoned to attend a great council to be held inDublin, together with sufficient proctors for his deanand chapter and the clergy of his dioceses In thefollowing year he had licence to erect the church ofRathsallagh into a prebend, and in 1375 had theroyal mandate to attend a council summoned to con-rymers Foedera, vol. iii. pp. 977, 978, and 979.t Rot.

Ob. 1390.]Robert de Wikeford, of the ancient family ofWikeford Hall, in Essex, Archdeacon of Winchester,Doctor of the Civil and Canon Law of the Universityof Oxford, and for a time Fellow of Merton College,was advanced to this see by a provision from PopeGregory the Ninth, dated at Avignon, on the 12thof October, 1375, before the close of which year hewas consecrated. In the Easter following he hadrestitution of the temporalities, but his writ for thatpurpose does not bear date until the 30th of January,1376, when he had performed all the previous requisites.He was in great favour with King Edwardthe Third, and employed by him in many affairs ofimportance before his advancement to this see. Inparticular, in 1370, he was commissioned to treat withWenceslaus, Duke of Brabant, for the entertainmentof that prince and his army in pay during the wars ;in 1371 was sent ambassador, in conjunction withothers, to the Earl of Flanders, in which commissionRot. Pat. in Cane. Hib.ROBERT DE WIKEFORD. 143he is described as a doctor of both laws.* In 1373,being then constable of the castle of Bourdeaux, hewas employed to treat of a league, offensive and defensive,with Peter, King of Arragon, and on the 12thof April, in the same year, was joined in commissionwith Thomas Felon, Seneschal of Aquitain, to takepossession of that principality, then surrendered tothe king by his eldest son, Prince Edward, to whomhe had previously granted it for life. De Wikefordwas at the same time appointed one of the commissionersto hear appeals therein but he did not continuelong in this office, the king having occasion forhis services elsewhere. In the year 1375, a little beforehis advancement to this see, he was condemnedin a suit prosecuted against him by Ivo Beaustan,before Sir Guy de Bryan and Edmund Mortimer,Earl of March, then the king s judges in Aquitain,concerning the right to a prisoner, and without citation,confession, or conviction, all requisite formsbeing pretermitted, was, although absent and in theking s service, adjudged to pay and render 7625franks, 200 marks of silver, two good coursers, andone hackney. From this judgment, however, heappealed to the king and council in England as tohis superior judges, and Edward thereupon sent amandatory writ, dated the 26th of June, 1375,(wherein he styles him his beloved clerk,) to ThomasFelon, seneschal of Aquitain, William de Elmham,seneschal of Gascony, and Richard Retour, thenRymer s Foeclera. f Ib.144 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.constable of Bourdeaux, commanding them to supersedethe said judgment, to cite the said Ivo to appearbefore the king and council at Westminster, the dayafter the purification following, and to stand to suchdecree as the king and council should make in thepremises. On the 3rd of August, in the same year,the king, at the request of the prior and convent ofthe Holy Trinity, and of the dean and chapter of St.Patrick s, granted them licence to choose a bishop inthe place of Thomas Minot, deceased, and theirchoice falling on de Wikeford was confirmed as beforementioned.Immediately on his appointment, he was summonedto attend a parliament to be held in Dublin.*A remarkable law case is mentioned connected with thisperiod of the archbishop s life : one Thomas, a clerkin England, obtained judgment against him beforehe was archbishop for 10, and, upon affidavit thatthe defendant lived in Ireland and had goods andlands there, and the sheriff s return that he had nogoods or lands in England, the plaintiff had a writof fieri facias against him when archbishop, to levythe said money out of his lands and chattels inIreland.In the parliamentary representation which sat atWestminster in 1376, the proctors representing theclergy of the diocese of Dublin were John Fits Ellisand Thomas Abelard. In Ireland, it may be hereobserved, the clergy seemed to have early compliedRot. Clans, in Cane. Hib.ROBERT DE WIKEFORD. 145with the model of Edward the First in sending proctorsto parliament ; and, while the archbishops andbishops, mitred abbots, and priors sat in the upperhouse, the proctors assembled in the lower. In thatyear de Wikeford was appointed Chancellor of Ireland,and in 1377 received a mandatory writ to alterthe great seal by changing Edward into Richard ;while, at the same time, he had a liberate for 20from the treasury, for his expenses in attending " agreat council"* He was also at that time summonedto attend a parliament to be held at Castledermot,fand ordered to direct the deans and chapters of hiscathedrals to choose sufficient proxies to appear forthem on the occasioned In 13/8 he had an exemplificationand confirmation of the manor of Swordsto him and his successors, and on the 23rd of April,1380, had a grant to the see of all its possessions, byone of those little slips of parchment which formerlyconveyed whole baronies, while the smallest estatesof modern times are deemed to require a pile ofskins for their transmission. In the same year theassizes, which were to be held before him, were, onthe petition of the council, postponed, in consequenceof his necessary attendance in England. In 1381he was directed by royal mandate to appoint collectorsof a clerical subsidy for the service of the States andsummoned to attend a parliament in Dublin, withsufficient proctors for his dean and chapter and theclergy of his dioceses He was also required in theRot.

J In 1385he was again appointed Lord Chancellor. In 1387he had a confirmation of the right of holding a fairat Swords, and also obtained a grant to the see ofthat half of the centred of the abbacy of Glendalewhich lay next to the castle of Bally more,and in 1389 was one of the persons appointed toassess the clergy and commons of the County ofDublin, for a prescribed subsidy which they hadgrand ted. 1 1Early in 1390 he had leave of absence for oneyear to visit England's during which interval, on the29th of August, 1390, he died. In the Book of Obitsof Christ Church it is recorded of this prelate, that herevised and released to that cathedral an annual paymentof five marks, which his predecessors had receivedfor archiepiscopal proxies, and in return ayearly commemoration was appointed for him therewithan office of nine lessons.ROBERT WALDBY.[Succ. 1391.

He is said to have been born inthe city of York, but to have received the first elementsof his education in the abbey of Tickell inYorkshire, where Ware conjectures his brother andhe assumed the habit of the Augustinian order. Heafterwards attended the Black Prince into foreignparts, and fixed his abode at Tholouse, " where,"says Bale, " he at last arrived to such a pitch of eminence,that he was reckoned in the first rank amongstthe learned both for his eloquence and skill in languages.He next became divinity professor at Tholouse,and such an excellent preacher, that he wasadvanced to the highest promotions." These illustriousqualifications gained him the esteem of PrinceEdward, who never failed to patronize men of learningand morality, and he bestowed upon him thebishopric of Ayre. Nor was his influence lessenedon the accession of Richard the Second, who, in1383, sent him to treat with John, Duke of Lancaster,that had set up a title to the kingdoms of Castile andLeon, and such was the royal confidence in Waldby,that he was at the same time entrusted with threeother commissions, one to treat of a peace with Peter,King of Arragon, another to negotiate a mutualleague with Charles, King of Navarre, and a thirdto effect the reduction of John, Earl of Armagnac,the king s vassal, to true obedience.*In 1392, after he was about a year in this seethesame monarch constituted him Chancellor of Ire-rymers Foedera.L2148 AilCHBISHOPS^OF DUBLIN.land ; at which time he appointed Richard Milford,Bishop of Chichester, treasurer of this kingdom ; andin the following year, Waldby had restitution of allsuch his liberties as had been theretofore encroachedupon.* In 1394, and a second time in 1395, he hadfull confirmations to him and his successors of allformer grants and privileges conferred upon the seesand at the close of the same year was ordered to berestored to certain parcels of church lands, which hispredecessors had attempted to alien. In 1395 he wassummoned to a great council to be held at Kilkenny,!where he obtained a confirmation of the jurisdiction,privileges, pleas, courts, fairs, franchises, customs,and appurtenances to his see belonging, with theliberty of a boat on the Anna Liffey ; and he soonafterwards received from the Pope, a faculty of fillingsundry benefices within his diocese, the patronage ofwhich had by lapse devolved upon his Holiness. Inthe same year, the before-mentioned Richard method,Bishop of Chichester, having been translatedto the see of Sarum, Doctor Waldby succeeded himin that of Chichester, where, however, he sat but ashort time, and in 1396 was further promoted to theArchbishopric of York.Immediately on his translation from Dublin, thekino issued his mandate to the chancellor, treasurer,ojustices, barons, and escheats of Ireland, empoweringthem to inquire concerning certain alienation ofthe see lands alleged to have been made by him,Rot. in Turr.

He was theson of a mayor of London, and born near that city.Having become a Carmelite friar, he obtained sucha high reputation for his preaching, learning, andother acquirements, as attracted the notice of the king,who advanced him to the bishopric of Ossory in 1386.About the year 1390 he was constituted a commissionerby the king to inspect into the state, losses,and abuses of and in the government of Ireland, andinto the corruptions and fraud of the officers therewithpowers to call before him all peers, prelates, andRot. in Cane.

And all prelates,peers, and other subjects, were commanded to beaiding and assisting to him in the execution of thismultifarious commission. In 1391 and 1394 he wasemployed by the same monarch in the quality of anambassador to Pope Boniface the Ninth, and was appointedChancellor of Ireland in 1393.Having spent about nine years in the prelacy ofOssory, he was in 1396 promoted, as before mentioned,to this archbishopric ; an honour, however,which he enjoyed but for a very short interval, anddying in Dublin on the 20th of July, 1397, wasburied in his own cathedral. While he presided overthis province, he obtained for himself and his successors,the then very important privilege of the admiraltyof Dalkey, as fully mentioned at that locality inthe History of the County of Dublin."THOMAS Charley. 151THOMAS Crawley.[Succ. 1397. Ob. 1417.]Thomas Cranley, of the Carmelite order, a nativeof England, Doctor of Divinity, Fellow of MertonCollege, Warden of New College, and for a timeChancellor of the University of Oxford, was, on thedeath of Archbishop Northalis, appointed his successor.He appears to have been consecrated in1397? although he did not arrive in Dublin untilthe October of the following year, when he came incompany with the Duke of Surrey, Lord Lieutenantof Ireland. He then also filled the influential officeof Lord Chancellor of this country. In 1398 he hadletters of protection on proceeding to foreign partsin the service of the king,* and in the following yearhad power to treat with the Irish. t In 1401 he wasagain appointed Lord Chancellor, and in the sameyear the clergy and commons of his diocese granteda subsidy of eighty marks for the use of the stateIn 1403, in consequence of the illness of thisprelate, the king empowered the Master of the Rollsto exercise the office of chancellor as his deputy.In 1405, by reason of his being so much employedin state affairs, as not to be able to attend at the placeswhere assizes were to be held, the king authorizedthe Chief Justice and the second Justice of the benchto preside at the same in his place.|| The imme-Rymer s Foedera. f Rot.

At the close ofthis year, the archbishop was Lord Justice of Ireland,at which latter period, Leland the antiquary says,he wrote a neat epistle to the king, in elegant verse,consisting of 106 lines, which I read with great pleasure,and was at the pains of treasuring up in mymemory."In 1416, on the departure of Lord Carnival forEngland, he constituted this prelate his deputy inthe government of Ireland, as he was so empoweredto do by his commission,* and honourable mentionof his conduct in that trust was made by the Irishmemorialists of the day. About the end of April1417 5 he went into England, where he died atAbingdon, on the 25th of May following, in theeightieth year of his age, and not more full of yearsthan honours. His body was conveyed to Oxford, andthere interred in New College of which he had beenthe first warden. A monument was erected thereinfor him, being "a fair stone, adorned with brassplates, bearing the figure of a bishop clothed in hissacred vestments, over whom the armorial of thesee of Dublin are placed with his own ;" beneath isRot. Claus, in Cane, Hib.RICHARD TALBOT. 153an inscription in barbarous latin, which Harris hascopied, as also another that runs round the side ofthe stone. " He was a prelate," as Leland says, " inhigh reputation for his wit and pen ;" while Marie-burghwrites, "he was liberal, and fond of almsdeeds, a profound clerk, and doctor of divinity, anexcellent preacher, and a great builder and improverof such places as fell under his care. He was fair,magnificent, of a sanguine complexion, and tall ofstature, so that in his time it might be said to him,thou art fair beyond the children of men, grace isdiffused through thy lips because of thy eloquence ; "endowments which rendered him justly dear to thethree successive kings, during whose reigns he lived.RICHARD TALBOT.[Sue. 1417. Ob. 1449.]Richard Talbot, his successor, was descended froma noble family, and brother to that celebrated warriorJohn Talbot, Lord of Carnival, whom King Henrythe Sixth, for his great valour and faithful servicesin France, dignified with the titles of Earl of Shrewsbury,Waterford, and Wexford. In 1407 he wascollated to the precentorship of Hereford, and in1416 was elected to the primacy of Armagh, after thedeath of Archbishop Fleming ; but, having neglectedto expedite his confirmation in due time,John Swain was promoted thereto in his place. Inthe following year (1417), he was consecrated archbishopof this see, as may be seen in the White154 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.Book of Christ Church, compiled in the sixteenthcentury by Thomas Fitch, sub-prior of that cathedral.In 1423 he was Lord Justice, and subsequentlyLord Chancellor of Ireland, and in 1424 had a grantfor his services, of all the estates of Matthew St. Johndeceased, being in the hands of the king by reasonof the death of said Matthew and the minority of hisheir William St. John, to hold same, together with themarriage of said heir, and so from heir to heir, untilsome one should attain age, and have livery of saidestates. He was also constituted at this time a justiceand guardian of the peace within the countyof Dublin, with various powers. In 1425, on accountof his being daily engaged journeying in theLord Deputy s suite, he assigned the Chief Justice,and the second Justice of Ireland, to hold the assizeswithout the great seal, saving, however, the fees ofsaid seal.*In 1426 he reduced the proxies, that were formerlypaid by the prior and convent of the HolyTrinity to the Archbishops of Dublin, from fivemarks, to two and an half, which concession PopeEugene afterwards confirmed, in the seventh year ofhis pontificate, by a bull still preserved among thearchives of Christ Church.

In the same year Talbot had a royalmandate, reciting, that the king was led to understand,that several of his Irish subjects, arrayed andin arms, held unlawful meetings and traversed thecountry from place to place, causing various damagesto the king and his subjects, all which ill doings thisprelate was alleged to aid and abet ; he was thereforecommanded forthwith to put a stop to such meetings,and without fail, to appear before his majestyand his council at an early day, there to answer suchmatters as might be charged against him.JIn 1431 the king granted to him the custody oftwo-thirds of the manor of Trim, and of certain otherpremises, being in the crown by reason of the minorityof Richard Duke of York, and in the sameyear, with the consent of the prebendary of Swordsand of the two chapters of the diocese, he instituted aRot. in Cane. Hib. f Ik.156 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.new corporation within the cathedral of St. Patrick s,consisting of six minor canons, and six choristers :the former were to be presbyters ; of these he designatedthe first in rank by the title of sub-dean,and the second by that of succentor ; they were not,however, to have a voice in the chapter, or any fixedstall in the choir. For the support of this body, heallocated the tithes of the parish of Swords, exceptsuch portions as were specially reserved to the prebendaryand perpetual vicar ; the two elder canonswere to receive six marks yearly, over and above thestipend of ten marks allowed annually to each of theother four ; each of the choristers were to have fourmarks of English money, while twenty from theresidue were reserved to the precentor for life ; but,after his death, the whole of such residue was appropriatedfor ever to lighting the altars, and otheruses of the cathedral.* He also established a chantryin St. Michael s church, which, from being a chapelhe constituted parochial, and likewise, founded thechantry of St. Anne in St. Audeon s church, forthe maintenance of six priests, to pray for the king,and the founder, and their successors, and procureda licence to purchase in mortmain to the extent of66 135, 4d. per annum for its endowment.In 1432 it is recorded that Thomas Chace havingin the presence of the Lord Deputy, in the chapterroom of the house of the Dominicans, presentedletters patent, by which he was appointed LordMason s St. Patrick s, p. 83.RICHARD TALBOT. 157Chancellor, to this prelate, and having requiredfrom him the delivery of the great seal, the archbishop,conceiving the letters patent did not sufficientlysubstantiate such an intention, declined giving upsame, but consigned them to the custody of the LordDeputy until the king s will should be, as it so afterwardswas, better ascertained.* In 1435, and in thethree following years, the Archbishop of Armaghhaving been summoned to attend parliaments to beheldin the province of Leinster, made similar returnsof being impeded by this prelate as he had in1429. In 1436 Archbishop Talbot acted as deputyto Sir Thomas Stanley, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,and about the year 1440 caused certain processesand apostolic bulls, in favour of the four orders ofmendicants, to be published at the high cross of theCity of Dublin as so specially directed by the pope.In the same year he was again Lord Deputy of Ireland,and as such presided at a parliament heldthere. {In 1442 and 1443 similar assertions of primatialauthority occur as mentioned at 1 42(). About the closeof the former year Talbot was despatched by the parliamentof Ireland to King Henry the Sixth, togetherwith the superior of St. Mary s Abbey, with a jointcommission to instruct his Majesty on the state ofaffairs in that kingdom. In 1443, on the death ofJohn Prone, he was elected Archbishop of Armaghby the dean and chapter of that see, but upon hisRot. Pat. in Cane. Hib. f Rot. Claus. in Cane.

In 1445 he was a fourth time Lord Deputyof Ireland, and in 1447 was appointed deputy to theEarl of Ormond, Viceroy of Ireland. In 1446,and the three following years, similar assertions ofprimatial authority occur as mentioned in 1429.Having sat in this see almost thirty-two years,during all which time he was of the privy council, toKing Henry the Fifth and King Henry the Sixth,he died on the 15th of August, 1449, and was buriedin St. Patrick s Church before the steps of the altar,under a marble monument adorned with his portraiturecut in brass, a mitre on his head, and a pastoralstaff in his hand ; some fragments of which, Harrissays, were remaining in his day, with an inscription,which Ware has preserved. The temporalities of thesee were upon his decease committed to Sir WilliamWelles, knight. Archbishop Talbot was the authorof a work entitled " De abuse regiments JacobiComitis Ormoniae, dum esse locum tenens Hibernianwhich subject a contemporary of his, Giles Thornton,Treasurer of Ireland, also wrote. Those pamphletswere but introductory to hostile designs againstthe Earl of Ormond, when Thomas Fits Thomas,Prior of Kilmainham, supported by this archbishop,and by the Lord Treasurer, went to England toaccuse him of high treason. The combat was, thereupon,awarded between them to take place at Smithfieldin London, but the king interposed and preventedthe rencontre.

Ob. 1471.]Before the close of the year in which ArchbishopTalbot died, Michael Treasury, a native of the villageof Treasury in Cornwall, (whence his family derivedthe surname), Doctor of Divinity in the university ofOxford, sometime Fellow of Exeter college there,and chaplain to the King, was consecrated in St.Patrick s church archbishop of this province, havingtherewith, as his predecessor had, the deanery ofPenkridge in Staffordshire, before alluded to. Hewas even at a much earlier period esteemed of suchgreat eminence for learning and wisdom, that in theyear 1418 King Henry the Fifth invited him over toCaen in Normandy, to take upon him the governmentof a college which that monarch had foundedthere, Henry at the same time selecting the professorsthereof from the mendicant friars. Treasuryaccepted this trust, and for a considerable time dischargedit with well-merited applause, both for hispublic lectures and his writings, a catalogue of whichmay be seen in Bale and Pits.His life, during the period of his prelacy, waschiefly passed in such scenes of repose, or strictlyWare s Writers, p. 323.160 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.ecclesiastical employments, as leaves little of popularnote for history to commemorate. In 1450 he hadrestitution of the temporalities of his see, with theusual renunciation clause of any benefit in the bullof his promotion prejudicial to the crown. He wascalled into the Privy Council immediately, and had20 per annum granted him by the king for hisgood counsel, being the salary which his predecessors,Archbishops of Dublin, who Were of the council, hadbeen accustomed to receive. In 1451 the libertiesof his see were, on inspeximus and by the authorityof a great council held at Drogheda, and thence adjournedto Dublin, again confirmed to him and hissuccessors for ever. In the same year, according tothe Registry of the Dominican monastery in Dublin,above fifty persons went out of this diocese to Rome,to celebrate the jubilee then held under Pope Nicholasthe Fifth, to whom this prelate gave recommendatorycertificates. So great was the concourse and hardshipof the pilgrimage, that seven of the numberwere pressed to death in the crowd, and many moredied of fatigue on their return. In accordance withthis account, Matthias Alterius, in his additions tothe Chronicle of Eusebius, says, " there was so greata gathering of people from all parts of the Christianworld at this jubilee, that at Adrian s mole almost200 perished in the press, besides many who weredrowned in the Tiber." They, who returned safe in1453, brought the melancholy news that Constantinoplewas taken by the Turks, and the EmperorConstantine Palaeologus slain ; Archbishop TreasuryMICHAEL TREGURY.was so afflicted at the account, that he proclaimed afast, to be strictly observed throughout his diocese forthree successive days, and granted indulgences tothose who observed it, while himself went before theclergy in procession to Christ Church, clothed insackcloth and ashes. At this period, it appearingthat the archiepiscopal crosier had been, on the deceaseof Archbishop Treasury and before the arrivalof Talbot, surreptitiously pledged for five marks,this prelate pronounced sentence, that, as the priorand convent of Christ Church had the honour andresponsibility of keeping it, they ought to release it;yet it appears, from the comment written by ArchbishopAllen in the time of Henry the Eighth, thatthis valuable ensign of authority continued unredeemedfor nearly eighty years : Verum ego Alan'sJohannes Septimus, (being the seventh John that wasArchbishop of Dublin,) propriis expenses recuperavitarn crucem quam baculum, dandy uncias ferme centumargenti de mens. Igitur orate pro anima mea."In 1453 the king, for the securing of an arrearof two years and an half due to this prelate and hisaccruing salary, granted him the custody of the manoror lordship of Saggard, and the town of Ballychize,parcel thereof, to hold same during the time heshould be archbishop.* In the same year he wastaken prisoner in the bay by pirates, who were carryingoff some ships from the harbour of Dublin ; theywere pursued, however, to Ardglass in the county ofRymer s Fcedera.M162 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.Down, where 520 of these sea-rovers were killed,and the prelate released. In 1454 all statutes againstprovisors in England and Ireland were confirmed bya new act, and directed to be enforced against allwho should sue " any provision upon any man beneficedwithin this land of Ireland, and by cause of theprovision enter into any benefice or benefices of theChurch, and take any goods or chattels from anybenefices of the Church against whom any provisionsare sued," under pecuniary penalties and treble damages; and in 1458 another act of parliament waspassed, to compel all persons holding benefices inIreland to reside in that country, under pain of forfeitureof all the issues and profits of their livings,a moiety thereof to be applied to the use of theirchurches, and the other moiety " to be expended inour sovereign lord the king s wars, in defence of thispoor land of Ireland." In 1461, on the occasion ofthis prelate going to England, he had licence to receive,for one year of absence, the tithes and otherprofits of his diocese, without incurring any penaltiesas an absentee.*There is extant in the Liber Niger of ChristChurch, a copy of a bull of Pope Pius the Second,dated the 23rd of November, 1462, and directed tothe Bishop and Archdeacon of Ossory, commandingthem to pronounce as excommunicated, GeoffreyHarold and two of his sons, Patrick Byrne, ShadySheriff, Robert Burnet and others, laymen of the cityRot.

These were, probably,some accessaries in the transaction mentioned anteat 1453.In 1467 the purchasing of Irish benefices fromRome, to hold in commendam, was by statute prohibitedunder all the penalties of the acts againstprovisors, with the additional enactment that no pardonor licence of the king should avail to excuse anyoneoffending therein, unless confirmed by parliament; and all letters patent of pardon from the provisors were declared void. In the same year,this prelate assigned a moiety of the parish of Luskfor the treasurer of St. Patrick s, and constituted therectory of St. Audeon in the city, a distinct prebend.In 1468 he held a visitation in the chapter-house ofSt. Patrick s cathedral ; on which occasion the generalarticles having been read, the dean reported thathe had visited the canons, petit canons, and vicarschoral, that all the prebends were visited, exceptTipperkevin, Tipper, Ballymore, Dunlavin, Yagoe,Donaghmore in Imayle, Stagonil, and Monmohenock,which lay in the Irish territory, or on the marches ofthe Pale, so that he dared not to visit them on accountof the war in those parts, and except alsoHowth and Mullaghiddart. He reported, moreover,that they were corrected by his visitation, were corrigibleand obedient; whereupon, after some questionsM 21(34 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.asked relative to the hospitality of the dean andcanons, the visitation was adjourned.* In the followingyear, on the occasion of his going to Englandon stale affairs, he had letters of protection prohibitingany to retard or molest him, &c.f5 Having presided over this see twenty-two years,he died in 14?1 (the 21st of December), at a veryadvanced age, at the manor-house of Tallagh, whichhe had previously repaired. His remains were conveyedto Dublin, attended by the clergy and citizens,and buried in St. Patrick s church near St. Stephen saltar, as he had directed by his will ; where, Warementions, " a specious monument" might have beenseen before his time, " adorned with his statue ofelegant workmanship," with inscriptions at head andfoot ; but which certainly were penned without muchinspiration from the Muses. This monument, Harrisadds, was found under the rubbish in St. Stephen schapel ; Dean Swift preserved the cover, and had itset up " in the wall on the left hand after enteringthe west gate, and between the said gate and theplace where theretofore the Consistory court washeld, while over it was placed the inscription, Vetushoc monumentum, e ruderibus capellae divi Stephennuper instauratae erutum, Deans et Capitulum huetransferred curaverunt. A. D. 1730." The will ofthis prelate, dated the 10th of December, 14/1, isextant among the manuscripts of Trinity College,Dublin. He thereby devised two silver gilt salt-masons St. Patrick s, p. 136. t Rymer s Foedera.MICHAEL TMEGUUY. 165cellars, with their covers, to be used as chalices inSt. Patrick s cathedral at the celebration of Mass.He, likewise, bequeathed a pair of organs to the saidchurch, to be used in St. Mary s chapel. " I devisealso," he adds, " that William Wyse, whose industryfor this purpose I choose, shall, in my stead, visitwith a decent oblation St. Michael s Mount in Cornwall,which by vow I am bound to perform eitherby myself or proxy ; and he also directed the sameindividual to make some donations towards buildingthe churches of that neighbourhood, " near which,"as he declares, " his friends dwell." He is said byBale to have written " Lectures in quatuor liberossententious ;" " De origine illus studio ;" " Ordinariesquaestiones ;* and other works.Immediately after his decease, John Allen,Dean of St. Patrick s, was elected archbishop by theunited suffrages of both cathedrals ; for, althoughthe convent of the Holy Trinity at first feared, lestthe displeasure of the crown might be incurred bynot waiting for a royal licence, and therefore refusedto hold an election, the chapter of St. Patrick s, havingexecuted a bond of indemnity to them for the sum of100, sealed with their common seal, induced theirperfect acquiescence. Nevertheless, although soelected by the voices of both chapters, Allen wasnot confirmed in the archbishopric, probably on accountof the informality, and John Walton, beingafterwards nominated by the king, received the pallin 1472.lOG ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.JOHN WALTON.[Succ. 1472. Resign. 1484.]John Walton, otherwise called John Monster,was the eighteenth Abbot of Osney, near Oxford, tothe government of which house he was advanced in1452, and in the year following obtained a licencefrom John Bishop of Lincoln, for him and his successors,and for their prebendal churches of Stow andSiberia, to wear a vestment called alicia, as it wasused in cathedrals in divine service; this article ofdistinction was lined with skins or furs, and morecommonly called "amos" from being worn on theshoulders. Stephens in his Monastic conjecturesthat he was the same John Walton, who supplicatedfor his degrees in divinity in 1451, the year beforehe was made Abbot of Osney, being previouslycanon of that house, and upon that supposition attributesto him the translation of " Boetius de consolation"into English verse, which is extant in manuscriptin Baliol College Library, Oxford. From theaforesaid abbacy he was advanced to the Archbishopricof Dublin, and was consecrated in Englandand adorned with the pall in 1472. On his arrivalin Ireland he endeavoured to exercise ordinary jurisdictionover the Dean and Chapter of St. Patrick s,but the dean insisted on his right to be ordinary inhis own cathedral ; and, when the archbishop deprivedhim, he petitioned parliament, and obtained a statuteconfirmatory of his privileges and those of his chapter.It may be remarked, that there is in the college ma-johnWALTON. 1G7manuscripts a registry of the wills of this diocese in1472.In 1473, on the occasion of a sequestration ofthe corbeship of Glendalough, he directed it thus :"Johannes moderation divine Dubliniensis Archiepiscopalet Hibernian Primae, clericus, vassals, adscriptitiiset alias habitations villas et toties domini nostri deGlendalache,terrarum,sylvarum,nemorum et alterumdecorum ipsius maner nostri, sal utem,gratiam etbene-dictionary"* &c. In 1475, at the instance of theDominicans and other regulars, Pope Sixtus theFourth issued his bull, wherein, reciting the abundanceof teachers but the deficiency of schools inIreland, and the consequently rarely embraced andexpensive consequences of foreign education, hesanctioned the establishment of a university in Dublinfor the study of the arts and theology, and the conferringof the usual degrees therein. f In 1476 ArchbishopWalton had a confirmation, by the award ofthe Bishop of Meath, of fourteen marks for proxiesfrom the Abbey of St. Thomas, for every year hevisited in person the said abbey and the churchesunited to it.J Yet not until 1477 does he appear tohave obtained formal restitution of the temporalitiesof his see.In 1478, on the petition of this prelate, an act ofparliament passed, whereby some lands of the archbishopric,which had been partly let out to farm, andReg-list. Arch. Dublin.t De Burgo Hib. Dom. p. 193. J Id. p. 195.1G8 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.partly alienated by Talbot and Treasury, were restoredto the see ; the exemplification of the act ispreserved in the Black Book of Christ Church.Another statute, of the same session, seems to havelaid the foundation of the Archbishop of Dublinbeing always of his Majesty s Privy Council. Theact recited that a doubt existed, whether in the caseof any sudden vacancy in the office of Chief Governor,the election of a temporary Deputy should be madeby the Privy Council, or by all the lords spiritualand temporal and the more honourable of the threeadjoining counties ; and it enacts, that it shall be bythe council, the Archbishops of Dublin and Armagh,the Bishops of Meath and Kildare, the mayors ofDublin and Drogheda, and the lords spiritual andtemporal of parliament of the four counties, Dublin,Kildare, Meath, and Louth, or the greater part ofthem. About the same time this prelate, as ArchbishopAllen suggests in the " Repertorium Viride,"annexed the perpetual vicarage of St. Kevin to hischoral vicar of the prebend of Cullen, and said vicaraccordingly appeared in the choir habited as a minorcanon, in token of his pre-eminence.In 1484, being blind and in an infirm state ofhealth, he voluntarily resigned the archbishopric,reserving to himself for a maintenance the manorof Swords during his life ; a saving which wasconfirmed to him in the following year by act ofparliament duly enrolled. A short time previousto his resignation, he terminated a long litigation,which had existed between the see and the prior andJOHN WALTON. 1(39convent of Holmpatrick, the particulars of which maybeseen at that locality in the " History of the Countyof Dublin."Upon the resignation of Archbishop Walton,Gerald, Earl of Kildare, then Lord Deputy, forciblyentered into and took possession of twenty-four town-landsbelonging to this see, in the lordships of Bally-moreand Castlekevin, and held them to the time ofhis death. Possibly, these were the lands alienatedby Talbot and Treasury before mentioned, and whichwere restored by act of parliament. His immediatesuccessor, Archbishop Fits Simon, never took anysteps for their recovery, although he was a man ofpower, Chancellor and Lord Deputy, and filled thesee during twenty-seven years ; Fits Simon s successor,William Ilokeby, in 1514 petitioned Gerald,Earl of Kildare (son of the former), and the councilfor a restitution, whereupon, the matter was referredto Patrick Bermingham and Richard de la Horde,justices, and Bartholomew Dillon, Chief Baron; who,in two years afterwards made an award in favour ofthe archbishop, and the see was restored to its rightsafter a dispossession of about thirty two years, butthe house of Kildare, still laying claim to these lands,again forcibly seized upon them, and Harris says hesaw a petition of Archbishop Inge to the Earl ofSurrey, when Lord Lieutenant, against Thomas FitsGerald, complaining of this force, and praying restitution,which was decreed in his favour on the 21stof December, 1521 ; and it would appear that thesee has had undisturbed possession of them eversince.170 ARCHBISHOPS OF Dublin.In 1489, five years after he had vacated the see,emerging from the obscurity and repose which onlyhis age and infirmities necessitated, he again appearedin the pulpit of his cathedral, and preached at St.Patrick s church on the festival of its patron, beforethe Lord Deputy and the nobles, to the admirationof the hearers. He was led thence to the archbishop spalace, where he dined with the chief men of theState. The Registry of Swords gives an account ofthis and two other sermons preached by him whenhe was blind, and speaks of him in terms of highcommendation, especially for his hospitality and hischeerful and innocent disposition. The precise timeof his death has not been ascertained, but his willwithout date is extant among the manuscripts inTrinity College, Dublin. He therein ordered hisbody to be buried at Osney, among its abbots, if hedied in England, directed one portiforiuin (an ecclesiasticalbook), with the Mass-book and a book calledpupilla oculi" to be restored to that abbey, togetherwith the following articles : viz. one silver cup with agilded cover, one white cup with a cover, and twosilver bolbecis, a silver gilt salt-cellar with a giltcover, a double neck-cloth of diaper, two long diapertowels, and three short ones of the same sort, a largehanging branch for four candles, of tin, four othercandlesticks of tin, ten jackets, two pair of vestmentsof green damask, six rochets, and other particulars ;and he also bequeathed to the said abbey, two booksof physic, twelve silver spoons, a feather bed, bolster,and four pillows.WALTER FITZ SIMON. 171WALTER Fits-SIMON.[Succ. 1484. Ob. loll.]Walter Fits-Simon succeeded. He was a bachelorof the civil and canon laws, a learned divine andphilosopher, precentor of St. Patrick s church, whosechapter he represented as proxy in a parliament of1478. He was also official of the diocese of Dublin.On the 14th of June, 1484, Pope Sixtus the Fourthappointed him for this see, upon which he was, withthe king s licence, consecrated in St. Patrick s cathedral,on the 26th of September following. On thepreceding day, the dean, chancellor, and treasurer,had solicited the consent of the prior and convent ofthe Holy Trinity, that this ceremony should takeplace in St. Patrick s ; but they were refused, inconsequenceof which, a dispute took place that lasteduntil evening ;* on the following day, however, thesacred ceremony was permitted to be solemnized inthe place required. In the same year an act waspassed, reciting that divers benefices of this diocese,the advowsons of which belonged to the archbishopin right of his see, " were situated amongst Irishenemies, and, as no Englishmen could inhabit thesaid benefices, and divers English clerks, who wereenabled to have cure of souls, were not expert inthe Irish language, and such of them as were, disdainedto inhabit amongst the Irish people, andothers dared not, by which means divine service wasMason s St. Patrick s, p. 139.17*2 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.diminished, and the cure of souls neglected ;" it wastherefore enacted, that this prelate might for twoyears collate Irish clerks to the said benefices, withoutany impeachment from the king, his heirs, officers,or ministers, any act to the contrary notwithstanding,(such beneficed clergy being sworn to allegiance), aprivilege which it was found necessary to renew toFits Simon in 1493.In 1487 this prelate was one of the deluded, whoespoused the cause of Lambert Simnel and wereaccessary to his coronation in Christ Church ; accordingly,his holiness on the 9th of January, 1487?directed his bull to the Archbishops of Cashel andTuam, and the Bishops of Clogher and Ossory,reciting, that he had been informed, that the Archbishopsof Armagh and Dublin, and the Bishops ofMeath and Kildare, were not ashamed to adhere tothe king s enemies, and to proclaim and crown apretender, contrary to their true allegiance. Thepontiff, therefore, directed an inquiry into the charge,and a full and explicit report in relation thereto, thathe might, with the advice of the cardinals, proceedagainst the offenders, according to the canons. ThePrimate of Armagh was, however, wholly innocentof the charge, but the other three were publiclyguilty. Such indeed was the credulity with whichthe impostor was received in Ireland, that even theLord Deputy of the day, the Earl of Kildare, and thecouncil received him with open arms, and the peopleunanimously declared in his favour. He was carriedin state to the Castle of Dublin, in a few days pro-walterFITZ SIMON. 173claimed king, and crowned in Christ Church, by thename of Edward the Sixth ; whereupon, he conveneda parliament, in which laws were made, subsidiesgranted, and attainders passed as usual inIreland. The contrite petition of the mayor andcitizens of Dublin to Henry the Seventh, evinceshow powerfully this prelate s example influenced theirconduct on this occasion. " We were daunted," saythey, " not only to see your chief governor, whomyour highness made ruler over us, to bend or bowto that idol whom they made us to obey, but alsoour father of Dublin, and most of the clergy of thenation, except the Reverend father his Grace Octavian,Archbishop of Armagh." In 1488, however,Fits Simon was permitted amongst several torenew his allegiance, and receive pardon throughSir Richard Edgecombe, while the Earl of Kildaretook the oath more solemnly in the church of St.Thomas s Abbey, " holding his right hand over theholy host ; the Archbishop of Dublin, when the masswas ended in the choir of said church, began TeDeum, and the choir with the organs sung it upsolemnly, and at that time all the bells in the churchrang"*In 14Q2 this prelate was made deputy to JasperDuke of Bedford, in lieu of Gerald Earl of Kildare,and the appointment was ratified by the king.While in this situation, he endeavoured to effectuateindustrious habits amongst the more indolent of theHarris s Hibernia, Part 1, p. 33.174 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.people, and represented to his sovereign, " how idlythe younger sons of rich families spent their time,who learned no trade, nor qualified themselves bystudy for any liberal profession, but lived in a stateof dependance on the elder brother or head of thefamily, and so became useless to the commonwealth ;and as for the bulk of the common people, they livedin sloth and indolence, on account of the great plentyof all kinds of provisions that the land naturally produced,and for this they neglect to labour ; that itis greater charity to find work for them, than to relievethem from door to door, for that the one isacceptable to God, profitable to the commonwealth,and healthful to the body ; whereas, idleness is theroot of all evil." Upon the receipt of this letterHenry immediately issued orders, " that none shouldbe suffered to wander about the cities, towns, orboroughs of Ireland, without a certificate from themayor, bailiff, or seneschal of the places where theywere born, by which means, every town kept theirown poor, and a workhouse was erected in everyparish, town, or borough, for the vagabonds to workin. The archbishop appointed beadles for this purpose,to look after the several cities, towns, andparishes, to keep beggars out, and to take up straingers"* In the following year (1493), Fits Simonheld a parliament at Dublin, in which all the inquisitionsbefore that time found against him, on theinstigation of Roland Lord Dorchester, were declaredCouncil Books, temp. Hen. VII.WALTER FITZ SIMON. 175void, while at the same session, all grants, annuities,leases, &c., made by this prelate and his three immediatepredecessors, were annulled, and resumed tothe church. Being removed in this year from theoffice of deputy, he immediately passed into England,to lay before the king a full account, as well of hisown government as of the state of this kingdom,which was followed by the impeachment of the Earlof Kildare. Before leaving Ireland, he deliveredhis crosier to Richard Skerrit, Prior of ChristChurch, to whom its custody appertained. Fromthis expedition he returned to his province with ampletestimonials of the royal satisfaction, and subsequentlygrew into so much greater favour andfamiliarity with Henry, that Richard Stanyhurstsays of him,* that being present when an orationwas pronounced in his praise, that monarch, when itwas concluded, inquired from the archbishop, whathe found most material in his speech. The archbishopreplied, if it pleaseth your highness, it picas-ethme, I find no fault, save only that lie flatteredyour majesty too much. Now in good faith, saidthe king, our father of Dublin ! we were minded tofind the same fault ourselves.In the parliament of 1495 all the statutes theretoforepassed, as well in England as in Ireland,against provisors to Rome, were confirmed, anddirected " to" be from thenceforth duly and straightlyDe Rebus Hibernian.176 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.executed in all points within the said land, accordingto the effect of the same."In 1496 the king having appointed his son,Henry Duke of York, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,and " greatly desiring," as the record states, " thatin his absence and youth justice might in all particularsbe administered in the right track, and confidingin the allegiance, diligence, integrity, conscience,experience, and learning of this Archbishop," appointedhim Lord Chancellor of said kingdom, &c.*In the same year Fits Simon held a provincial synodin the Church of the Holy Trinity, on which occasionan annual contribution for seven years wassettled by the clergy of the province, to providesalaries for the lecturers of the university in St.Patrick s Cathedrals On the 19th of May in thefollowing year, he granted to John Allen, Dean ofSt. Patrick s, licence to build an hospital for the reliefof the poor, and assigned to him a large space ofground in Kevin-street for that purpose, the archbishopreserving to himself and his successors fullpower of appropriating two beds within this receptacle; and all the poor therein lodged being requiredto pray for his soul, as a principal founder, and forthe souls of the dean, his friends and successors, forever.This establishment was not intended for thepoor indiscriminately, but it was prescribed that thoseonly should be admissible who were good Catholics, ofRymer s Foedera. t Allen s Registry, f, 105.WILLIAM FITZ SIMON 1 . 177honest conversation, without reproach, of Englishnation, and chiefly from the families of Allen, Barret,Beg, Hill, Dillon, and Rogers, settlers in the diocesesof Dublin and Meath ; and out of those classesthe Dean and Chapter of St. Patrick s were to havethe right of selection without fee or reward.*On the 30th of the same month, Friar DenisWhite, who had for several years usurped the dioceseof Glendalough, being old and infirm, surrenderedit in the chapel house of St. Patrick s, Dublin,being touched in conscience," as he confessed,because the see of Glendalough had been unitedto that of Dublin from the reign of King John ;" andever since that surrender the archbishops of Dublinhave without interruption enjoyed the see. Yet it isto be remarked, that de Burgos mentions the advancementof Doctor Francis de Cordova thereto by thePope s permission. The history, however, of thislatter diocese is not within the scope of these memoirs.In 1508 Fits Simon was deputy to Gerald Earlof Kildare, to whom he resigned the sword in theAugust of the same year. In 1507 he was instrumentalin obtaining from the king a charter of incorporationfor the carpenters, millers, heifers, andtilers of the metropolis; and in 1509 was againLord Chancellor.Having filled this see during twenty-seven years,he died on the 14th of May, 1511, at Finglas nearMason s St. Patrick ?, p. 142. t Hib. Dom, p. 479.NARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.Dublin, whence his body was conveyed to St. Patricks Church, and there honourably interred in thenave : Harris characterizes him as a prelate of greatgravity and learning, and of a graceful presence, ableto strike those who beheld him with reverence ; headds, that after his death, Richard Skirret, Prior ofChrist Church, according to custom, took the archiepiscopalcross into his custody, to be kept for theuse of his successor.WILLIAM ROKEBY.[Slice. 1511. Ob. 1521.]William Rokeby, the succeeding archbishop, wasa native of a locality of the same name in Yorkshire,which Sir Walter Scott has, perhaps, yet more distinguished.He was a doctor of the canon law, andbrother to Sir Richard Rokeby, Lord Treasurer ofIreland. The rudiments of his education are saidto have been acquired at the school of Rotherham,whence he was removed to an ancient hostel for thereception of canonists in Lydgate parish, London.He was afterwards at Oxford, and, when very young,was presented by the monks of Lewes in 1487 to therectory of Sandal, near Doncaster, his constant residencein which may be inferred from the attachmenthe appears to have felt for it, even choosing it for hisburial-place, and for the celebration of those sacred riteswhich he directed should for ever attend his commemoration.At the close of the fifteenth century, hewas by his former patrons, the monks of Lewes,nominated to the vicarage of Halifax, in Yorkshire ;WILLIAM ROKEBY. 17Qin 1498 was constituted Lord Chancellor of Ireland,and afterwards advanced to the see of Meath, by PopeJulius the Second in 1507, whereupon he took hisseat in the Privy Council. On the 5th of February,1511, he was by the same Pope "released from thetie which bound him to Meath" and translated tothis see, the temporalities of which were upon the23rd of June following restored to him.In January, 1514, disputes, which had for a longtimeexisted between the successive Archbishops ofDublin and the dean and chapter of St. Patrick s, relativeto ecclesiastical jurisdiction, were brought to afinal compromise ; the terms of which are fully setforth in Mr. Mason s valuable History of St. Patrick sCathedral, (p. 143.) About the year 1515, DoctorRokeby was made Chancellor of Ireland by KingHenry the Eighth, an office which he seems to havefilled during the remainder of his life. In 1518 heconvened a provincial synod, whose canons are yetextant in the Red Book of the church of Ossory, andhave been published thereout by Sir Henry Seaman.*They particularly enjoined the due examinationof persons from Connaught and Ulster previousto admission to the priesthood; the payment of tithes,proxies, and burial dues; the discontinuance of tinchalices at the celebration of the Mass ; the appraisementof the goods of intestate by two valuations appointedby the bishop ; prohibited the disposal of theproperty of the Church by laymen without the con-cecilia,T. ii. p. 726.N3ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.currency of the clergy ; the playing of football byclergymen, under the penalty of 3s. 4d. to the ordinary,and 3s. 4d. to the repair of the parish church ;and directed that no lay exactions should be chargedon glebes, except by royal authority. In the sameyear, this prelate confirmed the establishment of acollege of clerks founded at Maynooth by GeraldEarl of Kildare, which he subsequently new modelled,having united the prebend to the mastership of thecollege, and the vicarage with the office of sub-master;and likewise added several rules for the governmentof the establishment.* In 1520 he was despatchedby the Lord Deputy and Council to Waterford, " forthe pacifying of such discords, debates, and variances,as existed betwixt the Earl of Desmond and SirPiers Butler." " And right comfortable news itshould be unto us," writes King Henry to his viceroy,alluding thereto, " to hear and understand of agood concord betwixt them, so that they, being sopacified, might with their puissances join and attendpersonally with and upon you, our lieutenant, foryour better assistance in repressing the severities ofour rebellious Irish enemies Now, at thebeginning, politic practices may do more good thanexploit of war, till such time as the strength of theIrish enemy shall be enfeebled and diminished, aswell by getting their captains from them, as by puttingdivision among them, so that they join not together.^Mason s St. Patrick s Cathedral, p. 144.t State Papers, temp.

On the day of his decease,the archiepiscopal crosier was, according to custom,sent to the prior of Christ Church, to be kept duringthe vacancy of the see. His body was immediatelyafter his decease sent over to England, according tothe direction of his will made six days before hisdeath ; an abstract of which is given in the AthenaOxonienses. He therein styles himself Archbishopof Dublin, and perpetual vicar of Halifax, and ordersthat when dead he should be embowered, and hisbowels and heart buried in the church of Halifax,in the choir, and his body in his new chapel at Sandal,a fabric of singular beauty, and perhaps the mostperfect existing specimen of what the sepulchral chapelsof former times used to be; and he directed thattherein a tomb of stone should be made, with a suitableinscription, and that also a chapel should bebuilt at Halifax, on the south side of the church,under the inspection of his executors and the churchwardens,and that therein another tomb should beconstructed, with his image and a similar inscription.Item, whereas he had obtained an indulgence forthe parish of Halifax, and the parishes thereunto adjoining,for eating white meats in Lent, he willedthat his executors at their discretion should solicitfor a renewal of the said licence sub plumbs, the profitthereof to be employed on a priest to sing at182 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.Halifax, in his said new chapel, as long as may be bythe advice and discretion of his executors and thechurch wardens, and that a doctor of divinity haveten pounds to be occupied in preaching, &c." Inpursuance of this will, his heart was buried in thechancel of the church of Halifax, and a stone laidover it, with the figure only of a heart engraved uponit. The chapel was likewise founded, and a cenotapherected in it, on which is an inscription partlylegible, stating all his preferments and the date ofhis death. A monument was also erected to hismemory in the centre of the chapel of Sandal, whereinhis earthly remains were deposited, according to theaforesaid provisions of his will.*HUGH INGE.[Succ. 1521. Ob. 1528.]Hugh Inge, Doctor of Divinity, succeeded WilliamRokeby, twice by the Pope s appointment, firstin Meath, and secondly on his translation thence tothis dignity. He was born in Shelton Mallet inSomersetshire, educated in William of Wickham sschool at Winchester, made perpetual Fellow of NewCollege in Oxford in 1484, took his degrees there,and leaving it in 1496 travelled into foreign countries.On his return he was successively made prebendaryof East Harptree, sub-chanter of the church of Wells,warden of Wapulham in the diocese of Lincoln, ofHunter s South Yorkshire, vol. i. p, 200.JOHN INGE. 183Putting in Somersetshire by the presentation ofRichard the Abbot and the convent of Glastonbury,and of Weston, alias Sowed, by similar presentation.In 1504 he was in Rome, at which time he was oneof King Henry s orators selected to take the renunciationof all prejudicial clauses in the apostolic bullsfor the translation of Cardinal Hadrian to the sees ofBath and Wells, and his oaths of fealty and allegianceto that monarch. In April, 1511, he was incorporatedDoctor of Divinity at Oxford while he wasbeyond sea, and in 1512 was appointed Bishop ofMeath, a dignity which he filled during ten years.In 1521 he succeeded Rokeby, and in 1522 wasrestored to all the profits of the see, the possessionsof which in the county and city of Dublin weresought to be ascertained by an inquisition of the sameyear. In 1527 he was made Chancellor of Ireland,which office he administered to the day of his death,and wherein says Wood,* " he was accounted a personof great probity and justice;" while PolydoreVirgil, who calls him Hugo Hank, gives him thecharacter of " an honest man, and one who by manygood offices had got a great share of intimacy andfamiliarity with the Earl of Kildare ;" and adds, thathe put the kingdom in as good condition as the untowardnessof the wild Irish would suffer him." Herepaired the palace of St. Sepulchre, as his arms(says Ware), placed in the wall over the palace doorat the entrance from the public library, seem to testify,A theme Oxonienses, vol. ii. p. 732.184 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.and, having governed this see during six years, hedied in Dublin on the 3rd of August, 1528, and wasburied in St. Patrick s church.

Ob. 1534.]John Allen, or Alan, as he writes his own name,Doctor of Laws and Treasurer of St. Paul s, London,succeeded, and was consecrated in Christ Church,Dublin, on the 13th of March, 1528. He was educatedat Oxford, whence he removed to Cambridge,where he took his degree of Bachelor of Laws. In1507 he received the church of Sundrithe in thediocese of Kent. In 1510 was collated to thatof Addington in the same diocese, in which, onhis promotion to the deanery of Riseburgh, in1511, he was succeeded by the celebrated Erasmus.In 1515 he was made rector of South Lyndonin Essex, which he resigned in 1526, but previousthereto was employed by William Warham, Archbishopof Canterbury, as his agent at Rome toconduct his negotiations and business with the Pope ;he resided there nine years, and was created doctorof laws, either there or in some other university inItaly; and in 1525, while yet beyond the seas, wasincorporated doctor of laws in Oxford. On his returnhe was made chaplain to Cardinal Wolsey, Arch-johnALLEN. 185bishop of York, and commissary or judge of his legatinecourt, at which period he was accounted " theonly match for Stephen Gardiner, another of Wolseys chaplains, for avoiding of which emulation hewas preferred in Ireland"* Immediately previous,however, to that preferment, he was one of Wolsey sgreat abettors in procuring the dissolution of forty ofthe lesser monasteries, for the endowment of the cardinals colleges at Oxford and Ipswich, a project,which, as the learned Godwin, Bishop of Hereford,remarks, " like the gold of Tholouse, brought citherdestruction or some great calamity on all who touchedit." "Two of them," he adds, " fought a duel, one waskilled, and the other hanged, a third threw himselfheadlong into a well, a fourth, though a rich man,came after to beg his bread ; Wolsey was thrown outof the king s favour and died miserably, and thePope, who gave his consent to the dissolution, livedto see Rome taken and plundered by the Imperialarmy, himself and cardinals made prisoners, and becomethe sport and mockery of the licentious multitude."Wood is particularly severe upon this prelatefor his unworthy and base dealing in the dissolutionof Coventry priory in Northamptonshire. fIndeed, the calmest and most impartial observercannot recur to this period of history, without a feelingof horror at the consummation of royal robbery andsacrilege that attended it. The suppression of monasterieshas cast a shadow through centuries thatCampion. f Athena Oxonicnses, vol. ii. p. 742.186 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.have ensued, and the empire, even yet, stands withinits penumbra. Up to this period the extensive possessionsof these ecclesiastical communities were devotedwith an indiscriminate liberality, which, howeverpolitical economists may censure, was, undoubtedly,universally designed for the benefit and reliefof the people. The numerous parishes, that were annexedto their establishments (about one-fourth ofthe total in Ireland), were strangers to church ratesand vestry assessments. An adequate proportion oftheir tithes was set apart for all the purposes, whichafterwards became the pretext for these novel impositions.Rarely had they to contribute to the foundingof churches, the building of hospitals, or the endowmentof schools. They knew not the callouscancer of such a poor law system as succeeded themin the sister country. The magnificent evidences ofmonastic bounty are over the face of the land : thechurches the abbeys the colleges the schoolsthe hospitals the alms-houses still powerfully recordtheir generous consideration of all that could promotethe honour of God, the stability of virtue, the encouragementof learning, the comfort of the sick, andthe maintenance of the poor. Constantly residing intheir convents, in the centre of their estates, themonks are acknowledged to have been the best andmost indulgent landlords ; they afforded a readymarket for the produce of the vicinity, and expendedtheir whole rents amongst their tenants. They fedthe poor and the sick ; they extended hospitality tothe pilgrim and the stranger ; they educated theJOHN ALLEN. 187young and the fatherless ; they dispensed to the agedand friendless the consolations of temporal and eternalrefreshment; they introduced agriculture and manufactures; they fostered the nobler arts, and withal,they never shrunk from their responsibility, when theexigencies of the state and the people appealed totheir treasury. By their obligation of celibacy andthe other rules of their institution, they were withdrawnfrom that temptation these motives for exactionand aggrandizement, which mingle with the bestfeelings of the fathers of families.Suddenly, avarice and rapine were let loose uponthem, their possessions were confiscated, and theirpious acquisitions scattered abroad, their ornamentsand furniture torn down, their libraries consumed,their houses unroofed, their churches disconcerted.Perhaps, in all the range of calamities which humannature could incur, none can be imagined morestrikingly affecting, than the dissolution of an abbeymust have presented. How pathetically does theRoman historian describe the sufferings of the Albans,when they were driven from their ancientabodes, when their gates were broken down, andtheir walls laid prostrate, a licentious military rushingthrough their sanctuaries with fire and sword, andtheir own looks directed for the last time on thehomes of their childhood and their happiness, whilethe crash, and smoke, and dust of the ruin burstupon their sight and their hearing. Yet, all thesesufferings were endured by the unhoped monks ;but the former were allowed to rescue some consolsARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.nations from the ruin ; they had ties in life whichsurvived the destruction of their city, they carriedwith them their wives and their little children, theycould look in each other s face and weep theirsympathy, (prospectus alterum mutua moderationintegral lachrymal), and, amidst all their outcastwretchedness, the temples of their gods were spared ;but the unfortunate exiles of the monastery saw theheaviest refinements of sacrilege levelled against thetemples of the God of all, they felt the links of life,which in their circumstances are peculiarly local,severed at once, and yet more, they dared not murmurat the dispensation. They were driven forth,old and feeble, scattered and broken-hearted, overthe country that had theretofore witnessed theirhospitality and charity, and amidst the superaddedgroans and lamentations of those whom they hadonce cherished and succoured. The very charms ofscenery, the habitudes of time, the long associationsof piety, in a word all that was once attractive andendearing, became suddenly changed into bitternessand ashes.Their sufferings closed with a generation ; thecalamity, as it affected the country, has been fearfullyperpetuated. " When the abbey lands," writes Hume,were distributed among the principal nobility andcourtiers, they fell under a different management,the rents of farms were raised, while the tenantsfound not the same facility in disposing of the produce,the money was often spent in the capital, andthe farmers living at a distance, were exposed toJOHN ALLEN. 189oppressions from their new masters, or the stillgreater rapacity of their stewards." While, yetmore, the legislative enactments, that were necessitatedby the transfer of this property, sufficientlyindicate the acknowledged duties of the old proprietors; church rates and vestry acts flourished,and, while in England a code of regulations for therelief of the poor sprung into instantaneous maturity,the needy and destitute of the Irish population wereutterly consigned to the compassion of an alreadyotherwise overburdened resident community.The avowed and influential instrumentality ofAllow in those disgraceful acts of spoliation maywell justify the preceding remarks. It certainly soinfluenced the favour of Wolsey, that as well in gratitudefor his services, as in jealousy and oppositionto the Earl of Kildare, he effected his advancementin September, 1528, to this dignity. Allen in thesame month had restitution of the temporalities ofthe see, and all the profits thereof from the death ofhis predecessor, without payment of the accustomedfines, and was likewise appointed Lord Chancellor.In 1529 (3rd of September) he was confirmed bythe Pope in this see, and in 1530 held a consistoryin Dublin, the statutes of which are preserved inthe Black Book of Christ Church, where are alsodetailed the sandals and proxies then paid to thisprelate. In said year he established rules for regulatinghis metropolitan court in St. Patrick s church,where it had been hrkl from so early as the year1 ( JO ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.1220.* In 1531 Archbishop Allen, being still likewiseLord Chancellor, wrote a letter to Lord Cromwell,the following extracts from which may be interesting." For the which your gentle manners Igive you entire thanks, accordingly, no less now inheart, mouth, and writing, than I trust heretofore,if ever it fortune me to be able in deeds and actseffectually. In accomplishment whereof, and to theintent I may the sooner perform this my said unfeignedpromise, I must instantly require you (necessityfact libitum quod alias est illicitum), to movemy sovereign lord, the king s good grace, to giveunto me a prebend of 100 per annum, in comme n-dam, to maintain the state that his highness hathcalled me unto, being primate of his Church in Ireland,and chancellor of the same, without my merits andby obedience, against my will truly Andhere with us, I cannot have the forty mark fee of thechancellorship, now two years and a half past, noryet such money as I laid out upon the king s letters,as well for ships and mariners wages, as for reparationdone on the king s chancery, also his castle.Sir, afore God, I desire none translation, nor anymanner of benefice of cure, or yet of dignity, butonly (if it might please the king s highness to havesome compassion upon me) a prebend which shouldcause no murmur of absent from thence, wherebyI might keep a dozen yeomen archers in wages andlivery, when I lie in the marches upon the churchMason s St. Patrick s, p. 146.JOHN ALLEN. 191lands, to keep me in the king s service from his Irishenemies and English rebels So knowethGod, who may send you (when I am out of half mydebt) this next year, one hobby, one hawk, and oneLimerick mantle, which three things be all the commoditiesfor a gentleman s pleasure in these parties"*In July, 1532, he was displaced from the chanceryat the instance of Gerald Earl of Kildare, who,about the same time, was constituted deputy to HenryDuke of Richmond, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,which afforded an additional incentive for revivingthe old animosities between them, while the earl s useof power caused too many to sympathize with thearchbishop s feelings. They communicated their apprehensionsto each other, and at secret consultations,at which the removed chancellor always took the lead,resolved to represent what they deemed the misgovernmentof Kildare to his royal master. Accordinglyin 1533 this prelate was one of the PrivyCouncil, who signed a full representation of whatthey deemed grievances in Irish government, with aprayer for their redress. This singular documentdeplores " the great decay of this land, which is sofarfallen into misery, and brought into such ruin,that neither the English order, tongue, nor habit beused, nor the king s laws obeyed above twenty milesin compass ;" and, amongst other articles, recommendsa resumption of the king s revenues from a certainState Papers, temp.

It furtheradvises " that all the lords and gentlemen within thefour shires, that is to say, Dublin, Kildare, Meath,and Uriel (Louth), be compelled to obey the king slaws and all others as nigh as may be"* It also deploresthe immoderate taking of coin and livery withoutorder after men s own sensual appetites. " Item,the black rents and tributes, which Irishmen by violencehath obtained of the king s subjects, is a greatmischief, whereby they be enriched and strengthenedand the others greatly enfeeblished ; and yet, whenthe deputies go upon Irishmen by the aid of theking s subjects for redress of their nightly and dailyrobberies, they keep all they get to their own use,and restore nothing to the poor people. Item, anotherhurt is the committing the governance of thisland to the lords natives of the same, and the oftenchange of deputies." It also commented strongly onthe negligence of the king s officers in keeping therecords, their unskilful conduct in the exchequer,and above all impressed the necessity of sending toState Papers, temp.

In thesame year (1533) Archbishop Allen revived theold dispute concerning precedence with PrimateCramer, who had been in the previous year constitutedLord Chancellor on Allen s removal ; theresult, however, does not appear, and the immediatelysubsequent events put an end to all controversies concerningbearing the cross.In the commencement of the year 1534, in thearticles for the government of Ireland, it was " ordainedby the king and his most honourable council,that the lands of the spiritualty and benefices to allcommon charges of the country shall contribute, as thelands of the temporary are charged ; and all lords andother persons of the spiritualty shall send companiesto hastings and journeys in manner and form following:The Archbishop of Armagh, sixteen able archers orgunners, appointed for the war.The Archbishop of Dublin, twenty.&c. &c. &c."*It was at this period that the Earl of Kildare, whensummoned into England and directed to appoint adeputy, for whose loyalty he should be responsible,rashly selected for that high trust his eldest sonStale Papers, temp.

The imprudent youth was too easily excitedby these suggestions, and formally surrendering thesword and the insignia of vice-regal authority to theLord Chancellor in St. Mary s Abbey, he broke outinto open rebellion, gathering together a tumultuousmob of soldiers, laid siege to Dublin, and wasted thesurrounding country with fire and sword. ArchbishopAllen, with other lords and officers of state of his politicalopinions, affrighted at this convulsion, at firstsought shelter in the castle under the protection ofthe constable, but, fearful of the result of the siegewhich Fitzgerald meditated against it, and reflectingthat he of all others was most obnoxious to the rebels,the prelate took the resolution of flying into England,and actually embarked with that intent in avessel from the adjacent haven at Dame s- Gate. Bycontrary winds, however, the carelessness of the sailors,or, what seems more probable, the treachery ofthe pilot, he was stranded near Clontarf, whence heJOHN ALLEN. 1Q5immediately hurried to the mansion of Mr. Hollywoodof Artane, whose extensive hospitality he commemoratesin his Repertorium Viride. On theway, however, he was intercepted, or as some insist,on the following morning was dragged out of thehouse of his entertainer, and there, "feeble for ageand sickness, kneeling in his shirt and mantle, bequeathinghis soul to God, his body to the traitorsmercy"* he was, in the 58th year of his age, brutallymurdered in the presence of Lord Thomas, on the28th of July, 1534.Ware characterizes him as a man of hospitalityand learning, and a diligent inquirer into antiquities.He was the author of Epistola de Pallid significationactiva et passive," penned by him when he receivedthe pall, as also of a work, entitled " Deconsuetudinibus ac statutes in tuitoriis causis observances,"and other works He likewise compiled theLiber Niger, a mine of antiquarian treasure as regardsthis diocese, and the Repertorium Viride, containingan account of the state of the churches thereof in histime, besides other ecclesiastical tracts. Immediatelyafter his decease, Geoffrey Fyche, Dean of St. Patricks, and William Hansard, Prior of the Holy Trinity,were appointed guardians of the spiritualities ofthe see, while Thomas Lustre had a grant from thecrown of the office of seneschal of all the courts,Campion.

Five of his uncles, as aidingand abetting in his conspiracy, were hanged at Tyburn,cut down half alive and quartered. Gerald,however, the young brother of Lord Thomas, whohad been carried off to Italy, was by Edward theSixth restored to the principal part of his estate, byQueen Mary to the ancient honours of his family,and by act of parliament, in the time of Queen Elizabeth,wholly relieved from the corruption of bloodthat was consequent on the attainder of his family.GEORGE BROWNE.[Succ. 1535. Dear. 1554.]After a vacancy of a few months from the deathof Archbishop Allen, George Browne, an Augustinianfriar of London, provincial there of that order,and one distinguished by his preaching of the tenetsof the Reformation, was elected to fill this see, onthe king s especial recommendation, by the chapters ofChrist Church and St. Patrick s, and had the royalconfirmation on the 12th of March, 1535. On theday following a mandate issued, commanding Cranmer,Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Bishops of Rochesterand Salisbury, to invest him with the pallGEORGE BROWNE.and other archiepiscopal insignia, according to an actthen lately passed; and he having been thereuponconsecrated on the IQth of the same month, a writwas on the 23rd directed to the Lord Chancellor ofIreland, commanding him to issue his mandate to theescheats of the counties of Dublin, Meath, Louth,and Kildare, to restore the revenues of his see to thisprelate ; and on the same day, another writ issued tothe escheator of the county of Stafford, to give up tohim such temporalities of the archbishopric as laywithin his bailiwick, being only the free chapel ofGeneris, before alluded to.The rudiments of George Browne s educationwere received in the house of his order, near Holy-wellin Oxfordshire. In 1523 he supplicated for thedegree of bachelor of divinity, but it docs not appearthat he was then admitted ; having, however, afterwardstaken the degree of doctor of divinity insome university beyond sea, he was incorporated inthe same degree at Oxford in 1534, and subsequentlyat Cambridge.*As might be expected from the complexion of hissermons in London, he at once avowed, on his promotionto this dignity, his profession of the tenets of theReformation ; and, accordingly when Henry renouncedthe power and supremacy of Rome, the Lord ThomasCrumwell, then lord privy seal, and who exercised allthe rights annexed to the king s supremacy underthe title of vicar-general of England, wrote toChalmers Biog. Diet.198 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.Browne, signifying from his highness, (then termingthe king by that title), " that he was fallen absolutelyfrom Rome in spiritual matters within his dominionof England, and how it was his royal will and pleasureto have his subjects there in Ireland to obey hiscommands as in England," nominating, at the sametime, said George Browne " one of his commissionersfor the execution thereof This prelate s reply wascommunicated not long after in the following words :My most honoured lord, your humble servant,receiving your mandate as one of his highness s commissioners,hath endeavoured, almost to the dangerand hazard of this temporal life, to procure the nobilityand gentry of this nation to due obedience inowning of his highness their supreme head, as wellspiritual as temporal, and do find much oppugningtherein, especially by my brother, Armagh, who hathbeen the main oppugner, and so hath withdrawnmost of his suffragans and clergy within his see andjurisdiction. He made a speech to them, laying acurse on the people whosoever should own his highnesss supremacy, saying, that isle, as it is in their Irishchronicles, " insula sacra," belongs to none but the Bishopof Rome, and that it was the Bishop of Rome thatgave it to the king s ancestors. There be two messengersby the priests of Armagh and by that archbishopnow lately sent to the Bishop of Rome. Your lordshipmay inform his highness, that it is convenient tocall a parliament in this nation to pass the supremacyby act, for they do not much matter his highness scommission, which your lordship sent us over. ThisGEORGE BROWNE. 1Q9island hath been for a long time held in ignoranceby the Romish orders, and as for their secular orders,they be in a manner as ignorant as the people,being not able to say mass or pronounce the words,they not knowing what they themselves say in theRoman tongue. The common people of this isle aremore zealous in their blindness, than the saints andmartyrs were in truth at the beginning of the gospel.I send to you, my very good lord, these things,that your lordship and his highness may consultwhat is to be done. It is feared, O Neill will beordered by the Bishop of Rome to oppose yourlordship s order from the king s highness, for thenatives are much in numbers within his powers. Tdo pray the Lord Christ to defend your lordshipfrom your enemies"*The prelate s advice for convening a parliamentwas warmly approved of by the king : previous, however,to its assembling, Lord Leonard Grey, as Sir JohnDavis states, in order " to prepare the minds of thepeople to obey the laws, began forthwith a martialcourse, making a victorious circuit round about thekingdom The principal septs of the Irishryrybeing all terrified, and most of them broken on theirjourney; many of their chief lords, upon this deputys return, came to Dublin and made their submissionto the crown of England This preparationbeing made, he first propounded and passedin parliament those laws, which made the great altera-harleighMiscellany, vol. v.200 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.tion in the " state ecclesiastical." It met in 1537,and, after passing an act of attainder against the Earlof Kildare and the associates of his rebellious son,proceeded to adjust the right of succession to thecrown of England and lordship of Ireland. It thenpronounced the marriage of the king with Catherineof Arragon to be clearly and absolutely against thelaws of God, and utterly void and annihilated, andthe sentence of separation by the Archbishop of Canterburyto be good and effectual ; that, therefore, themarriage between his highness and his most dear andentirely beloved wife, Queen Anne, should be establishedtrue, sincere, and perfect ever hereafter, accordingto the just judgment of the Archbishop ofCanterbury, " confirmed as it was by the wholeclergy of England, both the universities thereof, theuniversities of Bologna, Padua, Paris, Orleans, Tholouse,Anjou, and divers others, and also, by the privatewritings of many right excellent well learnedmen." The inheritance of the crown was also bythis assembly declared to be in the king and hisheirs by Queen Anne, and it was pronounced hightreason to oppose this line of succession, misprision oftreason to slander it, and an oath of allegiance wasprescribed to be taken by the subjects of Ireland, forits better and more universal enforcement. Yet,scarcely had this act been promulgated, when intelligencehaving arrived of the condemnation and deathof Anne Boleyn, and of the marriage of the kingwith the Lady Jane Seymour, the same legislators,with a tractability perfectly in unison with the wishesGEORGE BROWNE. 201of the sovereign and the sympathy of the Englishparliament, instantly repealed the above statute, and,by another, pronounced sentence of attainder on thelate Queen, George Boleyn, Lord Rochford, HenryNorris, Esq., Sir Francis Weston, William Breton,and Mark Smeaton, who had been accused as accomplicesin her alleged crimes. Both the former marriageswere by this act declared null and void ; thesuccession confirmed anew to the heirs of the king byQueen Jane ; and, in default of such heirs, Henry wasempowered to dispose of the inheritance of the crownof England and lordship of Ireland by letters patentor by will. With respect to the project of reformation,the king was declared supreme head on earth of theChurch of Ireland, with power to visit, repress, redress,reform, &c., all errors, heresies and abuses, &c., and toappoint a deputy for visiting, repressing, &c., same.All appeals to Rome in spiritual causes were abolished; the English law against slandering the kingin consequence of these innovations, was enacted andconfirmed in Ireland, the benefit of sanctuary takenaway in such cases, the provisions made in Englandfor the payment of first fruits to the king wereadopted, and his highness was invested, not onlywith the first fruits of bishoprics and other secularpromotions in the Church of Ireland, but withthose of abbeys, priories, colleges, and hospitals. Byanother act the authority of " the Bishop of Rome"was more solemnly renounced, and the maintainers ofit in Ireland made subject to praemunire ; all officerspf every kind and degree were directed to take the202 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.oath of supremacy, and every person, who should refuseit, declared as in England guilty of high treason ;all canons, constitutions, and dispensations, previouslymade, which were not repugnant to the laws of theprerogative, were, however, directed to be still used,but in the name of the king only, until order to thecontrary ; the twentieth part of the profits of all spiritualpromotions were to be paid yearly to Henry,his heirs and successors for ever, and the chancellorwas directed to inquire into the value thereof. Allpayment of pensions, and suing for dispensations,faculties, rescripts, &c., was utterly prohibited byadopting the English law made for this purpose, andaccommodating it to Ireland. Thirteen religious establishmentswere suppressed, and the demesnes andpossessions thereof vested in the crown, as were thoseof absentee proprietors by an arbitrary extension ofancient enactments. A statute of the same sessionenjoined, that spiritual promotions should be givenonly to such as could speak English, unless after fourproclamations in the next market-town such couldnot be had ; and that an oath should be administeredto every person on admission to any dignity, benefice,&c., to keep " within the place, territory, or parish,where he shall have pre-eminence, rule, benefice,or promotion, a school for to learn English, ifany children of his parish come to him to learn the same,taking for the keeping of the same school such convenientstipend or salary, as in the said land is accus-totallyused to be taken," and the administeringand observing said oath was enforced by penalties.GEORGE BROWNE. 203Lastly, an act was passed prohibiting ecclesiasticalproctors from being members of parliament, previousto which it appears, that two were returned to representeach diocese.When the above act of supremacy was broughtbefore this parliament, Archbishop Browne supportedit most devotedly. " Behold," he said, " your obedienceto your king is the observing of your God andSaviour Christ, for he, that High Priest of our souls,paid tribute to Caesar though no Christian, greaterhonour then surely is due to your prince s highnessthe king, and a Christian one. Rome and her bishops,in the Fathers days, acknowledged emperors,kings, and princes to be supreme over their dominions,nay, Christ s own vicars ; and it is much to theshame of the Bishop of Rome, to deny what the precedingbishops of that see owned." Adding, that hewould himself, without scruple, guile of innocence, orsin to God, vote the king supreme over ecclesiastical,as well as temporal matters, and head thereof, even ofboth isles, England and Ireland, while he concludedwith the characteristic argument, that he, who refusedhis assent to pass the act, could be no true subject ofthe king.* His address was seconded by JusticeBrabazon, and the statute, although not without somedifficulty, passed ; but Primate Cramer, remainingsteadfast to the Roman, Catholic faith, opposed itsexecution, and raised such obstacles thereto, that, notwithstandingthis parliamentary renunciation of theHarleian Miscellany, vol. v.204 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.Pope s, and acknowledgment of Henry s supremacyin matters of religion ; and, although all public oppositionwas silenced in every place where the Englishpower prevailed, yet, while this portion of theisland was but very limited, the adherents to the RomanCatholic faith throughout the rest of Ireland becamemore zealous and more devoted.This determined recusancy and opposition to thewishes of the intolerant monarch, did not sufficientlyjustify in his eyes the conduct of the prelate whomhe had exalted, and to whom he accordingly wrotethe following expostulation, in July, 1537- " RightReverend father in God, truly and well beloved !We greet you well, signifying unto you, that whereas,before your promotion and advancement to thatorder;, dignity, and authority of an archbishop, yeshewed an appearance of such entire zeal and affection,as well to the setting forth and preaching thesincere word of God, and avoiding of all superstitionused against the honour of the same, as to employyourself always diligently for your part, to procurethe good furtherance of any our affairs as muchas in you lay, and might appear to be our contentmentand satisfaction, that thinking your mind to beso earnestly fixed upon the same, that ye would persevereand continue still in that your good purpose ;yet, nevertheless, as we do both partly perceive,and partly by sundry ways and advertisements beinformed, the good opinion that we had conceived ofyou is in manner utterly frustrate. For neither doye give yourself to the instruction of our peopleGEORGE BROWNE. 2Q5there in the word of God, nor frame yourself tostand us in any stead for the furtherance of ouraffairs, such is the lightness of your behaviour, andsuch is the elation of your mind in pride, that gloryingin foolish ceremonies, and delighting in f weand fi us, in your dream comparing yourself so nearto a prince in honour and estimation, that all virtueand honesty is almost banished from you. Reformyourself therefore with this gentle advertisement,and do first your duty towards God, in the dueexecution of your office, do then your duty towardsus in the advancement of our affairs there, and in thesignification hither from time to time of the state ofthe same, and we shall put your former negligencein oblivion. If this will not serve to induce you toit,but, that ye will still so persevere in your fondfolly and ingrate gentleness, that ye cannot rememberwhat we have done, and how much abovemany others ye be bound in all the points beforetouched to do your duty, let it sink into your remembrance,that we be as able for the not doing thereofto remove you again, and to put another man ofmore virtue and honesty in your place, both for ourdischarge against God, and for the comfort of ourgood subjects there, as we were at the beginning toprefer you, upon hope that you would in the samedo your office, as to your profession and our opinionconceived of you appertained"*Seriously alarmed by such a letter from a so-statePapers, temp.

" May it please your mostexcellent highness to be advertised, that on the lathday of September I received your most graciousletters, bearing date at your majesty s manor ofSunning-hill, the last day of July, which perused, didnot only cause me to take fruitful and gracious monitions,but also made me to tremble in body for fearof incurring your majesty s displeasure. And whereyour majesty write unto me, I have not endeavouredmyself in setting forth and preaching the sincereword of God, avoiding all superstition used againstthe honour of the same, I may signify unto yourhighness of a verity, that for my small abode here,there hath not these many years any my predecessorsso much exercised in declaring to the people theonly gospel of Christ, persuading and inducing thehearers unto the true meaning of the same, utterlydespising the usurped power of the Bishop of Rome,being a thing not a little rooted among the inhabitantshere. Touching the second article in yourgrace s letters, concerning your majesty s affairs here,I refer me to judgment for the most part of yourhighness s council here, how in that behalf I haveused myself, being the first spiritual man that movedthe twentieth parts and first fruits, setting forth, inwhat me lay, the like first fruits of all monasteriesbeing before not motioned. But given is it to thisland, miserable of what behaviour or gesture so evermen be, to have mariners ; yea, those that be of suchGEORGE BROWNE. 9Q7subtle nature, that of others good proceedings themselvescan find means to win the praises, which, iftheir doings were apparent, God knoweth rightunworthy, that I beseech God, send once amongstus more charity. Concerning the third and lastarticle of your grace s letters, that I should use writingwe and us, I trust it hath not been seenin me, unless it were at such time, as I with my twochapters of Christ Church and St. Patrick s, directedour humble letters unto your highness, subscribedwith all our names, concerning the accomplishmentof your grace s letters to the said chapters and me,addressed for electing the dean of St. Patrick s,which, if I did, most humbly beseech your highness totake it in good part, for assuredly, it was by remissnessof the writer, and great oblivion of my foreseeingthe same, submitting my negligence untoyour grace upon my demeanour hereafter. Finally,certifying your majesty, that I received your grace sother letters, at this season to me addressed, on behalfof Edward Vaughan, the queen s gracious servant,the contents whereof I have fully accomplished.Beseeching your highness of your most accustomedgoodness, to accept this my rude letter, answerableeven as I were personally doing my duty, approachingon knees before your majesty, declaring thecertainty of all the premises, with acknowledging myignorances, desiring of God, that hour or minute Ishould prefix myself to declare the gospel of Christ,after any other sort than of my part most unworthyhave heretofore done before your majesty, in rebusARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.king the papistical power, or in any other point concerningthe advancement of your grace s affairsshould not be prompt to set forth benignly, that theground should open and swallow me. Certain sacra-centuriesthere be here, which, indeed, I have spokenagainst, perceiving well, that I have been the moremaligned at, beseeching the blessed Trinity to givethem better grace, and that your grace may see redress,as, when it shall be your determinate pleasure,your majesty may. So knoweth God, who preserveyour excellent highness in your regality long to per-Justly fearful of the tyrant he had bound himselfto obey, and conscious how ineffective were all hisexertions to introduce the tenets of the Reformationinto the hearts of those, over whom he was appointedto preside, Archbishop Browne, on the succeeding8th of January, writes as follows to Lord Crumwell :Right honourable and my singular good lord, mybounden duty premised, it may please your lordshipto be advertised, that within the parts of Ireland,which grieved me very sore yea, and that withinthe diocese of Dublin, and province of the same,where the king s power ought to be best known,where it hath pleased his most excellent highness,through your good lordship s preferment, to makeme, under his grace, a spiritual officer and chief overthe clergy; yet, that notwithstanding, neither bygentle exhortation, evangelical instruction, neither bySlate Papers, temp. Henry VIII.GEORGE BROWNE. 209oaths of them solemnly taken, nor yet by threats ofsharp correction, can I persuade or induce any, eitherreligious or secular, since my coming over, once topreach the word of God or the just title of our mostillustrious prince. And yet, before that our mostdread sovereign was declared to be (as he ever wasin deed) supreme head over the Church committedunto his princely cure, they, that then could andwould very often, even till the right Christians wereweary of them, preach after the old sort and fashion,will not now once open their lips in any pulpit forthe manifestation of the same ; but in corners andsuch company as them lieth, hindered and pluckedback amongst the people the labour that I do take inthat behalf; and yet they be borne against me, andespecially the observants, which be worst of all others ;for I can neither make them swear, nor yet preachamongst us, so little regard they mine authority. Andthat cometh, so far as I can judge, of the extremehandling that my lord deputy hath used towards me,what by often imprisonment, and also expelling memy own house, keeping there no hospitality at all ;and so contemptuously he vilipendeth me, that I takeGod to record I had, but that hope comfortedme, rather forsake all than to abide so many ignominiousreproaches. But, if your lordship would, forthe good love and mind that you bear unto the mereand sincere doctrine of God s word, and also untothe advancement and setting forward of our mostexcellent prince s right title, send either unto mastertreasurer, the chief justice, the master of the rolls, or210 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.any two of them whom I think meet for that purpose,such a straight commandment over me and allother ecclesiastical persons, as I perceive the king sgrace hath sent of late into England to the sheriffs ofevery shire, I would (God willing) so execute mineown office, and prick others forward that be underneathme, by the authority thereof, that his graceand your lordship should well allow my faithful heartand diligent service ; for, until such a thing or morevehement come amongst us, it is but vain to look afterany amendment here, but always expectation of the formerabuses. And to prove the same, there is never anarchbishop, nor bishop but myself made by the king,but he is repelled even now by provision. Again,for all that ever I could do, might I not make themonce, but as I send my own servants to do it, to cancelout of the canon of the mass, or other books, thename of the Bishop of Rome, whereby your lordshipmay perceive, that my authority is little regarded. Ihave advertised your lordship divers times what inconveniencemight fall for lack of dispensations ; for,in that point they be compelled to sue to Rome.Wherefore, I think good that with all celerity andspeed it were necessary that we had dispensations, avicar general, and a master of the faculties. There isof late come into Ireland from Rome a pardon, muchconsonant to a pardon granted by Julius the Second,in time of the wars between the French king andhim ; and that was, that they, that would enjoy it,should fast Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday, nextafter they heard first of it, and on the Sunday conesBROWNE. 211quietly ensuing to receive the communion. Andmany, as it is reported, hath received the same ; butif so traitorous a fact and like flagitious iniquitiesshould pass, neither justly examined nor condignlypunished, being committed while the king s grace scommissioners be here, seeing these men so readyand prompt to admit the Bishop of Rome s letter, andso sturdy and flinty against our prince s power, whatwill men think? I cannot, in my conscience, consideringmy oath and allegiance, let such enormitiesescape, but make just relation, that the king s majestymay have sure knowledge how unfaithful a sorthe hath in this land, and namely, the spiritualty,which seduced the rest. The living God knowethmy heart, who ever prosper your lordship with immortalfelicity. Amen"*While this letter eloquently evinces what littleprogress the Reformation had made under DoctorBrowne s auspices, and that the inferior clergy hadneither imbibed his spirit nor acceded to his measures,it does yet more plainly appear that he ,up to this period, aimed at little more thanthe acknowledgment of the king s supremacy as theparamount measure of ecclesiastical improvement.I he truth of this conclusion maybe testified by hiscorrespondence as detailed in this memoir, and vet.ore by the following instructions for praying in thisdiocese, or as they were styled "the form of the beads "issued and designed by this prelate for all the inculcatePapers, temp.

Wherefore and to the intent thatye should the better believe me herein, and take andreceive the truth as ye ought to do, I declare this untoyou not only of myself, which I know to be true, butalso declare unto you that the same is certified untome from the might of my ordinary, the Archbishopof Dublin, under his seal, which I have here ready toshow you, so that now it appeareth plainly, that thesaid Bishop of Rome hath neither authority norpower in this land, nor never had by God s laws ;therefore I exhort you all, that you deface him in allyour primers and other books where he is namedPope, and that you shall have from henceforth noconfidence nor trust in him nor in his bulls or lettersof pardon, which before time with his juggling castsof binding and loosing he sold unto you for your money,promising you therefore forgiveness of your sins,where of truth no man can forgive sins but God only;and also that ye fear not his great thunder claps ofexcommunication or interdiction, for they cannothurt you, but let us put all our confidence and trustin our Saviour Jesus Christ, which is gentle and loving,and requireth nothing of us when we haveoffended him, but that we should repent and forsakeour sins, and believe steadfastly that he is Christ, theSon of the living God, and that he died for our sins,and forth, as it is contained in the Credo ; and thatthrough him and by him, and by none other, we shallhave remission of our sins, c a poena et culpiV according214 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.to his promises made to us in many and divers placesof Scripture.

On the second part ye shallpray for all earls, barons, lords, and in especial forthe estate of the right honourable Lord Leonard Gray,Lord Deputy of this land of Ireland, and for all themthat be of the king s most honourable council, thatGod may put them in mind to give such counsel, thatit may be to the pleasure of Almighty God andwealth of this land.

In the same despatch he entreatedthe king to write " semblaby to the chapter, exhortingthem upon such resignation made to elect such aperson as their archbishop should name unto them,without expressing or making mention of the said SirEdward in the same letter, least the chapter, being inmanner all native of this land, and beforehand admonishedthat the intent was to have an Englishmanpreferred thereunto, would so consult together as thesame should take no effect"* The opportune deathof Dean Fyche in less than two months made the consummationof this disgraceful intrigue unnecessary, andBasnet was thereupon appointed his successor. ThatCrumwell s good service, however, was neither gratuitous,nor to be unrequited by this termination of theaffair, is evinced by a letter of the vice-treasurerBrabazon to him, dated on the 24th of April following,in which, alluding to the remittance of money toIreland, he desires his lordship " to detain 40 sterlingfor his lordship s good will in the preferment ofhis bateman, Sir Edward Basnet, to the room of thedean of St. Patrick s here." Yet withal so unworthywas Basnet to be the object of this selection, thatwhen King Henry resolved on the dissolution of St.Patrick s cathedral, he was the dean who, unlawfullyState Papers, temp. Hen. VIII.216 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.and by actual force and imprisonment of the membersof the chapter, effected the surrender of all its revenues,estates, and possessions to the crown, circumstancesthat so inflamed the honest indignation of hissuccessor, Dean Swift, that, writing on the back ofone of the deeds connected with the transaction, hestiles him " the scoundrel who surrendered thedeanery to that beast, Henry the Eighth."Early in the year 1538 he again communicated toLord Crumwell his vexation of spirit at the ill successof the Irish Reformation. " Right honourable and mysingular good lord, I acknowledge my bounden dutyto your lordship s good will to me next to my SaviourChrist s for the place I now possess. I pray Godgive me his grace to execute the same to his gloryand his highnesses honour, with your lordship s instructions.The people of this nation are zealous yetblind and unknowing; most of the clergy, as yourlordship hath had from me before, being ignorantand not able to speak right words in the mass orliturgy, as being not skilled in the Latin grammar, sothat a bird may be taught to speak with as muchsense as several of them do in this country. Thesesorts, though not scholars, yet are crafty to cozen thepoor people, and to dissuade them from following hishighness s orders ; George, my brother of Armagh,doth underhand occasion quarrels, and is not activeto execute his highness s orders in his diocese. Ihave observed your lordship s letter of commission,Mason s St. Patrick s, p. 150.-GEORGE BROWNE. 217and do find several of my pupils leave me for so doing; I will not put others in their livings till I doknow your lordship s pleasure, for it is meet I acquaintyou first, that the Romish relics and images ofboth my cathedrals in Dublin took off the commonpeople from the true worship, but the prior and thedean find them so sweet for their gain that they heednot my words. Therefore send, in your lordship snext to me, an order more full and a chide to themand their canons that they might be removed. Letthe order be that the chief governors may assist me init. The prior and dean have written to Rome to beencouraged, and if it be not hindered before theyhave a mandate from the Bishop of Rome, the peoplewill be bold, and then tug long before his highnesscan submit them to his grace s orders. The countryfolk here much hate your lordship, and despitefullycall your lordship in their Irish tongue 6 the blacksmiths son The Duke of Norfolk is by Armaghand that clergy desired to assist them not to suffer hishighness to alter church rules here in Ireland. As afriend I desire your lordship to look to your nobleperson, for Rome hath a great kindness for that duke,(for it is so talked here,) and will reward him and hischildren; Rome hath great favours for this nation,purposely to oppose his highness, and so have theygot, since the act passed, great indulgences for rebellion; therefore my hope is lost, yet my zeal is to doaccording to your lordship s orders. God keep yourlordship from your enemies here and in England.218 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.Your lordship s at commandment, &c."* About thesame time he wrote to the lord chancellor Allen theletter concerning the stations kept at St. John s well,as detailed in the History of the County of Dublin,p. 635 ; and another letter of his to lord Crumwell,relative to the suppression of the monasteries, andseeking a grant of that of Grace Dieu, with all itspossessions, for himself, has been alluded to at thatlocality in the said work ; while, in order better totestify his claims on royal favour, he about this timecaused the before-mentioned images to be removedfrom Christ Church, and the celebrated relic calledSt. Patrick s staff, which had been carried off fromthe cathedral of Armagh in the twelfth century, andwas from that time reverentially preserved in theformer church, was by his direction publicly burnedin High-street, Dublin.Soon after the intelligence reached the Castle,that the Pope had sent over a bull of excommunicationagainst all those who had theretofore or should thereaftermaintain the king s supremacy, whereupon ArchbishopBrowne again wrote t( To the lord privy sealwith speed.

" GEORGE Browne"*On the following 24th of June, (1538), in thezealous exercise of his mission, this prelate seized aHarleian Miscellany, vol. v.GEORGE BROWNE. 221Franciscan friar, named O Brien, about whose personwas found a letter, purporting to be from the Bishop ofMeath to O Neill, and couched in the followingowords: "My son, O Neill, thou and thy fathers wereall along faithful to the mother Church of Rome. Hisholiness Paul, now Pope, and the council of the Cardinalsthere, have lately found out a prophecy thereremaining of one St. Laserianus, an Irish Bishop ofCash el, wherein he saith, that the mother Church ofRome falleth, when in Ireland the Catholic faith isovercome ; therefore, for the glory of the motherChurch, the honour of St. Peter, and your own secureness,suppress heresy and his holiness s enemies ;for, when the Roman faith there perished, the seeof Rome falleth also ; therefore, the council of Cardinalshave thought fit to encourage your countryof Ireland, as a sacred island, being certified, whilstthe mother Church hath a son of worth, as yourself,and of those that shall succour you, and join therein,that she will never fall, but have more or less aholding in Britain, in spite of fate. Thus, havingobeyed the order of the most sacred council, we recommendyour princely person to the Holy Trinity,the Blessed Virgin, St. Peter, St. Paul, and all theheavenly host of heaven. Amen"* On furtherexamination and searches made, but which elicitedno other evidence of guilt, this friar was pilloriedand sentenced to imprisonment, until his highness sfull order should be received for his trial ; but, be-harleighMiscellany, vol. v.222 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.fore any such intimation arrived, he was found deadin his prison, having, as it was industriously alleged,been accessary to his own decease ; the corse, however,was carried to the Gallows-green, there suspended,and afterwards buried.Leland asserts, that O Neill, immediately uponthis commission, placed himself at the head of thenorthern Irish, " declared war against the invaders ofthe Papal rights, led his forces through the territoriesof Meath, denouncing the terrors of his princelyvengeance against all the enemies of religion, andcommitting various excesses without control or resistance,and, advancing to Tara, reviewed his troops,with an ostentatious display of their numbers andprowess." " But these champions of the Church," headds, " exhausted all their zeal in this vain-gloriousdefiance of English government. Instead of proceedingin any well concerted scheme of hostilities,they seemed contented with the havoc they hadmade, and the prey they had collected, and marchedback in triumph towards their own settlements"*Whatever obscurity is thrown over the designs andactions of O Neill, the reaction of hostility was certainlymore clearly evinced. The Lord Deputy harassedthe retreat of the fugitives, gave them battleat the pass of Bellahoe, and slew four hundred oftheir number. Nor did this suffice, as appears froma despatch of Lord Grey soon afterwards, whereinhe says, If my guides had guided right, I hadLeland s Ireland, vol. ii. p. 179.GEORGE BROWNE. 223taken or slain O Neill; howbeit the guides missedthe way, so that the day broke up when I was withinfive miles of the said Dungannon, and then I fellto preying and burning of his country, and so continuedsix days after, burning and destroying, duringwhich time I and my company lacked no flesh, butbread, and drink except water, was scarce"* In vaindid the unfortunate O Neill appeal to his king, accusingthe deputy of waging this war for his privategain, and offering to restrain all the Northern Irish,if his Majesty would but relieve him and them fromthe extortions of his viceroy ;f but this is matterbeyond the track of these memoirs, and must beavoided.Returning therefore to the archbishop. At theclose of the year 1 538, " on New Year s Day, atKilkenny, he preached the word of God, having verygood audience, publishing the king s injunctions andthe king s translation of the Pater Noster and AveMaria, the Articles of the Faith and Ten Commandmentsin English, divers papers whereof the councildelivered to the bishop and other prelates of thediocese, commanding them to do the like through alltheir jurisdictions"!

For expiring whereof, we thinkit meet, under your highnesses pardon, that by authorityof parliament it should be ordained, thatyour majesty, your heirs and successors, should benamed kings of this land, which, nevertheless, weremit to your most excellent wisdom." At theclose of the same year, when the Lord Deputy St.Leger journeyed to meet the Earl of Desmond atCashel, this prelate was sent as one of the pledgesand hostages which that nobleman required, as theguarantee of his safety, before he would place himselfwithin the English linesState Papers, temp.

" According mymost humble and obedient duty, it may please yourmost excellent majesty to be advertised, that themorrow after Trinity Sunday your highness s parliamentbegun in this your highness s realm, and forthat, the Earls of Ormondee and Desmond, andmany other lords of Munster were not then come,we deferred the solemn mass of the Holy Ghost tillthe Thursday following, being Corpus Christ dayThe said earls, with divers other Lords of Munster,as the Lord Barry, the Lord Roche, the Lord FitsMaurice, the Lord Bermingham, and Magill Patrick,now made by your highness Baron of Upper Ossory,came the Tuesday, and were all present at the saidmass, the most part of them in their robes, and rodein procession in such sort, as the like thereof hathnot been seen here of many years. And the Fridayfollowing, being assembled in the place of parliamentaccustomed, the commons presented untous their speaker, one Sir Thomas Cusack, a man thatright painfully hath served your majesty at all times,who made a right solemn proposition in giving suchlaud and praise to your majesty, as justly and mostworthily your majesty hath merited, as well for the extirpationof the usurped power of the Bishop of Romeout of this your realm, who had of many years been agreat robber and destroyer of the same, as also for yourQ226 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.innumerable benefits showed unto your realms andsubjects of the same, which proposition was rightwell and prudently answered by your highness schancellor here ; and after, both the effect of theproposition and answer was briefly and prudentlydeclared in the Irish tongue to the said lords, by themouth of the Earl of Ormondee, greatly to their contention.And that done, and the said speaker andcommons withdrawn, it was by me your poor servantproposed, that forasmuch as your majesty had alwaysbeen the only protected and defender under God ofthis realm, that it was most meet, that your majestyand your heirs should from thenceforth be namedand called king of the same, and caused the bill devisedfor the same to be read, which once being readand declared to them in Irish, all the whole housemost willingly and joyously condescended and agreedto the same, and being three times read, and withone voice agreed, we sent the same to the lowerhouse, wherein likewise it passed with no less joyand willing consent. And upon the Saturday following,the same bill being read in plain parliamentbefore the lords and commons, it was by me yourmost humble servant most joyously consented, no lessto my comfort, than to be again risen from life todeath, that I so poor a wretch should by your excellentgoodness be put to that honour, that in mytime your majesty should most worthily have anotherimperial crown. I most humbly beseech AlmightyGod long to continue your majesty in the honour hehath hitherto maintained you in. There was at theGEORGE BROWNE. 227same consent two earls, three viscounts, sixteenbarons, two archbishops, twelve bishops, DonoghO Brien, and the Doctor O Nolan, and a bishop,deputies assigned by the great O Brien, to be forhim in the parliament, the great O Reilly, withmany other Irish captains, and the common house,wherein are divers knights, and many gentlemen offair possessions. And for that the thing passed sojoyously, and so much to the contention of everyperson, the Sunday following there were made inthe city great bonfires, wine set in the streets, greatfeasting in their houses, with a goodly sort of guns ;and for that all men should have the more cause torejoice, I with others of your majesty s councilthought it good, that all prisoners, not lying at suitof any party for debt or such like, should be freelydelivered out of the prisons wherein they were, unlessit were for treason, wilful murder, rape, or debt.And the said Sunday all your lords and gentlemenrode to your church of St. Patrick s, where was sunga solemn mass by the Archbishop of Dublin, andafter the mass the said act proclaimed there in thepresence of 2000 persons, and Te Deum sung withgreat gladness and joy to all men. And for becausemy riches is small, I have sent your majestya poor pair of gloves of silk, beseeching your majestyto accept the same, so simple a present, as of himthat would as gladly present you with the empire ofthe whole world, if it were in him to give. BeseechingAlmighty God to send your excellent majesty noless honours, than the most honourable that everQ2228 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.reigned in earth. From your grace s manor of Kil-markham,"&c.*In this parliament it was further enacted, thatall religious persons, as well men as women professedof what order, rule, or habit they weremight, after the then contemplated suppression ofthe abbeys, &c., to which they belonged, purchaselands, &c., as though they had never been professed,and sue and be sued as other subjects, and enjoy alllawful things in like manner ; provided, however, thatthey should not take or claim lands, &c., as heirs toany person, nor marry, unless on proof that theirvows of profession were taken by compulsion. Provisionwas also made for the erecting of vicaragesin parish churches, and endowing them with a properproportion of lands and tithes " for the maintenanceof divine service, and keeping good hospitality withintheir said parishes," reserving to the king yearlythe twentieth part and first fruits on every presentation,and the patronage. In the second session ofthe same parliament, the monasteries and other religioushouses were formally suppressed, and theabbots and priors, who had been induced to makewhat were absurdly termed voluntary surrenders oftheir houses and possessions, of whom twenty-fourwere lords of parliament, were pensioned by theking. But in the remoter parts of the island, theorder for their dissolution was disregarded, and in agreat portion of the country they existed for half aState Papers, temp. Hen. VIII.GEORGE BKOWM-:. 229century longer. Sir John Davis bears testimony tothe fact, that "the abbeys and religious houses inTyrone, Donegal, and Fermanagh were never surveyednor reduced into charge, but were continuallypossessed by the religious persons* until the reign ofJames the First, and even the sees of Ulster werewholly filled by the Pope s provision until 1605. Inthe same year (1541) King Henry the Eighth changedthe priory of the Holy Trinity, on its suppressionas a monastic establishment, into a deanery and chapter,since which it has generally borne the name ofChrist Church. In this new constitution, as it appearsupon record, the cathedral was to consist of adean and chapter, a chanter, a treasurer, six vicarschoral, and two singing boys, allowing to them45 6s. Sd. English, during pleasure, which sumQueen Mary established for ever, when she confirmedthe deanery with alterations, and so it continueduntil the time of King James the First. Itis observable, that, on the change above alluded to,the last prior became the first dean.In 1542 an inquisition was taken of the possessionsof this see in the county and city of Dublin,at which time the king wrote to the Privy Council ofIreland, " shewing them the necessity of providinggood and faithful pastors through the diocese of Dublin,for instructing the people in the duties of religion,and no less in obedience to these new laws,which every day restored to them more and more oftheir Christian liberty, and promoted trade and in-230 AticiiBisHors OF Dublin.dusty through the whole kingdom"* In the followingyear, a contest, which had depended betweenthis prelate and Sir Christopher, Lord of Howth,concerning the right, title, and inheritance of Irelands Eye, was decided by the Lord Chancellor, infavour of the archbishop and his successors In 1544this prelate erected three prebends in Christ Church,St. Michael s, St. Michan s and St. John s, and assignedto each of the prebendaries a pension and achurch for the corps of their prebends. He also,about the same time, united the chapel of St. MaryLes Dames and the church of St. Andrew to St.Jedburgh s within the walls, " in regard there wereso few parishioners, and the income so small, thatthere was not sufficient to maintain a clergyman;"and in the following year he obtained a licence tounite the church of St. John s of Kilmainham andSt. James s church without the suburbs of Dublin, tothat of St. Catherine within the suburbs. By deedof the 12th of July, 1545, this prelate, in considerationof 40, conveyed to trustees the town ofRathlande, and sixty acres of arable land in the villageand fields of Rathlande, being on the southern part ofThomas Court wood, then lately occupied by ThomasBathe ; also, all the lands, &c., in Rathlande aforesaid,and the rents and reversions of the same, to holdfor ever, to the use of William Brabazon, ancestor ofthe Earl of Meath, his heirs and assigns, at theMason s St. Patrick s, p. 149. t Hot. in Cane. Hib.GEORGE BROWNE. 231yearly rent of 13s. 4d.,* being the site of thatwretched district of paupers, now denominated theEarl of Meath s Liberties. At the close of the year1546, on the dissolution of the cathedral of St. Patricks, another partial valuation was made of sundrydignities and benefices in this diocese.Edward the Sixth, immediately on his accessionsby the advice of his council, " altered the Liturgybook from what King Henry had formerly printedand established," causing the same to be printed inEnglish, commanding it to be read and sung in theseveral cathedrals and parish churches of England forthe common benefit of the nobility, gentry, and commonalty; and, that his subjects of Ireland might likewiseparticipate of the same sweetness, he sent overorders, (yet, not until the fourth year of his reign), tohis viceroy, Sir Anthony St. Leger, then being LordDeputy of that nation, that the same be forthwiththere in Ireland observed within their several bishoprics,cathedrals, and parish churches, which wasfirst observed in Christ Church, at Dublin, on thefeast of Easter, 1551, before the said Sir Anthony,George Browne, and the mayor and bailiffs of Dublin,John Lockwood being then dean of the said cathedral."! The amended Liturgy was thereuponpartially promulgated in this country, with rules annexedfor ecclesiastical habits and ceremonies. It isfurther worthy of remark, that this was the first bookprinted in Ireland, its printer, Humphrey Powell,Rot. Pat. 12th July, 3(3 Hen. VIII. t Harlcian Miscellany, vol. v.232 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.having come over from England in the same year inwhich it appeared, with the paramount object of itspublication. Before, however, any state manifestowas sent forth on the subject, an assembly was held inDublin, consisting of the prelates and clergy of Ireland,when Archbishop George Dowdal of Armagh,and his suffragans, vehemently opposed the innovation." Sir Anthony St. Leger then took up the order,and held it forth to Archbishop Browne, who, standingup, received it, saying, 6 This order, good brethren,is from our gracious king, and from the rest ofour brethren, the fathers and clergy of England, whohave consulted herein, and compared the Holy Scriptureswith what they have done, unto whom I submit,as Jesus did to Caesar, in all things just and lawful,making no questions why or wherefore, as we ownhim our true and lawful king. After this several ofthe meeker or most moderate of the bishops andclergy of Ireland cohered with George Browne ;"*who, in furtherance of the royal object, preached uponthis occasion a sermon against keeping the Scripturesin the Latin tongue, and against the worship ofimages. It is printed at the end of his life, and is theonly part of his writings extant, except the beforementioned letters. In this he particularly inveighedagainst the Jesuits.Saint Leger was soon afterwards succeeded bySir James Crofts, " who, on his coming over, endeavouredmuch for the persuading of George DowdalHarleian Miscellany, vol. v.GEORGE BROWNE. 233to adhere to the order aforesaid; but Dowdal being obdurate,his majesty and the learned privy council then ofEngland, for his perverseness, upon the 20th of Octoberfollowing, deprived him of the title of Primate of allIreland, and conferred the same on ArchbishopBrowne and his successors, by reason that he was thefirst of the Irish bishops, who embraced the order forestablishing of the English Liturgy and Reformationin Ireland." Leland and others more fully detail, thatwhen the deputy requested Dowdal to appoint a place,where "he might conveniently have an opportunityof appeasing wrath between the fathers of the churchand his grace," the primate complied, though he declinedappearing at the palace, and at the same time,expressed his apprehensions of the inutility of theproposed conference. < 1 fear, he said, < that it isin vain for me to converse with an obstinate numberof churchmen, and in vain for your lordship to supposethe difference between us can be so soon appeased,as our judgments, opinions, and consciencesare so different. But, Sir James, anxious to securethe co-operation of one, who held the highest stationin the Irish Church, appointed the conference to beheldat the temporary residence of Dowdal, whereStaples, Bishop of Meath, advocated the principles ofthe Reformation, while the primate maintained thoseof the Roman Catholic faith. Like all similar discussions,however, the conference terminated withouteffecting any change in the sentiments of eitherHarleian Miscellany, vol. v.234 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.party ; both, indeed, retired more firmly devoted totheir previous professions.In 1552 inquisitions were taken concerning thepossessions of this see within the city and county ofDublin. In the following year, on the accession ofQueen Mary, she obliged Browne to surrender hispatent of the primacy, and to deliver it cancelled intothe Chancery, where a vacant remains upon it on record; and upon the 12th of October, in the sameyear, she passed new letters patent under the greatseal, whereby she re-established the title and office ofthe primacy of all Ireland in the see of Armagh, forever,according to ancient usage. " We restore,"says she, " to Dowdal, Archbishop of Armagh, theprimacy of all Ireland, which your predecessors, beyondthe memory of man, have been known to haveheld, and we confirm to you for ever the same, commandingthat all other archbishops and bishops shallpay obedience to the primates in the exercise of theirprimatial office. * From which period the pre-emihence has remained firm and undisputed in Armagh,without any revocation either by Queen Elizabeth orany of her successors.Very soon afterwards, about the close of the year1554, Archbishop Browne was, by primate Dowdaland other delegates expelled and driven from his seeas being a married man ; " and it is thought," (addsthe historian of the transaction with much simplicity,)"had he not been married he had been expelled,Ware s Bishops, p. 78.HUGH CURWEtf. 235having appeared so much for the Reformation in boththese former kings days. On his expulsion, all thetemporalities belonging to the archbishopric werecommitted to Thomas Lockwood, then Dean of ChristChurch. The precise period at which Browne diedhas not been ascertained, but it has been most commonlyreferred to the year 1556. The see continuedvacant until, a licence having issued on the 22nd ofFebruary, 1555, from King Philip and Queen Maryto proceed to the election of a successor, HughCurwen was advanced to the dignity.HUGH CURWEN.[Succ. 1555. Resign. 1567.]Archbishop Curwen was a native of Westmoreland,and of a family who claimed descent fromGospatric Earl of Northumberland, but assumed thename of Curwen from a locality so denominated inthe district of Galloway. This original appellationwas first altered by Sir Christopher de Culwen, whowas twice sheriff of Cumberland by that title, andonce by the name of Curwen. His descendant/thesubject of the present memoir, was doctor of laws,Dean of Hereford in 1541, and by some said to havebeen also Archdeacon of Oxford ; but Wood, in theAthens Oxonienses," denies the latter of thesepromotions, and says it was a Richard Curwen whowas Archdeacon of Oxford, and not this Hugh.Queen Mary s letter, under her privy signet to thedean and chapter of Christ Church for his election,23G ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.dated the 1 8th of February, in the first and secondyear of her reign, is preserved in the chapter houseof that cathedral, and appears signed on the top inher own handwriting " Mary the Queene ;" yet wasit not until the 8th of September following that hewas consecrated according to the Roman pontifical inSt. Paul s Church, London, together with JamesTurberville, Bishop of Exeter, and William Glynn,bishop of Bangor, and four days after was at Greenwichappointed by Queen Mary (whose chaplain hewas) chancellor of Ireland. On the 25th of thesame month she wrote to the dean and chapter ofChrist Church to receive him honourably and withdue respect, announcing that he was repairing " toreside upon the cure of his bishopric, which now oflong time hath been destitute of a Catholic bishop,as also to occupy the office of our high chancellor ofthat our realm. 3 * Accordingly, on the 20th of Octoberfollowing he took possession of his see, on thenext day was restored to its temporalities, and on thethird took the oath of office before the lord deputyand council. Immediately after his elevation heresigned his deanery of Hereford, but in a monthresumed and retained it until the year 1558. Aletter yet extant thus alludes to his first sermon.The Archbishop of Dublin did preach his firstsermon that he made in this land in Christ Church,and did set forth the word of God sincerely in hissermon and after such a sort, that those men, who beHarleian Miscellany, vol. v.HUGH CURWEN. 287learned and unlearned, both do give him as highpraise as I have heard given to any one man, so thatthose men who favour the word of God are very gladof him and prayer for him so to continue." At theclose of this the first year of his advancement he helda provincial synod, in which many constitutions weremade respecting the ceremonies of divine worship.In 1556 the Earl of Sussex, on the occasion ofhis being appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland, proceededto St. Patrick s cathedral, " nobly accompanied,and was received at the church door byArchbishop Curwen under a canopy of state, thatprelate being arrayed in his pontificals, and the clergyin rich copes ; there kneeling he was censed, and,having kissed the cross, received the blessing of thearchbishop, after which he proceeded towards the highaltar where he continued kneeling, while the hymnTe Deum was singing. He was there censed asecond time and blessed, and service was performedby the archbishop, after which the deputy arose fromhis place, proceeded to the altar, and, having kneeledthere for a certain space of time, offered a piece ofgold, after which ceremony he dined with the archbishop"* In the same year, commissioners were appointedto take account of all lands or tenements, allplate, bells, and other utensils, or sums of money,which lately had belonged to the churches or chapelsof this diocese ; and to inquire into the state ofsuch churches and chapels as were ruinous, and toMason s St. Patrick s, p. 163.238 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.report by whose fault they became so. Similar commissionswere issued for the other dioceses of Ireland.*At this time likewise, the act was passed(3 & 4 Hill. & Mary, c. 8), repealing all statutes andprovisions made against the See Apostolic of Rome,from the time of the twentieth year of Henry VIII.,so far as the acts of such see should not be prejudicialto authority royal, or the laws in force. Other statutesof the same session revived all former acts passedfor the punishment of heresies, renounced the enjoymentby the crown of first fruits, rectories, glebes, &c.,and assigned such, as had come to the queen, for theaugmentation of poor benefices.On the accession of Queen Elizabeth, Curwenaccommodated his conduct and conscience to the policyof his new sovereign, and her liberal favour washis recompence. In November, 1557, he was constitutedone of the Lords Justices of Ireland in conjunctionwith Sir Henry Sydney, and, in the followingyear, as Chancellor, received from the hands ofthat nobleman a new great seal of Ireland, while similarnew seals were on the same occasion given tothe principal judges of the other courts In June,1559, he was appointed Keeper of the Great Seal ofIreland, took the oath of office on the 8th of Augustfollowing, and, in the same year, was joined in a commissionfor mustering the inhabitants of the county ofDublin. He was one of the spiritual lords, who sat in theparliament of 1560, at which the Act of Uniformitywas passed, as particularly mentioned in "The HistoryRolls in Chancery. f Borlase s Reduction of Ireland, p. 121.HUGH CUHWEN. 23f)of the County of Dublin," at the locality of Cardiff. Inthat parliament were also passed the act restoring to thecrown the " ancient jurisdiction" over the state ecclesiasticaland spiritual, and abolishing all foreign powerrepugnant to the same ; the " act for the conferringand consecrating of archbishops and bishops within thisrealm," whereby, forasmuch as their election by deansand chapters was declared to cause long delay andgreat charges to such prelates, and to be derogatoryto the queen s prerogative, it was enacted, thatthenceforth the queen, her heirs and successors, orthe Lord Deputy, might by letters patent collate fitpersons to the same, whereupon the said personsmight be consecrated, as if all former ceremonies andelections had been done ; and have, thereupon, allpossessions, profits, jurisdictions, dignities, c., asformer bishops.In 1562 the Queen sent an order requiring allpersons to assist the proctors of St. Patrick s cathedralin collecting honey, fruit, and other things,which had been paid from the earliest period of timefrom all parts of the province to the dean and chapterof that church ; these, being either duties reservedin their leases, or benefactions of the pious in ancienttimes, were to be applied to the repair of the church,which during the suppression had fallen much intodecay. The proctors were, however, strictly prohibitedfrom carrying about with them any pastoralstaff, crucifix, mass-book,* &c. In 1563 ArchbishopRot. in Cane. Hib.240 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.Curve was again constituted Lord Chancellor, andan original letter of his, bearing date in June of thefollowing year, to the Earl of Sussex, deprecating theerection of St. Patrick s, Dublin, into a university,is extant amongst the Cottonian manuscripts. In1567> beginning to sink under the infirmities of oldage, he procured his translation to Oxford, and havingspent one year in that see, died at Swinbroch,near Bedford, in the parish church of which he wasburied on the first of November, 1568. Yet it isobservable that, neither in the grant of the royalassent for this prelate s removal to Oxford, nor of hisrestitution to its temporalities, is any notice taken ofhis having previously been Archbishop of Dublin.ADAM Lotus.[Succ. 1567. Ob. 1605.]Adam Loftus was born at Swineherd, in Yorkshire,the youngest son of an ancient and wealthyfamily, who contributed a more than ordinary allowancefor his support and education at the universityof Cambridge. During his course there, he, on theoccasion of a public exhibition, so well performed hispart as a florid orator and subtle disputant, and withalpresented such a comely person and courtly address,as to attract the notice of Queen Elizabeth, who encouragedhim to proceed in his studies, with a graciouspromise of early promotion, which she soonafterwards verified by sending him into Ireland aschaplain to the Earl of Sussex, on his appointment toADAM Lotus. 241the government of that country. So early and effectivelywas the royal eye attracted by the courtierclerk, that on the Sth of October, 1561, he obtainedletters patent for the rectory of Painstown, in thediocese of Meath; and having been, in 1562, at thevery early age of 28, appointed to succeed ArchbishopDowdal in the see of Armagh, he was consecratedby Hugh Archbishop of Dublin about theclose of that year. In consequence of which, asHarris remarks, the Irish Protestant bishops derivetheir succession through him, without any pretence ofblemish or open for cavil, for he was consecrated byCurwen, who had been consecrated in England accordingto the forms of the Roman pontifical, in thethird year of Queen Mary"*In 1564 he was elected Dean of St. Patrick s,the Queen giving her licence for his holding thatdignity with the primacy, his archbishopric beinga place of great charge, in name and title only to beesteemed, without any worldly endowment resultingfrom it."f In 1566, when O Weill destroyed thecity and cathedral of Armagh by force, PrimateLoftus directed against him the spiritual weaponof excommunication, pronounced not only by himself,but by all the clergy of his diocese," the Irish chieftain,however, utterly disregarded his ecclesiasticaldenunciations. J At the close of that year Loftus tookhis degree of doctor of divinity at Cambridge, andWare s Bishops, p. 94. f Rot. in Cane. Hib.| Ware s Annals of Elizabeth, c. 9.242 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.on the 8th of August, 1567, was appointed to thissee, which being then deemed more valuable he accepted,and also, in obedience to the queen s letterof the 10th of June preceding, resigned the deaneryof St. Patrick s, to the end that Doctor Weston, thenewly appointed Chancellor of the realm, might beendowed with that dignity.In 1568 this prelate, supported by the Bishops ofMeath and Kildare, consecrated Doctor Lancaster (whohad been treasurer of Salisbury and chaplain to thequeen) as his own successor in Armagh ; the ceremonywas performed in Christ Church cathedral. In 1570was passed the act directing that a free school shouldbe kept in every diocese, in the principal shire townof the see, at the cost of the whole diocese ; the ordinaryof each to pay one third of the master s salary,and the parsons, vicars, prebendaries, and otherecclesiastical persons of the see the other two parts,by contributions to be settled by the ordinary ; norwere church livings in the possession of the crownexempted from this assessment, but on the contrary,lest any construction of the royal prerogative shouldlessen the fund for this national object, such livingswere expressly charged thereto in the hands of thequeen or her patentees. In May, 1572, her majesty,on a representation of the poverty of the see of Dublin,was induced to grant to Doctor Loftus a dispensationto hold with his archbishopric any comfortablesinecures not exceeding 100 per annum in value,a licence of which this prelate very fully availed himself.In the following year he also obtained thechancellorship, with all its patronage and emolu-ADAM Lotus. 243ments, which office he enjoyed (with the intermissionof a few months) to the time of his decease.Harris indeed, in his notice of this prelate, affords atthe following year of his life the most striking noteof " the excessive ambition and avarice" by which, asheadmits, his better qualities were tarnished. " Forbesides his promotions in the Church and his publicemployments in the State, he grasped at every thingthat became void, either for himself or family, insomuchthat the dean and chapter of Christ Churchwere so wearied with his importunities, that on the28th of August, 1578, upon granting him some request,they obliged him to promise not to petition orbecome suitor to them for any advowson of any prebendor living, nor for any lease of any benefice, norfor any fee farm. But, when an entry of this promisecame to be made in the chapter books in his presence,he would have thrust in an exception of onepetition more and no more, which the dean andchapter would not consent to, being, as they allegedm that entry, contrary to his lordship s promise madem the chapter house. However this disposition of hiswas afterwards of service, in preserving the ancientcathedral of St. Patrick s from being dissolved andconverted into a university. For being greatly interestedin the livings of that church, by long leasesand other estates thereof granted either to himself,his children or kinsmen, he opposed Sir John Parrot,Lord Deputy, in his attempt of converting the revenuesthereof to the uses aforesaid," a circumstancewhich ultimately led to Perrot s unhappy fate.R 2244 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.In 1582 Loftus was one of the Lords Justices ofIreland, and again in 1585. In 1583 he was theunjust judge that illegally sentenced the Roman CatholicArchbishop of Cashel, Dermot Hurley, to thecruelties of death on Osmantown-green. See fully onthis event, " The History of the County of Dublin,"p. 518. "In 1585 Sir John Perrot made a journeyto the north, and left Archbishop Loftus and SirHenry Wallop Lords Justices during his absence,His back was no sooner turned, but they wrote lettersof complaint against him to Sir Francis Walsingham,Secretary of State, which, with the insinuationsof Sir Jeffrey Fenton, then in England, to thequeen, proved the first dawning of Perrot s troubles.The same year great unkindness burst out betweenthe Lord Deputy Perrot and Archbishop Loftus,partly upon public accounts, and chiefly concerningSt. Patrick s Church, which the lord deputy had inhis instructions to convert to a college, and had a greatdesire to set it forward, but Archbishop Loftus opposedhim, being interested in the livings of St.Patrick s by long leases, and other estates thereof,granted either to himself, his children or kinsmen,and, therefore, did by all means withstand the alienationof these revenues, and, being a man of a highspirit and used to bear sway in the government, hegrew into contradiction, and from contradiction tocontention with the deputy, who, on the other sidebrooking no opposition, it grew to some heat betweenthem ; whereof the queen taking notice wrote tothem both to reconcile themselves together. But theADAM Lotus. 245archbishop stuck to him to the last, and was a maininstrument in bringing him to his condemnation ;and Perrot in his last will solemnly testified that thearchbishop falsely belied him in his declaration againsthim." 4 The ill-fated ex-deputy was found guilty ofthe charges urged against him, and only escaped frompublic execution by a more sudden visitation of deathin his prison at the tower. In 1589 Doctor Loftusdrew still more upon the munificence of his sovereign,and acquired a grant of " the office of the prerogative"to him, and Doctor Ambrose Forth, and thesurvivor of themesAlthough he, as before mentioned, successfully resistedthe conversion of his church into a university,yet was he a zealous promoter of that which nowexists in the city of Dublin, by employing his interestand good offices in its behalf with Queen Elizabeth,and with many men of power in England ; he also, bytwo elaborate speeches, delivered in the hearing of themayor, aldermen, and commons of Dublin, prevailedupon that body to endow the infant establishment."An act, 5 said the prelate, " of good acceptance withGcd, of great reward hereafter, and of honourand advantage to yourselves, and more to yourlearned offspring in the future ; where by the helpof learning they may build your families somestories higher than they are, by their advancementeither in the Church or the commonwealth." Hispersuasions were effective, the proposal was embraced,and the monastery of All Hallows, in the immediatePerrot s Life. f Rot. Pat. in Cane. Hib.246 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.vicinity of the city, was, with all its precincts, grantedfor the foundation. Doctor Loftus thereupon employedHenry Ussher, afterwards Archbishop of Armagh,to solicit the queen for her royal charter, anda mortmain licence for the land so granted ; the emissarywas successful, and soon returned with a warrant,dated the 29th day of December, 1591, authorizingthe incorporation of a university, with the power ofholding the granted lands, and any others that mightbe obtained, to the amount of 400 yearly value, whichconcession was followed by a regular charter, wherebythe college was erected as mother of a university, bythe style of "The College of the Holy and UndividedTrinity of Queen Elizabeth, near Dublin ;" to consistof a provost, three fellows, and three scholars : LordBurleigh was named first chancellor, and this prelate,then also Lord Chancellor of Ireland, was nominatedthe first provost, which office he continued to enjoy until1594, when he resigned it, the queen having firstgiven a licence for his so doing, and in which she expressedher great satisfaction in his administration.The object of this foundation, as expressed in theQueen s letter to the lord deputy, was, that thereby"knowledge, learning and civility may be increasedamongst the Irish, and their children s children, especiallythose that be poor, may have their learning andeducation given them with much more ease and lessercharge than in other universities they can obtain it."The foundation has been since enriched by royalgrants of confiscated estates, parliamentary votes, andprivate donations, to an amount well adequate to theADAM Lotus. 247promotion of its legitimate objects. The annual rentalof its extensive estates in the counties of Cork,Kerry, Limerick, and Meath, exclusive of renewalfines, amounts to 13,816 ; it has also extensive patronagein Church livings, and sundry allowances inthe nature of exhibitions from charitable foundations.Its magnificent library has been acquired at littleexpense, by private gifts, the statutable extensionof copyright since 1816, and, in the instance of theFagel library, the entire donation of the trustees ofErasmus Smith s charities. Its manuscript room is sorichly supplied, but at the same time so sealed fromordinary access, that it may well be termed " the cemeteryof Irish history ;" a character, perhaps, too muchin accordance with the constitution of the college itself,for, although it has sundry professors of its ownendowment, and others, as those of divinity, mathematics,astronomy, and political economy, principallyof private foundation, it yet has no professor of thehistory, antiquities, or statistics, moral or physicalresources of the country with which its "alumni"should, in their future lives, be conversant. Jamesthe First urged the propriety of such an appointment;Charles the First warmly approved of it ; Bishop Bedell, while provost, endeavoured to effectuate it; Jamesthe Second actually appointed one ; and a very largebequest was, in more recent years, designed by DoctorFlood for the endowment of such, but his will wasoverruled at law. The reproach, however, of such adeficiency in our Irish university will, it is hoped, bespeedily removed under the liberal administration ofthe present provost, Dr. Sadler.248 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.In the chronological arrangement of these memoirs,it is painful to find Edmund Spencer, in his"View of the State of Ireland" in 1596, thus characterizingthe clergy of the Established Church inIreland. " Whatever disorders you see in the Churchof England, you may find there, and many more,namely, gross simony, greedy covetousness, fleshlyincontinency, careless sloth, and generally all disorderedlife in the common clergyman ; and besidesall these, they have their particular enormities, forall Irish priests, which now enjoy Church livings,they are in a manner mere laymen, saving that theyhave taken holy orders, but otherwise they do go andlive like laymen, follow all kind of husbandry andother worldly affairs as other Irishmen do ; theyneither read Scriptures, nor preach to the people,nor administer the communion, but baptism they do,for they christen, yet after the Popish fashion ; onlythey take the tithes and offerings, and gather whatfruit else they may of their livings, the which theyconvert as badly, and some of them (they say) payas due tributes and shares of their livings to theirbishops, for the Irish bishops have their clergy insuch awe and subjection under them, that they darenot complain of them, so as they may do to themwhat they please ; for they, knowing their own unworthinessand incapacity, and that they are thereforestill removable at their bishops will, yield whatpleaseth him, and he taketh what he listeth ; yea, andsome of them, whose dioceses are in remote parts,somewhat out of the world s eye, do not at all bestowADAM Lotus. 249the benefices which are in their own donation uponany, but keep them in their own hands, and set theirown servants and horse-boys to take up the tithes andfruits of them, with the which some of them purchasegreat lands, and build fair castles upon the same, ofwhich abuse, if any question be moved, they have avery seemly colour and excuse, that they have noworthy ministers to bestow them upon, but keepthem so bestowed for any such sufficient person asany shall bring unto them"*In 1597 Archbishop Loftus was again one of theLords Justices, and once more in 1599, on the remarkableoccasion, when the Earl of Essex, the Viceroy,departed from Ireland, and suddenly appeared beforethe queen in her dressing chamber. At the close ofthe latter year he was named one of the assistantcouncillors to the Lord President of Minister, andin 1603 had pardon of intrusion and alienation, inreference to the manors, &c., of Ilathfarnhani, CallingNewtown, Stagonil, Timothan, Old Court,Kilclogan, Wexford, Hooke, Painstown, le Nags,&c.f In two years afterwards, on the 5th of April,1605, about forty-two years after his consecration,of which nearly thirty-eight were spent in this see,he died at an advanced age in his palace of St.Sepulchre s, and was buried in St. Patrick s Church,at the right hand of the Earl of Cork s monument.It may be remarked, that Anne, the second daughterof this prelate, was married to Sir Henry Colles ofSpencer s View of the State of Ireland, Dub.

Ob. 1619.]Thomas Jones, the son of Sir Roger Jones, Knight,Alderman of London, succeeded on the death ofLoftus ; he was born in Lancashire, and educated inChrist Church College, Cambridge, where he becamea master of arts, but took his degree of doctorof divinity, in that of Dublin, by special grace,in 1614. When he had taken orders he cameover to Ireland, and married Margaret, the daughterof Adam Pardon, Esq., of Lurgan Race in thecounty of Louth, relict of John Douglas, and sisterto the wife of Archbishop Loftus, to which alliancehe was probably indebted for his subsequent promotions;indeed, there was, (as Mr. Mason has remarkedin his History of St. Patrick s Cathedral,) a singularcongruity in the events which befel each of thesepersons. They were educated at the same university,arid ran the race of ambition together, both were deansof St. Patrick s, archbishops of Dublin, chancellorsand lords justices of Ireland ; they married two sisters,and each left a numerous progeny, while the elderbranch of both families was ennobled in the personsof their immediate heirs. Jones s first promotion wasto the chancellorship of St. Patrick s cathedral ; in1581 he was elected its dean, and, while in that office?combined with his chapter to make some of thoseTHOMAS JONES. 251disgraceful demises of the property of the church (asof the manor of Cooling for 81 years to Mr. Allenof Allenscourt), which Dean Swift has so severelycensured.On the 10th of May, 1584, Dean Jones was promotedby letters patent to the see of Meath ; he hadbeen recommended from Ireland, as " a person for hislearning and wisdom, and other virtuous qualities, fit tobe advanced to a bishopric;" and the queen, accordingly,wrote from Westminster to the lords justices tomake out such writings for his election and consecration,and the restitution of the temporalities of thesee of Meath. On the 12th of the above monthhe was consecrated in St. Patrick s Church, and inthe month following was called into the privy councilby her majesty s special direction, communicatedto Sir John Perrot. Having presided over that seeduring twenty-one years, he was, in six months afterthe death of Loftus, promoted to this, King Jameshaving in October, 1605, thus emphatically recommendedhis translation thereto : " Whereas since thedeath of the late archbishop, we have given no orderfor supply of that see, because of same being a placeso eminent within that kingdom, we took time to adviseof a meet person for it, we have since, upon conferencewith divers of our council, found none morefit for the present time than the Bishop of Meath, inregard of his long experience in that kingdom, bothin the ecclesiastical state as a bishop, and in the civilaffairs as a chancellor, wherefore we have madechoice of him, and we are further pleased, that he252 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.shall hold in commendam a prebend which now hehath in possession, which he will nominate untoyou." He, accordingly, retained with this dignitythe prebend of Castleknock, and the rectory ofTrim ; and, in a few days after, was for the samecauses made chancellor by privy seal, which highoffice he held until his death. On the 9th of Novemberhe was consecrated, and on the llth had restitutionof the temporalities.In 1608 this archbishop had the king s letter foragrant of the monastery of the Blessed Virgin ofTristernagh, with all lands thereunto belonging, astheretofore demised by Queen Elizabeth to CaptainWilliam Piers for a certain term then outstanding,*and in 1610 obtained a further grant to himself and hisson Sir Roger Jones, of two waterfalls on the Boyne,near Trim, with the courses and weirs thereunto belonging,parcel of the estate of the late monastery of theBlessed Virgin of Trim; also, a grant of the monasteryof the friars minors observants of Trim, with the site,church, cemetery, water-mill and course, garden, orchard,and other appurtenances, an eel weir on theBoyne, the king s park otherwise the park of Trim,containing eighty acres, and other parks, parcel ofthe estate of said monastery ; also, that religious houseand its site, the church and burial-ground, and thehereditaments within the same, and eighty acres adjoiningthe town and lands of Galroestown, parcel ofthe same estate ; one hundred acres in Ballynascallan,Rot in Cane. Hib.THOMAS JONES. 253parcel of the estate of Walter de la Horde, attainted,a castle, and 200A. at Germantown, &c.In 1611 he and the other archbishops of theEstablished Church held a council in Dublin, whereinit was decreed, that the suffragans should reside intheir respective dioceses, visit all the churches undertheir charge, and institute such regulations as wouldbe best calculated " to prevent sectarianism, and extirpatePopery." It was then also ordained, thatnone should be appointed a minister, without theapprobation of the Lord Lieutenant under the royalseal, that all ecclesiastics should take the oath of supremacy,and that quarterly lists of recusants shouldbe transmitted to the viceroy, as also of all who protectedpriests, or attended their service or ceremonies,that in every diocese there should be a school of thehigher order of learning, and in every town one ofrudiments, all under Protestant tutors, and lastly,that the churches should be repaired at the expenseof the recusants, but for the exclusive service of theestablished religion.*In the following year this prelate was one of thespiritual lords who sat in the parliament, the openingof which is thus strikingly detailed. " On the 18thof May being Tuesday, the Lord Deputy, with allthe peers of the realm and the noblemen, the clergy,both bishops and archbishops, attired in scarlet robesvery sumptuously, with sound of trumpets, the LordDavid Barry, Viscount Buttevant, bearing the swordPorter s Compend.

Eccles., p. 249, &c.254 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.of estate, the Earl of Thomond bearing the cap ofmaintenance, and after all these the Lord Deputyfollowed, riding upon a most stately horse, richlytrapped, himself attired in a very rich and statelyrobe of purple velvet, which the king s majesty hadsent him, having his train borne up by eight gentlemenof worth, and thus 3 in most stately and sumptuousmanner, they rode from the Castle of Dublin to theCathedral Church of St. Patrick, to hear service anda sermon preached by the Reverend father in God,Christopher Hampton, D. D., Archbishop of Armagh,and Primate of all Ireland. But as many of thenobility as were of the recusant faction went not intothe church, neither heard divine service or sermon,notwithstanding that they were lords of the parliamenthouse, and rode towards the church with otherlords of estate, yet they staid without during the timeof service and sermon. Now, when service was done,the Lord Deputy returned back into the Castle, thoserecusant lords joined themselves again with the restof the estate, and rode to the Castle in manner asbefore they came from thence. Now, the LordDeputy, with all this honourable assembly, being enteredinto the Castle ascended up into the high houseof parliament, where he sat down in his chair ofstate 5 likewise, the Lord Chancellor sat down accordingto his estate, also the nobility of the kingdom,the lords spiritual and temporal, every one satdown accordingly. And, when the whole high courtof parliament was set, the Lord Chancellor made agrave and worthy speech, concerning many greatTHOMAS JONES. 255and worthy causes of estate, there to be debated uponfor the good of the kingdom and for the commonwealththereof"*In 1613 Archbishop Jones was one of the justicesin commission with Sir Richard Whitfield, Marshalof Ireland; in 1614 he had a grant of the temporalitiesof the bishoprics of Gilmore and Ardagh duringvacancy. In that year also occurred a new taxation ofthis diocese, in which three of the dignities were revaluedand reduced in that estimate ; and three prebendaldignities valued for the first time. DoctorJones was again in commission as lord justice in 1615,jointly with Sir John Dunham, Chief Justice of theKing s Bench ; and, in the parliament of the latteryear, was appointed to act as proxy for the Archbishopof Tuam. The regal visitation of that year reportedthis diocese as of the annual value of 450, while itcontains the following remarks by the archbishop onthe state of the deaneries of Omurrough and Wicklow,and the diocese generally. " I confess there is but aslender account yielded of these two last deaneries,which lie in places remote. I humbly pray my trueexcuse may be considered, which is, that I cannot possiblyget curates to supply the service of thesechurches ; the rectories are impropriate, and the farmerscannot be drawn to yield any competent means toa minister for serving the cure ; besides, if we couldget means, we cannot possibly get ministers, for thenatives of this kingdom, being generally addicted toDesid. Curios. Hib, vol. i. p. 166.256 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.Popery, do train up their children in superstition andidolatry ; so soon as they come to age they send thembeyond the seas, from whence they return eitherpriests, Jesuits, or seminaries, enemies to the religionestablished, and pernicious members to the state. SuchEnglish ministers and preachers, as come hither out ofEngland, we do but take them upon credit, and manytimes they prove of a dissolute life, which doth muchhurt. I do humbly desire a small supply of ministers,and I will have an especial care of their placing inthe best manner I can. Some livings are fallenvoid since the beginning of this visitation, for which Iknow not how to provide incumbents for the present.This is our case; I might add hereunto, that my archiepiscopaljurisdiction was granted away by my predecessorto a civilian ; and the grant was confirmed byboth the deans and chapters. My jurisdiction hathnot yielded me any means or profit (save only myproxies since my preferment to this see,) in which timeI have furnished all the churches of Dublin with sufficientpreachers which before they did want ; Ihave preferred none but good preachers in my cathedralchurch or other part. I take God to witness Ihave used my best endeavours to plant a good ministry,and my care and travel shall be still employed toperform his majesty s religious directions, and to dischargea good conscience before God. So in this diocesethere are preachers in number thirty-eight orthirty-nine, of which thirty-two are resident; readingministers about forty. I have placed three preachersin void livings since my return; besides there areTHOMAS JONES. 257two public schoolmasters in this diocese, one in thecity of Dublin, and the other in St. Patrick s, whichteach free schools, and their scholars do prosper well,thanks be to God. It is worthy of remark, that theabove record enumerates, amongst the then whollyunprofitable benefices, those of Athy, Grangerosnol-van, Began, Castledermot, Glendalough, Grand,Moon, Violin, Narraghmore, Kilcullen, Wicklow,Arklow, Templemichael, &c. In the same year, asstated in the notes to Curry s Historical Review,(Dublin edition, p. 86,) eight Roman Catholics, whohad been excommunicated by this prelate for recusancy,and imprisoned, were released by the indulgenceof parliament ; but, on being again excommunicatedby Doctor Jones, they were sent back to theirformer place of confinement.In the November of 1617, the mayor and commonsof Dublin procured an act of state against certaininhabitants of St. Patrick s liberties, who soldgoods without licence from the city of Dublin ; butthis order, which had been obtained when the archbishopwas absent from the council, was, on his representation,suspended, it being proved to be a directinfringement of the dean and chapter s privileges,whose rights the mayor and commons had upon thisoccasion concealed. In the same year, this prelatehad a grant from the crown of the wardship ofPatrick, son and heir of William Bermingham, thenlate of Corballis, at a certain annual rent, " retainingthereout 7 9s. 6d. 9 for his maintenance andeducation in religion and habits, and in Trinitys258 ARCHBISHOPS OF Dublin.College, Dublin, from the twelfth to the eighteenthyear of his age."Archbishop Jones, during his episcopacy, repaireda great part of Christ Church which had fallen downin his time ; he also restored the steeple, then greatlydecayed, and placed upon it three weather-cocks, thememory of which benefactions was preserved by aninscription on the walls of that cathedral long sincedefaced. He died at his palace of St. Sepulchre s,in April, 16 19? having governed this see upwards ofthirteen years, and was buried beside his wife in St.Patrick s Church near the communion table, where abeautiful monument was erected to his memory by hisheir, and which was subsequently repaired at theinstance of Dean Swift, whose laudable exertions inrenovating the edifice over whose economy he presided,have only been paralleled by the judicious andliberal expenditure of the present dignitary, DeanDawson. Archbishop Jones, during the period ofhis several promotions, not only laid the foundationof a large estate, but likewise so recommended his sonto royal favour, that he was, in a few years after hisfather s demise, created Viscount Ranelagh, and BaronJones of Naval ; the first of which titles has been sinceenlarged into an earldom.LANCELOT Berkeley.[Succ. 1619. Ob. 1650.]Lancelot Berkeley, Doctor of Divinity, of theUniversity of Dublin, was the eleventh and youngestLANCELOT BULKELEY. 259son of Sir Richard Berkeley of Beauvais, by hissecond wife Agnes, daughter of Thomas Needham,and acquired his education at Brazen-nose College,Oxford; into which he was admitted a commoner in1587, in the eighteenth year of his age. He afterwardsremoved to St. Edmund s Hall, where he tookthe successive degrees of bachelor and master of arts,and was in November, 1593, ordained deacon byHugh Ballot, bishop of Bangor, in a private oratoryin that prelate s palace, being then also licensedto preach ; he was on the same day instituted to therectory of Llandyfnan, in the March following to thatof Beauvais, and immediately afterwards ordainedpriest in the cathedral of Bangor, by the same bishop.Having for a short time filled the archdeaconry ofDublin, he was promoted to its see in 16 19, withthe usual mandates for investiture, consecration, andrestitution. He was accordingly consecrated atDrogheda in St. Peter s Church, on the 3rd ofOctober in that year, by Christopher, Archbishop ofArmagh, assisted by the Bishops of Gilmore androsand was soon afterwards called into the privycouncil by King James, who early in the followingyear granted him a licence to hold in commendationone or more ecclesiastical benefices, not exceeding theannual value of 100 sterling in the king s books.In 1621 this prelate granted to Christopher andRichard Fagan the office of constable of the castle ofSwords, with certain lands annexed.* In 1623 heRot in Cane. His226 ) ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.revived the controversy concerning the primacy withDoctor Hampton, 6t on the ground, that a Protestantking and council would confirm the patent grantedby a Protestant king to his predecessor Browne, andabolish that of a Popish queen to Primate Dovvdal :the death of Hampton, however, which occurredsoon after, silenced the dispute for that time." ;V? In1626 Berkeley petitioned King Charles, setting forth,that whereas before the dissolution of abbeys theArchbishops of Dublin, from time to time at theirordinary visitations, received the yearly sum of 13Irish, for proxies issuing out of, or payable forchurches belonging to the abbey of St. Thomas theMartyr beside Dublin ; 6 Ss. for proxies chargeableupon the hospital of St. John of Jerusalem, and5 6s. Sd. Irish, out of the monastery of St. Marythe Virgin beside Dublin ; which several proxies,upon the dissolution, were reserved by an act ofparliament to the then archbishop and his successors,by virtue whereof he and his predecessors had eversince received the said proxies at the hands of thevice-treasurer, until the last establishment made bythe advice of the late commissioners in Ireland, who,supposing the same to be a pension granted to him,left the same out of the establishment; and, therefore,prayed his majesty s letters, directing the vice-treasurerand receiver-general to pay the said proxies,together with the arrears thereof, which was accordinglydone under the authority of letters from theWare s Bishops, p.LANCELOT BULKELEY. 261privy council of England, dated at Whitehall, 21st ofJune, 1626. In the same year he renewed the disputeabout the primacy with Archbishop Ussher,upon which occasion King Charles directed letters tothe Lord Deputy Falkland and the privy council, toexamine into and finally determine the difference,that the scandal arising from such an unseemlycontention between prelates might be avoided; butnothing was done in pursuance of this command, until1634, a little before the meeting of parliament, whenthe Lord Deputy Stratford summoned the two archbishopsbefore the council board, and, for two severaldays, examined narrowly, viewed the records, andheard all that could be alleged on either side, andthen declared, that it appeared as well by the testimonyof Bernard in the life of Malachy, as by theold Roman provincials, and divers other evidences,that the see of Armagh had from all antiquity beenacknowledged the prime see of the whole kingdom, andthe archbishop thereof reputed not a provincial primate,(like the other three metropolitan,) but national,i. e., the sole primate of Ireland properly so called ;that in the reign of Queen Elizabeth the Archbishopof Dublin, (not being chancellor,) both at the councilboard and in the execution of the high commission,even for such things as properly concerned thediocese of Dublin itself, did constantly subscribe afterthe Archbishop of Armagh ; that in the statute madefor the erection of free schools in the 12th of Elizabeth,the Archbishop of Armagh is nominated beforethe Archbishop of Dublin, as he is in that of the262 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN,27th of Elizabeth, where all the archbishops and bishopswere ranked in their order, as appeared by theparliament rolls; for which reason he decreed thatthe Archbishop of Armagh and his successors forevershould have precedency, and be ranked beforethe Archbishop of Dublin and his successors, as well inparliament and convocation house, as in all other meetings,and in all commissions where they should be mentioned,aud in all places, as well within the diocese orprovince of Dublin as elsewhere, until upon betterproof on the part of the Archbishop of Dublin itshould be adjudged otherwise." And thus was finallyterminated a dispute, which had from time to timeperplexed and disturbed both Church and State forseveral hundred years. After the passing of the actof council, Primate Ussher was commanded to draw upa state of the controversy, and accordingly he wrotea short discourse upon the subject, which is depositedamong the manuscripts of Trinity College,Dublin.At Christmas, 1629 3 in that season which oughtto inspire universal benevolence, Archbishop Berkeleyunder the pretence that the Jesuits and friars ofDublin were infusing sedition amongst the RomanCatholic inhabitants, applied to the Lords Justicesfor a warrant and a file of musketeers to seize theoffenders. Intolerance sat at the council board, amilitary escort was ordered out, but the Carmeliteof Cook-street resisted the execution of the warrant,(as alleged by the author of " Foxes and Firebrands,"one of those scandalous pamphlets, that in every ageLANCELOT BULKELEY. 263are found to pander to the prejudices and bad passionsof the ignorant and credulous), and their audience andflock, as might be expected, assailed the soldiers, affrontedthe archbishop, who had arrogated to himselfto be their accuser and their avenger, and obliged himto take shelter in a house. " The Lords Justices thereuponcommitted the Popish aldermen and others of thecitizens, and on the Nth of January following communicatedthe transaction to the privy council of England,who,^on the last day of the same month, issued theirorders for a due execution of the law, and commandedthat the house, where these friars appeared in theirhabits, and where the archbishop received the firstaffront, should be demolished, and left as a markof terror to the resisters of authority, and that therest of the houses of these suspicious societies shouldbe converted to houses of correction and other publicuses ; and further, that all fit means should be usedto discover the founders, benefactors, and maintainersof such societies and colleges, and certify their names,and to find out the lands, leases, or revenues applyingto their uses, and dispose thereof according tothe law, and to certify also the places of all suchmonasteries, priories, nunneries, and other religioushouses, and the names of all such persons as have putthemselves to be brothers and sisters therein, especiallysuch as are of note, to the end such evil plantsbe not permitted to take root any where in thatkingdom. For the supply of munition," it adds,which you have reason to desire, we have taken2(34 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.effectual order that you shall receive it with all convenientspeed. 5 *Notwithstanding all this zeal against service andworship according to the forms of the Church ofHome, it appears that the Articles of that of Englandwere not held or reputed to be those of the Churchof Ireland until I634 5 f and then under the followingsingular circumstances, as detailed in Lord Stafford sState Letters : A convocation was assembled inDublin, " the lower house of which had appointeda select committee to consider the canons of, theChurch of England, and I found," says Straffordthat they did proceed in the examination withoutconferring at all with their bishops ; that they hadgone through the Book of Canons, and noted in themargin such as they allowed with an A, and on othersthey had entered a D, which stood for deliberandum;that in the fifth article they had brought the Articlesof Ireland (of 1615J to be allowed and receivedunder the pain of excommunication ; and that theyhad drawn up their canons into a body, and wereready that afternoon to make report in the convocation.I instantly sent for Dean Andrews, (afterwardsBishop of Ferns,) that reverend clerk who sat forsoothin the chair at this committee, requiring him tobring along the aforesaid book of canons so noted inthe margin, together with the draft he was to presentCabala, vol. ii. p. 241, &c.t See Borlase s Irish Rebellion, p. 238.\ State Letters, vol. i. p. 323.LANCELOT BULKELEY. 265that afternoon to the house. But when I came toopen the book and ran over their deliberations in themargin, I confess I was not so moved since I cameinto Ireland ; I told him certainly not a dean of Limerick,but an Ananias, had sat in the chair of thatcommittee; however sure I was, an Ananias had beenthere in spirit if not in body, with all the fraternitiesand conventicles of Amsterdam, that I was ashamedand scandalized with it above measure. I thereforesaid he should leave the book and draft with me, andthat I did command him upon his allegiance, heshould report nothing to the house from that committeeuntil he heard again from me. Being thusnettled, I gave present direction for a meeting, andwarned the primate, the Bishops of Meath, Gilmore,Raphoe, and Derry, together with Dean Wesley theprolocutor, and all those who had been of the committeeto be with me the next morning ; then Ipublicly told them how unlike clergymen, that owedcanonical obedience to their superiors, they had proceeded; how unheard a part it was for a few pettyclerks to presume to make articles of faith, withoutthe privity or consent of State or bishop, with a spiritof Brown ism and contradiction. I observed on theirdeliberations, as if indeed they purposed at once totake away all government and order forth of theChurch, and leave every man to choose his own highplace where liked him best ; but those heady and arrogantcourses I was not to endure, nor if they weredisposed to be frantic in this dead and cold season ofthe year, would I suffer them either to be mad in266 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.the convocation or in their pulpits." After which,his lordship declared to them all, that no other questionshould be put at their meeting, but that forallowing and receiving the Articles of the Church ofEngland without admitting any other discourse at all;for that he would no endure that the Articles of theChurch of England should be disputed. "And finally,"proceeds his lordship, " because there should be noquestion in the canon that was thus to be voted, Idid desire my lord primate would be pleased toframe it, and after I had perused it I would send theprolocutor a draft of the canon to be propounded,enclosed in a letter of my own. This meeting thusbroke off, there were some hot spirits sons of thunderamongst them, who moved, that they should petitionme for a free synod ; but in fine they could not agreeamongst themselves who should put the bell aboutthe cat s neck, and so this likewise vanished. Theprimate accordingly framed the canon, which I notso well approving, drew up one myself more after thewords of the canon in England, which I held bestfor me to keep as close too as I could, and then sentitto my lord. His Grace came instantly unto me, andtold me he feared the canon would never pass in suchform as I had made it, but he was hopeful, as he haddrawn it, it might, and besought me therefore tothink a little better of it ; but I confess, having takena little jealousy that his proceedings were not openand free to those ends I had my eye upon, it was toolate now either to persuade or affright me ; I told hislordship I was resolved to put it to them in theseLANCELOT BULKELEY. 267very words, and was most confident there were notsix in the houses that would refuse them, tellinghim by the signal we should see, whether his lordshipor myself better understood their minds on thatpoint, and by that I would be content to be judged.Only for order sake I desired his lordship would votethis canon first in the upper house of convocation,and so voted, then to pass the question beneath also.Without any delay then I writ a letter to Dean Lesley, a copy whereof I likewise send you, with thecanon enclosed, which accordingly that afternoon wasunanimously voted, first with the bishops, and thenby the rest of the clergy, excepting one man, whodid singly deliberate upon the receiving of the Articlesof England." The remarkable canon was inthe following words : " For the manifestation of ouragreement with the Church of England on the confessionof the same Christian faith and doctrine ofthe sacraments, we do receive and approve the bookof Articles of Religion, as agreed upon by the archbishopsand bishops and the whole clergy in theconvocation holden at London, A.

Youhave not only made restitution of that which the iniquityof former ages had bereft us of, but also, asthough you intended to expiate their faults, enrichedus with new and princely endowments, to which infiniteobligations, and many others, we may add yourmajesty s inestimable goodness in providing for us yourpresent deputy, Thomas Viscount Wentworth, a governorso just, careful, provident, and propitious to theChurch. By the act of parliament, (10 Chas. I. sess.3, c. 23,) which confirmed this clerical grant, the collectorsthereof were empowered to enforce its paymentby the authority of the censures of the Church;that is to say, by suspension, excommunication, or interdiction; and also by sequestration of the fruits andprofits of the benefices and promotions spiritual, orby distress on the farmers and occupiers of the landschargeable therewith. In the same session an act waspassed, whereby all archbishops and bishops of thiskingdom, to whom any manors, lands, tithes, pensions,profits, or other hereditaments had been, or shouldthereafter be granted, for the maintenance of any college,school, lecture, &c. ; or for the relief or maintenanceof any poor or impotent persons ; or for thebuilding or repairing of any church, college, school,270 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.or hospital ; or for the maintenance of any preacher ;or the erection or repair of any bridges, causeways,highways, or any other like lawful and charitable use,are compellable in the Court of Chancery to performsaid trusts according to the true intent of the chartersto them made." In the following session an act waspassed (10 & 11 Chas. I. c. 2,) authorizing and facilitatingthe restitution of impropriations and tithesto the clergy, regulating the endowment of perpetualvicars, and the rights of presentation, and prescribingthat all vicars, so endowed, should be chargeable withthe repairs of the chancels of their respective churches.While the next act of the session made all conveyances,leases, and charges by ecclesiastical personsvoid, with certain exceptions.Carte, speaking of the state of the Protestantclergy in Ireland at this time, says, "scandalous livingsnaturally make scandalous ministers, the clergy of theEstablished Church were generally ignorant and unlearned,loose and irregular in their lives and conversations,negligent of their cures, and very careless ofobserving uniformity and decency in divine worship"*While Lord Wentworth, in a letter to ArchbishopLaud, described them as an " unlearned clergy whichhave not so much as the outward form of churchmento cover themselves with, nor their persons any waysreverenced or protected, the churches unbuilt, theparsonage and vicarage houses utterly ruined, the peopleuntaught through the non-residency of the clergy,Life of Ormondee, vol. i. p. 68.LANCELOT BULKELEY. 271occasioned by the unlimited shameful numbers ofspiritual promotions with cure of souls which theyhold by commendam, the rites and ceremonies ofthe Church run over without all decency of order,habit, or gravity in the course of their service, thepossessions of the Church to a great proportion in layhands, the bishops altering their very principal housesand demesnes to their children, to strangers, and farmingout their jurisdictions to mean and unworthypersons, the Popish titulars exercising the while aforeign jurisdiction much greater than theirs"*In 1635 Archbishop Bulkeleyhad a confirmationfrom the king to him, and his successors, of all formergrants, liberties, and privileges belonging to the see.This charter very fully details in particular the extentand privileges of the manor of St. Sepulchre sand its liberties.In 1039 an act of parliament was passed, whereby,after reciting that the ancient glebes of churchescould not be found, through the war and confusion offormer times in this kingdom," it was enacted thatany devout person might, without any licence of mortmain,endow churches having no glebes, or having notabove 10A. of glebe, with new glebe, provided thetotal glebe of any one church so endowed should notexceed 40A. at the most.

The CommonsJournals of the immediately succeeding years affordabundant evidence, as amongst the grievances votedby parliament, of the scandalous extortions sanctionedin the ecclesiastical courts under the pretext of exactingdues for services revered in the old establishment,but unpractised and condemned as idolatryby the reformers. In the emphatic language of thepetition of the Ulster dissenters, " the prelates andtheir faction, as they inherit the superstition of thePopery, so of late, they exact with all severity theobsolete customs of St. Mary s gallons, mortuaries,&c., which, as they were given by superstition andvised to idolatry, so now they are taken by oppressionand applied to riotousness"*In June, 1646, this prelate was one of the councilwho signed and issued the proclamation confirmatoryof the peace concluded in that month, between theMarquis of Ormondee and the Roman Catholics, " inthe hope conceived by his Majesty, that it may preventfurther effusion of his subjects blood, redeemthem out of all the miseries and calamities underwhich they now suffer, restore them to all quietnessand happiness under his Majesty s most gracious government,deliver the kingdom in general from thoseslaughters, depredations, rapines, and spoils, whichalways accompany a war, encourage the, subjects andothers with comfort to betake themselves to trade,traffic, commerce, manufacture, and all other thingsPin.

The clergyof the Established Church, who had gathered intoDublin while it was occupied by Ormondee, protestedagainst this order, and presented a remonstrance tothe commissioners, but without success. The directorywas adopted throughout the city, and the Bookof Common Prayer only continued to be used in theChapel of Trinity College, then accounted in thesuburbs. In two years afterwards, however, whenArchbishop Berkeley preached his farewell sermon tohis clergy in St. Patrick s Cathedral, at which werepresent, the two Parry, John and Benjamin, bothof whom were subsequently bishops of Ossory,Thomas Steele, afterwards Provost of Trinity Collegeand Dean of St. Patrick s, Mr. Boswell, Prebendaryof St. John s, c., the Common Prayer was read byWilliam Ellsworth, minister; but for doing so, theusurping powers visited them with severe punishment,not only committing the archbishop but allwho were present to prison. Nor did the hostilityof the usurping powers to this prelate cease eventhere ; immediately afterwards, at the close of the274 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.same year, (8th of March, old style,) an act waspassed by the English parliament, whereby, " for theencouragement and increase of learning, and the trueknowledge and worship of God, and the advancementof the Protestant religion in Ireland," it wasenacted that all the honors, castles, lordships, manors,&c., which theretofore belonged to the late Archbishopof Dublin, and to the late dean and chapter of St. Patricks, (treating them as persons who had abdicatedtheir respective dignities,) and the farm of Ardbracken,with the parsonage of Trim, belonging to the bishopricof Meath, should be, and were thereby vestedin Henry Ireton, President of Munster, WilliamBasil, Esq., Attorney General for Ireland, ColonelEnables, Sir Robert King, Colonel Henry Cromwell,John Cooke, Esq., Doctor Henry Jones, DoctorJonathan Goddard, Colonel Jerome Sankey,&c., their heirs and assigns for ever, in trust for thebetter support of Trinity College, the erection andmaintenance of a second College in Dublin, and thefounding of a free school with suitable masters, &c.,to be appointed by the Lord Lieutenant. On theday in which this act was passed, the same parliamententered into resolutions for the abolition of the hierarchyin Ireland, and the discontinuance of the Bookof Common Prayer there.Spent with grief for the calamities of thetimes, and the sufferings of his Church, DoctorBerkeley departed this life at Tallagh, on the 8th ofSeptember, 1650, in the eighty-second year of hisage. His body was conveyed thence, and buried inJAMES MAUGETSON.St. Patrick s Cathedral under the communion table.He left several children by his wife Alice, who wasthe daughter of Roland Berkeley of Conway, but hisonly known literary production was a pamphlet, entitled,Proposals for sending back the Nobility andGentry of Ireland," now extremely scarce, althoughits circulation had but little efficacy.JAMES MARGETSON.[Succ. 1660. Resign. 1663.]This see, during ten years after the death ofBerkeley, was unrepresented in the Protestant hierarchy,but, on the Restoration, James Margetson,Doctor of Divinity, was promoted thereto by KingCharles s letters patent, dated 25th of January inthe twelfth year of his reign, and his mandate forconsecration, writ of restitution, and mesne profitsissued the same day. He had, on the preceding 18thof January, been advanced to the treasurership ofSt. Patrick s, Dublin, and his grant of the prelacycontained a permission to hold that dignity as incommendam, together with the rectory of Gallons,alias D-aYtree, in the county of Monaghan and dioceseof Clogher, and the prebend of Desertion in St.Finbar s Cathedral, Cork.Doctor Margetson was born in 1600 at Drigh-langton, in Yorkshire, and received his education inPeter House College, Cambridge, whence he waspromoted to the parish of Atlas in his own county.Here he attracted the notice of Lord Viscount2/6 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.Wentworth, afterwards Earl of Strafford, who, onbeing appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland, broughthim over with him in 1633, and obliged him to resignhis parish in Yorkshire. In 1635 he was presentedto the rectory and vicarage of Armagh, inGilmore diocese ; was afterwards advanced to thedeanery of Waterford ; in 1637 to that of Derry ;and in 1639 was made Dean of Christ ChurchDublin, pro-vice chancellor of the university there,and prolocutor of the lower house of convocation.Throughout the troubled period of 1641, his charityand benevolence to the sufferers were singularlyeminent. In July 1647 he joined in a remonstranceto the commissioners of the English Parliament,praying liberty for the use of the CommonPrayer in their respective churches, and rejecting thedirectory ordered to be used in lieu thereof; soon afterwhich the war obliged him to fly to England, where,however, he encountered unexpected evils, as greatand general as those from which he had fled. Atlength, having been taken by the parliamentaryparty, he was thrown into Manchester gaol, and hurriedfrom prison to prison, until ultimately he wasreleased in exchange for three or four officers. Heafterwards retired to London, as the most private andsafe retreat, but not with any view to decline aidingthe royal cause where his ability could promote it.Accordingly, during the protectorate, many noblemenand gentlemen of the king s party, who darednot appear publicly in the matter themselves, privatelyemployed him as a person of an inviolate in-JAMES MARGETSON. 2/7t egrity, to distribute their alms to the needy andreduced cavaliers. Although the dangers were manythat attended this employment, yet he undertook itwith the greatest cheerfulness, and discharged it withthe utmost fidelity, travelling through England andWales many times upon this errand, and relievingalso numbers, both of the clergy and others, whowere reduced to the severest poverty. Among theobjects of this, his benevolence, was Chappel, Bishopof Cork and Ross, a refugee upon the same account.It was while wrestling with the adversities and dangersof this period of his life, that, according to his biographer," he happened on a gentleman sick and on hisdeath bed, to whom he administered spiritual comforts,together with the holy offices of the Church on suchoccasions. By that dying person he was told, that hehad been sometimes one near on attendance on thatlate sacred martyr King Charles the First in his solitude,that to him had been by the king delivered, andcommitted to his charge and care to be preserved,those papers which he said he knew to have beenwritten by the king s own hand, and which were afterpublished with the title of EIKflN BA2IAIKHVWhen King Charles the Second was restored tothe throne of his ancestors, Doctor Margetson wasselected to fill the metropolitan chair of this province,and was accordingly consecrated its archbishop in St.Patrick s Cathedral, on the 27th of January, 1660,being the very remarkable occasion when elevenother prelates were also consecrated for the ecclesiasticalservice of Ireland. In the same year he made278 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.a visitation of the church of Penkridge, in Staffordshire,the manor and advowson of which had been,as before mentioned, granted to Archbishop deLoundres, and enjoyed by his successors. In 1661,the declaration requiring all persons " to conform toChurch government by episcopacy, and to the liturgyas established by law, having been adopted by thelords, on the motion of Lord Montgomery of theArts, (who had twice solemnly sworn in the covenantto extirpate prelacy,) and having been on the followingday agreed to by the commons, it was read, underthe sanction of this prelate, by all the ministers ofDublin in their respective churches, and afterwardssimilarly promulgated through the kingdom.In 1662 this prelate enforced the principle ofjurisdiction and control over the pulpits of his diocese,as has been recently asserted by the presentArchbishop Whateley. The reader, who may feelinterested in the details of the occurrence, will findthem in Kenneth Register, p. 784, &c. In thesame year an act was passed (14 & 15 Char. II.c. 10.,) authorizing the chief governor of Ireland, withthe approbation of the respective archbishops andbishops, and the consent of the patrons and incumbents,to unite and divide parishes, to change thesites of churches or of free schools of royal or diocesanfoundation, to exchange glebes, inappropriatebenefices, and to unite presentative benefices to sinecures,saving always the rights of presentation orcollation. In the same session the prelates and clergyof Ireland granted to the king " eight whole andJAMES MARGETSON. 279entire subsidies of four shillings in the pound, to betakenand levied off all and singular the promotionsspiritual within the same kingdom." At this timeMargetson was one of the spiritual peers who votedfor the third reading of the Act of Settlement.During the time he presided over this see, he liberallycontributed to the repair of both its cathedrals ;but this interval was short, and in 1663, on the deathof Primate Bramhall, he was translated to the provinceof Armagh by letters patent, dated the 29th of August,1663, and on the same day had his writ of restitutionto the temporalities, with a grant of themesne profits from the death of his predecessor. Hewas also soon afterwards chosen Vice Chancellor ofTrinity College, Dublin, a dignity which he heldduring his life.He died in August, 1678, and was buried inChrist Church. " As to his private estate and fortunes,"said Doctor Henry Jones, Bishop of Meath,in his funeral sermon, " God blessed him in thatabundantly. It was objected to him that in Englandhe had laid out what he had acquired in Ireland, andnot there rather where he had it; but it is wellknown that even in Ireland he laid out for a settlementfor one of his children no less than 4,000 atonce, and the like sum of 4,000 more towards thesettlement there of another of his children. He wasalso on purchasing not far off an estate, sold afterfor 6,000, which he might have had cheaper ; butrefused to deal in it, understanding part of it to beabbey land. For in all his laying out wheresoever.ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.he was always careful not to meddle with any concernof the Church, nor with tithes, nor with what did belongto abbeys, having oft observed the evil of thatto their possessors." He erected a free school atDrighlington, in Yorkshire, his birth-place, and endowedit with a large yearly revenue for ever.MICHAEL BOYLE.[Succ. 1663. Resign. 1678.]Michael Boyle, successor of Archbishop Marketswas the son of Richard Boyle, Archbishop ofTuam. In 1637 he was incorporated master of arts atOxford, subsequently took the degree of doctor ofdivinity in the University of Dublin, and in 1640 wasmade Dean of Cloyne. Lord Castlehaven, in hisMemoirs, relates an interesting circumstance connectedwith him at this period of his life, or rather inthe year 1644, when that nobleman made his rendezvousat Colonel. Thither," he writes, cameDean Boyle, who was then married to my LordInhciquin s sister ; his business was to persuade meto spare Doneraile and other houses and castles nottenable ; I answered, that I desired it as much as he,though hitherto they had annoyed the country equallyas if they had been strong ; I told him, in short, Ihad orders to take all I could, and such as I thoughtnot fit to garrison to destroy; yet, if he pleased tocause the garrisons to be drawn out, and by lettersfrom the owners to put them into my hands, I wouldappoint some few men unto them, with commandersMICHAEL BOYLE. 281in whom I most confided, and would make it mybusiness to intercede to the council to preserve them.The dean and I parted good friends ; but whether hecould prevail or no with my Lord Inchiquin or theowners I know not, but I heard no more from him."In 1660 this divine was, by letters patent, advanced tothe sees of Cork, Cloyne, and Ross, having been a littlebefore called into the privy council, and was one of thetwelve bishops, who, as before alluded to, were consecratedtogether in St. Patrick s Church,after the Restoration.Not content with the aforesaid three bishoprics,he held possession ofsix parishes in the western portionof his diocese, as sinecures, under colour that he couldnot get clergymen to serve them, in consequence ofwhich he received a very severe reproof from his relative,Roger Earl of Orrery, Lord President of Minister.In 1663 he was translated to the archbishopricof Dublin, with writ of restitution of its temporalities,and a grant of the mesne profits from the translationof his predecessor, and of the same preferments whichhe had held in commendam.For Doctor Boyle was more peculiarly reserved theenjoyment of beholding his Church, as it were, risingout of its own ruins. In 1665 were passed the acts forthe uniformity of public prayer, the administration ofsacraments, and other rites and ceremonies, and for establishingthe form of making, ordaining, and consecratingbishops, priests, and deacons in the Church ofIreland; the act for assessing ministers money incities and corporate towns, the act for disabling spiritualpersons from holding benefices or ecclesiastical282 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.dignities in England or Wales, and in Ireland at thesame time, and the act for abolishing unreasonableforms of tithings and oblations and settling a tablethereof. In 1667 the prelate himself had a grant tohim and his successors of the town and lands of Jor-danton in the parish of Swords, with other landstherein; also of Collision, Great and Little Roween,Kilruske, &c., in the counties of Dublin and Cork ;*and, by the Act of Settlement, had a further confirmationof the lands of his see, together with an augmentationof so much of the forfeited lands as shouldincrease the total income of the dioceses of Dublinand Glendalough, over and above certain manors andmensal lands, to the yearly value of 2,000; and in1668 he and the respective deans of his two cathedrals,had a grant of several impropriations, rectories,and tithes in the counties of Longford, Galway, Mayo,Limerick, Westmeath, Cork, Kilkenny, and Wexford,to hold in trust to the use of the vicars andchairmen of Christ Church and St. Patrick s. fHaving repaired and considerably beautified thepalace of St. Sepulchre s, while he resided there, hewas translated to Armagh by the king s letter, datedthe 27th of January, 1678, with which last prefermenthe held the chancellorship of Ireland for twenty-twoyears. He sat in King James s parliament in 1689?and dying in 1702, was buried at midnight in St.Patrick s Cathedral under the altar. The town ofBlessings, in the county of Wicklow, was foundedRot. Pat. in Cane. Hib. f Rot. in Cane. Hib.JOHN PARKER. 283by him, and there he erected a magnificent countryhouse, a domestic chapel, and a parish church. Thetitle of Viscount Blessings was in consequencegranted to his son, Borough Boyle, who raised a veryhandsome cenotaph to the memory of his father, inSt. Mary s Church, in that town.JOHN PARKER.[Succ. 1678. Ob. 1651.]John Parker, the son of John Parker, prebendaryof Maynooth, and born in Dublin, was in 1642 madea petty canon of St. Patrick s, and subsequently Prebendaryof St. Michan s, and Dean of Killala, whereuponhe took his degree of bachelor of divinity inTrinity College, Dublin, and was chaplain to theMarquis, afterwards Duke of Ormondee, while lordlieutenant of Ireland. In 1649 Cromwell causedhim to be stripped of all his preferments and castinto prison, on suspicion of having been employed asaspy by the marquis, who was then labouring toreduce Dublin to the king s obedience. After somemonths, however, Ormondee procured his enlargement,and zealously patronized him until his withdrawalinto France, when Parker likewise removedto England. On the Restoration this divine waspromoted to the bishopric of Elphin, whence he wastranslated in 1667 to Tuam, and in 1678 from thatdignity to the archdiocese of Dublin, whereupon hewas admitted into the privy council. With his seeslie held in commendam the rectory of Gallons, alias284 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.Darted, in the county of Monaghan, the treasurershipof St. Patrick s, Dublin, and the prebend ofDesertion, in the church of St. Finbar, in the dioceseof Cork.He died on the 28th of December, 1681, atSt. Sepulchre s, Dublin, and was buried in ChristChurch, Michael Boyle, Archbishop of Armagh, hispredecessor in this see, performing the last office.By his will, dated 27th of April, 1 680, he devised tothe poor of Elphin 12, to the poor of Tuam 10,to the poor of St. Sepulchre s, Dublin, 20, toChrist Church in that city 40 to buy a pair ofsilver candlesticks for the communion table, and tothe Blue Boys Hospital in Oxmantown 50. Duringthe ensuing vacancy of the see Sir John Topham,Vicar General, was by both chapters chosen guardianof the spiritualities.FRANCIS MARSH.[Succ. 1681. Ob. 1693.]Parker s successor, Francis Marsh, Doctor ofDivinity, of the University of Dublin, was born inGloucestershire, in October, 1627? and educated inthe free school of Gloucester, " where he made suchearly and nimble advances in grammatical learning,that by thirteen years of age he was fit to be admittedinto Emanuel College, Cambridge, whence he waselected into a fellowship in Glanville and Caius College,in which latter society he continued till therestoration of the royal family. On the promotionof Doctor Jeremy Taylor to the united sees of DownFRANCIS MARSH. 285and Connor in 1660, Marsh was immediately sentfor by that prelate, who put him into deacon s andpriest s orders, and in the same year procured forhim a presentation to the deanery of St. Saviour sof Connor. In the following year (19th of June,1661) he was advanced by the influence of LordChancellor Hide to the deanery of Armagh, and onthe 31st of March, 1664, to the archdeaconry ofDromore, < plena jure, with a clause of union of thesame to the deanery of Armagh, in which prefermentshe continued until his promotion to the seesof Limerick, Ardent, and Aghadoe, in 1667, whencehe was translated in 1672 to those of Gilmore andArdagh, and thence to this dignity by the king sletter, dated 14th of February, 1681 ; in a few daysafter which he was enthroned in St. Patrick s, Dublin.The visitation sermon preached upon this occasionby his grace s chaplain, Doctor Samuel Foley, ispreserved, and contains sentiments of Christian charity,which it had been well were more frequentlyreiterated on such occasions. " Let us not," said thepreacher, " under pretence of zeal against Popery,countenance or support a faction, or out of a projectof an impossible union put people in the head todesire that all ecclesiastical laws be taken away,and that they be allowed to do what they please.The second duty I conceive at this time to be verynecessary is, that of love and peace amongst ourselves; a kingdom divided against itself, our Saviourtells us, cannot stand. We are all brethren and sonsof the same mother. Let us therefore love as brethren,and be of the same mind If there beARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.any among us, who will not endure that others dodiffer from them in opinion, and will make their ownsentiments the rule of faith, they are to be pitied,and desired to reflect on the many sects and divisionswhich were among the ancient philosophers and laterdisputing Christians, on the common infirmity of humannature, and on their own many frailties, andto remember that it is not modest to impose magisteriallyall their own dreams or borrowed fancies uponothers, on pain of being declared heretical if theyreceive them not, or to think that all men are blindor unconcerned how matters go, but they. . . . Letus do our own duties, be holy and innocent in ourlives, laborious and industrious in our cures, resoluteand unshaken in our loyalty and our faith, in perfectlove and charity with one another, and entirely conformableto our legal constitutions."Doctor Marsh, during the whole time of his fillingthis dignity, held with it the same preferments whichhis immediate predecessor had enjoyed, and in 1686,on being installed in the chapter as treasurer of St.Patrick s, took the oath of canonical obedience to thedean ; he afterwards however, separated the treasurershipfrom his preferments, in favour of his son onwhom he conferred it. In the same year, on the arrivalof Lord Tyrconnel to take upon him the governmentof this country, it was at this prelate s palacethe council was assembled to receive him, and thereLord Clarendon (who had by particular favour beendirected to retain the government for one week afterTyrconnel s landing) surrendered the sword to theFRANCIS MARSH. 287new viceroy, "with an admirable speech, settingforth his exact observance of the commands of theking, his master, and faithful discharging of thatgreat trust which had been committed to him, andconcluding with his impartial administration of justiceto all parties, in those or the like words addressed toTyrconnel, that, as he had kept an equal hand ofjustice to the Roman Catholics, so, he hoped his lordshipwould to the Protestants; never was a swordwashed with so many tears as this ; " and in truth, ifimpartiality could bind the people of Ireland, theannals of its viceroyalty afford few instances of oneso well inclined to serve them by that qualificationon almost all occurrences, as the illustrious noblemanfor whom such universal regard was avowed on thisoccasion.During the administration of Clarendon s successor,Archbishop Marsh, feeling he had not the materialsof character to uphold him through those stirringtimes, fled to England with his wife and threechildren, substituting on this occasion the celebratedDoctor William King, as his commissary to visit andsuperintend the diocese in his absence. King, however,believing his commission not legally executed,declined the office and procured the two chapters toelect Anthony Dopping, Bishop of Meath, administratorof the spiritualism during the absence of thearchbishop, and, in conjunction with that prelate, hegoverned the see, and supplied with curates suchparishes as had been deserted by the Protestant incumbents.On the expulsion of James the Second,288 ARCHBISHOPS OF Dublin.Archbishop Marsh returned to Ireland, and in theJanuary following held a visitation at St. Patrick s,which was attended only by the prebendaries of Ago,St. Audeon s, Howth, Tipperkevin,andStagonil; andthis and another held in the following month, werethe only meetings of the chapter of St. Patrick suntil after the battle of the Boyne. This acknowledgeddesertion of their cures by the Protestantclergy in the time of James, is strongly contrastedwith the devoted adhesion of the Roman Catholicpriests to their parishes and flocks during the reignof William the Third, as related by Schomberg. " Ido not find," says the marshal in a letter to thelatter monarch, dated in December, 168Q 5 " that theministers apply themselves enough to their duty,whilst the Romish priests are passionate to exhort thepeople to die for the Church of Rome, in puttingthemselves at their head"* And Lord Clarendon, inone of his letters to the Archbishop of Canterbury,tells his grace, " that very few of the clergy residedin their cures, but employed pitiful curates, whichnecessitated the people to look after a Romish priestor a nonconformist preacher, of both which therewas plenty."*j* It may be also mentioned, that QueenMary, in a letter to King William, in July, 1690,uses the remarkable words, " I must put you in mindof one thing, believing it now the season, (the kingwas then in Ireland,) which is, that you would takeDalrymple s Memoirs, vol. iii. p. 59. f Id. vol. i. p. 223.FRANCIS MARSH. 289care of the Church in Ireland, every body agrees thatit is the worst in Christendom"*While Doctor Marsh filled this dignity, he, at hisown expense, considerably beautified and enlargedthe palace of St. Sepulchre s, where on the 16th ofNovember, 1693, he died of apoplexy, and wasburied in Christ Church near the communion table ;his funeral sermon having been preached by DoctorDopping, Bishop of Meath, who gives him the characterof having been a prelate greatly skilled in theGreek language, and in the Stoic philosophy, affable,mild, grave, and of an untameable life. " Tisan argument," added Doctor Dopping on this occasion"of an extraordinary providence as well as ofgreat merit, that preferments drop into the mouthsof some, when others are forced to court like coymistresses, and after all meet with disappointment ;but this archbishop has been rather courted by prefermentsthan a solicitor of them, which ought thereforeto give a due value and esteem to his memoryand reputation." On his death, this see was offeredto Doctor Thomas Venison, afterwards Archbishop ofCanterbury, a promotion which it is said he was willingto accept, and in the contemplation of it requestedKing William, " in behalf of the poor Irishclergy," that the forfeited impropriations belongingto the estates of the Roman Catholics might be allrestored to the respective parish churches; and his Majestyconsidered it a reasonable proposition, but someDalrymple s Memoirs, vol. iii. p. 154.U290 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.unforeseen difficulties arising, the project was notcarried into execution.NARCISSUS MARSH.[Succ. 1694. Resign. 1702.]Narcissus Marsh, Doctor of Divinity, was bornat Harrington, near Highworth in Wiltshire, in December,1638. He was descended, in the paternalline, from a Saxon family of his name, long previouslysettled in Kent, out of which county hisgreat-grandfather removed to the place of this prelates birth. The first rudiments of this divine s educationwere likewise received at Highworth, whence,having been well fitted out for the university, hewas received into Magdalen Hall in Oxford in thebeginning of July, 1654, and in June, 1658, waselected probationer fellow of Exeter Hall. In July,1660, he took his degree of master of arts ; in December,1 667 5 that of bachelor of divinity, and at last, thatof doctor of divinity, on the 23rd of June, 1671 9 towhich degree he was also admitted in the Universityof Dublin in February, 1678. During these periodshe was made chaplain, first to the Bishop of Exeter,and afterwards to the Lord Chancellor Hide Earl ofClarendon, which latter appointment led to many ofhis future preferments. In May, 1673, he was madeprincipal of Alban Hall in Oxford by the appointmentof the Duke of Ormondee, then chancellor ofthat university. As a person of accomplished learningand prudence, he was unanimously chosen toNARCISSUS MARSH. 2Q1preach the anniversary sermon on the 5th of November,1667, and the act sermon in 1678, in whichlatter year he was nominated to the provostship ofthe College of Dublin, and thence was advanced tothe bishopric of Ferns in 1682. In 1689, while hepresided over that see, he was attainted in KingJames s parliament, but in the following year wastranslated by King William to Cashel, where hepreached his primary visitation sermon in the churchof St. John, on the 27th of July, 1692. In this discoursehe impressed upon his clergy, that "theirsermons be plain and practical, suited to the capacitiesand exigencies of their hearers, treating chieflyof the most substantial and necessary truths in religion,which it behoved every man to know in order to hissalvation, especially concerning the fall of man, the officesof Christ, and the nature of the covenant of grace ;and pressing them home with practical inferences andobservations, that may be so many rules for the parishionersto walk by ; not amusing them with toosublime and speculative matters, such as are the doctrineof the Trinity, of God s decrees, of the mysteriesof the incarnation, and the like, farther than justto confirm the people in a belief of the truth of thesethings, when they come so in your way, that they cannotwell be passed over without saying something tothem ; but not at all to attempt explaining how theyare so, which cannot be done. Sermons to the peopleshould not treat of too sublime and speculativematters ; nor yet, should they treat of plain and familiarmatters after too sublime and speculative a292 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.a manner, as in scholastic terms running out intoneedless controversies, overlapping your discourseswith Latin and Greek, and the like, unless wherethere may be a necessity of it for explication or illustration,and there are some hearers capable of understandingit." He further admonished them concerningtheir funeral sermons, "that they should takecare not to be over lavish in their praises of the dead,lest others might thereby think themselves secure infollowing their examples." In reference to visitingthe sick, he adds, " You are to resort to the sickwithout expecting till you are sent for ; indeed, besidesthe necessity of doing so in that extreme exigencefor the direction of a parting soul in the rightway to heaven, how incongruous is it that the sickpersons should put you in mind of your duty,whereas you ought to put them in mind of theirs.The very Popish priests do shame us in this particular,and shall they be so warm and zealous inabad cause, and we be cold and negligent in a goodone ? God forbid ; let it never be once more namedamong us ; nor yet any just occasion hereafter begiven for men to make reflections thereupon, asthey are too apt to do whenever the least occasionthereunto is administered. I shall only add hereto,that you should be very cautious how you behaveyourselves towards men on their death-beds, that youneither run them into presumption nor despair, thatyou do not send some to hell with false hopes, andlet others go to heaven without any ; that you do notgive absolution upon slight repentance, nor deny itNARCISSUS MAUSil. 2Q3where the repentance is hearty and sincere, butwithout informing them how rare it is to find deathbedrepentance to be indeed sincere."In May, 1694, he was further promoted to this archbishopric,and in his visitation sermon reiterated themost of what he had pronounced at Cashcl, furtherexhorting the clergy of the province to perform divineservice frequently in the church, " to give notice onevery Sunday of what fast-days and holy-days are to bein the next week, according as the Rubric doth require,and to observe them themselves together with theirparishioners." " That the holy communion of thebody and blood of Christ be frequently administered."That the children in the respective parishes beprepared for confirmation, which is to be done bywell instructing them in the catechism ; and that theyand all other parishioners be instructed in the natureand benefit of confirmation." He further exhortedthem to reconcile their neighbours to attend to andprovide for the wants of the poor ; to keep registriesof marriages, christening, and burials ; to compileterriers of the glebes and church possessions, c. c.In 16 ( J5 he had a grant to him and his successorsfor ever of the castle, town, and lands of Seaton,Newtown, &c., in the barony of Nethercross, andcounty of Dublin, previously the property of theRussell family. In the same year the acts of 28 Hen.VIII. c. 15, for the establishing of parochial schools,and 12 Elis. c. 1, for maintaining diocesan freeschools, were ordered to be enforced. In 1697^when it was sought to exclude Roman Catholics from294 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.parliament by a bill entitled, " An act for the bettersecurity of his majesty s person and government,"but its provisions were considered so unjust andoppressive by the lords, that they negatived it by aconsiderable majority, this prelate was one of thefourteen peers who entered a protest, that certainlyis not a record of their Christian charity. The documentis given in full in the " The Lords Journals,"vol. i. p. 664. In 1698 the bishop of Coventry andLitchfield wrote to Archbishop Marsh respectingthe peculiar of Penkridge in Staffordshire," themanor and advowson of which had been, as beforementioned, granted to Henry de Loundres, and enjoyedby his successors. The Bishop of Coventry onthis occasion represented, that it had not been visitedby any of the archbishops of Dublin since 1660, andhe therefore prayed the permission of his grace tomake a visitation of it in his, the archbishop s, name,which request was accordingly complied with ; andthe usual commission passed the consistorial seal, empoweringthe bishop of Coventry and Litchfield tovisit for his Grace, " ejus peculiar jurisdictionde Penkridge."Doctor Marsh was ultimately translated to theprimatial see by the queen s letter, dated at St.James s, 26th of January, 1702-3, and by patent ofthe 18th of the ensuing month. While he governedthe Church of Dublin, he built a noble library nearthe palace of St. Sepulchre s, which he enlarged afterhis translation to Armagh, and filled with a choicecollection of books, having for that purpose boughtNARCISSUS MARSH. 2 ( J5the library of Doctor Edward Stillingfleet, formerlyBishop of Worcester, to which he added his owncollection, making a total of about 10,000 volumes;and, to render it more useful to the public, he plentifullyendowed a librarian and sub-librarian to attendit,at certain prescribed hours. It is estimated, thatbesides the endowment, which amounted to 250 perannum, charged on certain lands in the county ofMeath, he expended more than 4000 in the buildingsand books, and, to make every tiling secure toperpetuity, he obtained an act of parliament (6 Annec. 19,) for the settling and preserving it. Amongstother clauses, this statute declares the premises foreverdischarged of and from all manner of taxesalready imposed, or thereafter to be imposed by actof parliament, unless the same shall thereon be chargedexpressly, and by name. It is somewhat singular,that four bishops protested against this bill beingpassed into a law, but the reasons assigned were afterwardson motion withdrawn. In 1745 Marsh s libraryreceived a considerable and most valuable collectionof books and manuscripts, by the bequest ofDoctor Sterne, Bishop of Clogher. " I am undera necessity," says Harris, " of acknowledging from along experience, that this is the only useful libraryin the kingdom, being open to all strangers, and atall seasonable times ;" nor have the facilities for consultingboth its books and manuscripts been lessenedsince Harris s time, they were never more liberallyafforded than at the present day ; but the miserablepittance of 10 per annum, allotted for its yearly296 Archbishops OF DUBLIN.refreshment, is not sufficient to keep the books inorder. This prelate also endowed an alms-house atDrogheda, for the reception of twelve widows of decayedclergymen, to each of whom he allotted alodging, and 20 per annum for a maintenance, prescribing,that the widows, claiming to be entitledto such provision, should be the widows of thosewho had served cure in the diocese of Armagh ; or,if there should not be enough of that class to enjoythe charity, then the widows of such as had servedcure in the diocese of Meath ; and, for want of asufficient number of these, then the widows of theprovince of Armagh at large. And he provided,that if in such places widows enough were not foundfor the fund, then the same was to be applied forapprenticing or educating the children of clergymen ;and he allotted, out of the general fund, 40 perannum to the dean and chapter of Armagh, to beexpended in the support of that church. He alsorepaired many decayed churches within his dioceseat his own expense, bought in several impropriations,and restored them to the Church, and even extendedhis benevolent intentions to the encouragement of thepropagation of the gospel in the Indies. In short,the amount of the money he gave in acts of charity,was calculated to have been not less than 20,000.Towards the close of his life, he was during someyears, in consequence of age and sickness, unable toattend much to business, yet, as Archbishop Kingobserved in his funeral sermon, " he had the felicity,as well as prudence, to put his concerns, both spiritualNARCISSUS MARSH. 2<J7and temporal, into such good hands, that there wasno defect in the management of either, his diocesebeing in very good order, and a great increase addedto his fortune." He never married, and having diedin November 1713, in the seventy-sixth year of hisage, was buried on the sixth of that month, in thechurchyard of St. Patrick s, adjoining to his library,where there was formerly a stately monument ofwhite marble erected to his memory, with a lengthenedinscription, which Harris has preserved. Asthe monument, however, was suffering considerablyfrom the weather, it was removed into the cathedral,where it has been placed at the south side of thewest aisle ; while a mural plate in the churchyarddesignates the spot where his mortal remains weredeposited. But his character is his best memorial.He was a divine of extraordinary learning and piety.He had applied himself to the study of mathematics andnatural philosophy ; was deeply versed in the orientaltongues ; and withal, eminently skilled in both vocaland instrumental music ; comprehending the theoryand principles of harmony scientifically, and displayingas a practitioner considerable taste and execution.Many valuable works in Golius s collection of orientalmanuscripts were purchased by him, and presentedto the Bodleian Library. Besides his " InstitutionsLogical," usually called the Provost s Logic,which he published, while he presided over TrinityCollege, for the use of its students, he edited Philipde Tried s " Manuductio ad Logical," to which headded the original Greek text, and some notes onGassendi s tract, De Demonstration " printed at298 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.Oxford in 1678. He wrote also an Essay on Sounds,with Proposals for the Improvement of Acoustics,which was presented to the Royal Society in 1683,and printed in the Philosophical Transactions, No.156, and on which Guido Grandi, a philosopher ofCremona, has largely commented in his " DisquisitionGeometrical." He likewise published a Charge tothe Clergy of the Diocese of Dublin. Though zealouslyattached to the Church of England, and decidedlyhostile to that of Rome, this prelate displayeda spirit of liberality towards dissenters. Mr. JamesFleming, Presbyterian Minister of Lurgan, had beendeputed in the year 1708 by the presbytery of Armaghto preach in Drogheda, where he experiencedsome persecution, both from the mayor of the town,and from Dean Cox. His successor, Mr. WilliamBeggars, was imprisoned by these intolerant gentlemen,and confined for six weeks, Doctor Marsh sname and alleged certificate being used as authorityfor these harsh proceedings ; but the prelate, on hearingof the circumstance, resented the conduct of thedean and the mayor exceedingly, and declared " thatsuch severity against his dissenting brethren, wasboth against his principles and his inclination"*WILLIAM KING.[Succ. 1702. Ob. 1729.]William King, Doctor of Divinity, was born atAntrim on the first of May, 1650, and was descendedPresbyterian Loyalty, p. 512, &c.WILLIAM KING. 299from an ancient family of the house of Barras, in thenorth of Scotland, whence his father, James King,removed in the reign of King Charles the First, toavoid engaging in the solemn league and covenantat that time imposed under a species of excommunication,and he thereupon settled in the north of Ireland,where this his son was born, whom he lived tosee promoted to the bishopric of Derry. In 1662the young William was sent to a Latin school atDungannon, and on the 7th of April, 1666, was admitteda sizer in Trinity College, Dublin. Therehe remarkably distinguished himself, and obtained ascholarship and native s place. In February, 1670,he took the degree of bachelor of arts, in 1675 that ofmaster, and in this latter year received deacon s ordersfrom the hands of Doctor Robert Mossom, Bishop ofDerry. From the time of his admission into theCollege he contracted an intimate acquaintance withthe famous Mr. Henry Dwell, by whom he was instructedin logic and history ; but, although they everafterwards kept up a familiar and close correspondence,King s letters shew how much he differedfrom that gentleman in many points of divinity, andwhat pains he took to convince him of the evil tendencyof some of his whimsical speculations.Upon a week s warning, at the provost s command,he offered himself a candidate for a vacantfellowship in Trinity College, in which, though hedid not succeed, being the junior of all, yet he acquittedhimself with so much credit to his character,as strongly recommended him to the favour of John300 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.Parker, Archbishop of Tuam, who, in 1674, ordainedhim a priest, in 1675 admitted him into his family inquality of chaplain, in 1676 collated him to the prebendand vicarage of Kilmainmore, the rectory andvicarage of Kilmainbeg, the vicarages of Cong, Ross,Mortgage, Killmolara, and Ballincalla, all in the dioceseof Tuam, and county of Mayo. In October,1676, he was promoted by the same patron to theprovostship of the cathedral church of that diocese,and to the rectories and vicarages of Killareran, Tempalias Knockmoy, Kilkerin, Ballymakelly,Aghast, and the vicarage of Annaghdown, in thecounty of Galway. While he was chaplain in the familyof Archbishop Parker, he applied himself closely tothe acquisition of all useful learning, an inclinationwhich his patron sedulously encouraged, having conceiveda high opinion of his superior talents andexcellent qualifications. His Grace of Tuam havingbeen translated in 1678 to the see of Dublin, as beforementioned, collated Mr. King on the 27th ofOctober, 1679? to the chancellorship of St. Patrick s,to which the parish of St. Jedburgh s is annexed,where he employed himself with much diligence inkeeping his flock in the doctrine of his Church.He was involved, however, at this time in a contestwith Dean Worth, he denying that dignitary s rightof visiting independently of the chapter. King was,however, obliged to submit, to acknowledge his temerityin protesting against or refusing to appear at thedean s visitation, and to promise obedience in future.In 1686 he was engaged in a more serious con-williamKING. 301traverse with Peter Manby, Dean of Derry, who hadbecome a Roman Catholic, and published " The Considerationswhich obliged him to embrace the Catholicreligion." King s reply to this pamphlet wasentitled An Answer to the Considerations whichobliged Peter Manby, late Dean of Londonderry,(as he pretends) to embrace what he calls the Catholicreligion To this, there came forth a rejoinder, entitled" A reformed Catechism in two dialogues conearning the English Reformation, collected for themost part word for word, out of Doctor Burnet, JohnFox, and other Protestant historians, for the informationof the people, in reply to Mr. William King sAnswer to Dean Manby s Considerations, &c., by PeterManby, Dean of Londonderry." King s reply appearedunder the name of " A Vindication of theAnswer to the Considerations, &c., being an answer tothe first dialogue already printed of the ReformedCatechism," whereupon, the Dean published " A Letterto a Friend, shewing the vanity of his opinion, thatevery man s sense and reason are to guide him inmatters of faith which produced King s last word,A Vindication of the Christian Religion and Reformation,against the attempts of a late Letter, pretendingto shew that all religions have a like plea, and thatthere can be no such sins as heresy and schism, if everyman s sense and reason are to guide him in matters offaith." In 1688, King was constituted president ofthe chapter of St. Patrick s on the death of DeanWorth, and, in the January following, was elected302 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.dean by the chapter, " undoubted patrons of thatdignity."On the accession of James the Second, after mostof the Protestant clergy had fled, he continued toreside in Dublin, and considerably promoted the reductionof the adherents of James the Second by hisinfluence. When he saw the attempt made to abrogatethe Act of Settlement, without reflecting that a moreatrocious, unjust, and ungrateful affirmance of theusurpation of adventurers never passed any legislativeassembly* he conceived himself impelled by hisreligious principles, to persuade the Protestants, asmost affected thereby, to embrace the deliveranceoffered to them by the Prince of Orange, to acknowledgehim their king, and submit to his government,and undoubtedly he was singularly instrumental in promotingthe course of the revolution in this kingdom.In 1689 he took his degree of doctor of divinity,and in the July of that year was, together with DoctorFoy, and many other Protestant clergymen, imprisonedin the Castle, immediately upon which, heappointed Mr. Henry Price his sub-dean, "and let mebeseech you," he says in his letter of nomination,do what you can to keep the Church in order ;and I desire the assistance of your prayers, &c."Leslie attributes this, his imprisonment, to hishaving corresponded and given intelligence to theWilliams party, and particularly to Marshal Schom-berg, and his having kept up a constant correspondencewith Tolet and others in London. During hisconfinement he compiled the well-known work, "TheWILLIAM KING. 303State of the Protestants of Ireland under KingJames s Government." He was, however, shortlyenlarged through the influence of Herbert, thenappointed by King James lord high chancellor ofEngland, who, while warmly attached to that monarchs interest, was a zealous Protestant ; and on alloccasions, the chief patron and protector of the distressedpeople of his own communion.As soon as he was released, Doctor King appliedhimself to the care of the diocese of Dublin, as beforementioned, which Archbishop Francis Marsh haddeserted. In 1690 he was again confined, but thevictory of the Boyne opened his prison door, andpointed the avenue for his spiritual promotion. In afew days after that engagement, when King Williamentered Dublin in triumph, Dean King preached thethanksgiving sermon in St. Patrick s ; and, on the9th of the following January, he was promoted to thebishopric of Deny, and received consecration atChrist Church, Dublin, from the hands of ArchbishopFrancis Marsh, assisted by the Bishops ofMeath, Leighlin and Ferns, Kildare and Killaloe ; theking s metropolitan, Michael, Archbishop of Armagh,being then sick and unable to discharge the duty.After his consecration he immediately repaired to hisdiocese, which he found in all the wretchedness andmisery induced by civil war ; the villages and plantationsall destroyed ; the churches burned or dilapidated; the clergy withdrawn ; and the parishes notableto supply a resident ministry, occasioned by thepoverty of the people, and the want of tillage and304 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.cattle. The bishop in a short time obliged theclergy to reside, or resign, or appoint and maintainsufficient curates ; and out of his own revenues hesupported many vicars, until the improvements ofthe respective parishes brought them in a sufficientand decent maintenance. When he was settled inhis bishopric, he zealously laboured, and even publisheda treatise, to persuade the dissenting Protestantsof his diocese, who were much increased by coloniesfrom Scotland, to conform to the Established Church ;and this work of his ministry was attended with considerablesuccess. In 1692 he took a journey toEngland, to confer with the London Society, whowere proprietors of a good part of the county ofDerry, and between whom and his predecessor,Bishop Hopkins, there had been warm disputes aboutsome lands and the fishery of the Bank. BishopKing proposed very equitable terms for an accommodation,but they were rejected, and a law suitcommenced, which, in its consequence, gave rise to adecree in the House of Lords of England, that thebishop s appeal to the House of Lords of Irelandfrom the decree or orders of the chancery there, wascoram non judice, and that all the proceedingstherein were null and void, and that the Chancery ofIreland ought to proceed in the said cause as if nosuch appeal had been made to the House of Lordsthere. His acts, however, in immediate referenceto the see of Derry, are not properly referable to thiswork.In 1694 he published "A discourse concerningWILLIAM KING. 3Q5the inventions of men in the worship of God," whichhaving been answered by Mr. Joseph Boysee, a dissentingminister, and by Robert Crashed, minister ofthe gospel in Derry, induced the bishop to write two"Admonitions to the Dissenting Inhabitants of thediocese of Derry," after which Mr. Boysee wrote aVindication of his Remarks. In 1702, on the promotionof Doctor Narcissus Marsh to the primacy,Bishop King was elected, by both chapters of Dublin,administrator of the spiritualities of that see, to thearchbishopric of which he was fully translated onthe llth of March in the same year. He has beenaccused of having sought the passing of the patentof this promotion in an unusual form, with a clausethat he should be enthroned either by the dean ofChrist Church or St. Patrick s, which, it was alleged,was never in any patent before, and he actually heldvisitations in St. Patrick s without enthronization,while he wholly declined coming to prayers to ChristChurch until lie should be enthroned there, andsummoned the prebendaries of Christ Church to hisvisitations in St. Patrick s, which three of the ablestlawyers of the time declared to be illegal. Theseand other matters of difference between him and hisclergy cannot be now of interest, but may be foundvery fully detailed in the Church history of the period.On taking possession of this see he appliedhimself with his usual assiduity to the founding ofnew churches in several parts of the diocese, and bythe application of the impropriate forfeited tithes,pursuant to the English act 1 1 Will. III., by his own306 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.contribution and the donations of others, he procurednineteen new churches to be erected in places, whereno divine service had been performed since the periodof the Reformation, causing also seven others to berebuilt and fourteen to be repaired. To supplythese new churches with pastors, as the contiguousparishes became vacant, which consisted often ofmany unions, he divided them, and there settled aresident clergy, and, observing that most of theseparishes were not accommodated with glebe land forthe comfortable support of the incumbents, he apportionedto each, twenty acres out of the see land,pursuant to the enabling statute, 2 Anne, sess. 1,c. 10, as glebes at a very moderate reserved rent, sothat most of the vicarages of his diocese were suppliedwith convenient land. When he likewise foundthat the income of the resident clergymen wasscarcely sufficient for a decent maintenance, in consequenceof the many divisions made of unions whichformerly made these parishes very considerable, toremedy this in some measure, he annexed the prebendsof St. Patrick s, as they became vacant, to thevicarages which were before separate and in distinctpersons. He likewise, as appears from a letter ofhis in 1727j caused eleven alms houses to be built onglebes, several of which were his own gift. DeanSwift mentions a peculiar mode by which he encouragedhis clergy to residence; " when a lease had runout seven years or more, he stipulated with the tenantto resign twenty or thirty acres to the minister of theparish where it lay convenient, without lessening hisWILLIAM KING. 307former rent and with no great abatement in the fine,and this he did in the parts near Dublin, where landisat the highest rates, leaving a small chiefly for theminister to pay, hardly a sixth part of the value."In this, the first year of his promotion, he publishedhis well known work " de Origine Mali," which Mr.Bayle and Mr. Leibnitz examined and censured. Heendeavours therein to shew how all the kinds of evil,with which the world abounds, are consistent with thegoodness of God, and maybe accounted for without thesupposition of an evil principle ; Doctor Whateley,the present Archbishop, has published a comment onit, in which he styles King s work " a presumptuousspeculation." In 1703, Archbishop King having previouslypurchased in his natural capacity, the landsof Seaton, Newtown, &c., 524A. which had belongedto this see, relinquished any personal benefittherefrom, and caused patents thereof to be passedto himself and his successors, Archbishops of Dublin, inaugmentation of their revenues ; which patents wereconfirmed by an English act of the fifth year of thereign of Been Anne. In the Irish parliament of 1703were passed, the act for quieting the Protestant Hierarchyin their possessions, discharged to a certain extent ofancient incumbrances ; the act authorizing the exchangeof glebes, with approbation of the bishop andpatron ; and the act for naturalizing Protestantstrangers. In the same session, when the questionwas put to take into consideration the heads of a billsent up by the commons, making it high treason, bywordor writing to impeach the succession of thex2308 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.crown as then limited, and when said question wasnegatived, Archbishop King was one of the threepeers who protested against that negative. He wasalso one of the three who protested against deferringthe consideration of the Earl of Heath s memorablepetition, complaining of the appellate jurisdictionaffected to be exercised by the House of Lords ofEngland over that of Ireland. But above all, it redoundsto the high-minded and independent spirit ofthis prelate, that when at the same time the Britishsenate had enacted, that the kingdom of Ireland wassubordinate to that of Great Britain, and might bebound by laws made in England without its concurrence,this prelate was one of those who supportedthe spirited assertion of Irish independence that appearson the Lords Journals of that period. A clericalconvocation was also held in this year, principallyby Archbishop King s instrumentality.In 1704 he preached the thanksgiving sermon inChrist Church, before the lords justices, for the victoryof Hochstet, having prevented the dean of thatcathedral from so doing; and in 1705 he preachedbefore the queen in St. James s chapel. About theryear 1706 he purchased a large portion of impropriatetithes in the county of Kildare, which he vestedin trustees for augmenting small cures in his diocese,upon the especial condition, that the incumbentsshould constantly reside, and that the income of theirparishes should not exceed 100 per annum ; he alsobought up 49 per annum,, part of the estate of SirJohn Eccles, and settled it for the support of aWILLIAM KING. 309lecturer in St. George s chapel, Dublin ; he likewisepurchased the lay rectories of Cruagh in the countyof Dublin, and those of Ballintemple tint Newcastlein the county of Wicklow, and collated respective incumbentsthereto, divesting himself of the profits ofsaid benefices, and retaining only the patronage. Inthe same year he preached before the lord mayorand magistrates of Dublin, on the mischief of delayingsentence against an evil work, taking for histext Ecdcs. c. viii. v. 11. This discourse has beenprinted.In 1708 this prelate was of the privy council thatissued a proclamation to prohibit the exportation ofcorn, grain, and meal from Ireland, on account ofthe high prices at which they were sold, occasioned,partly by the badness of the previous harvest, but yetmore by several merchants exporting such quantitiesabroad, " that the poorer sort of inhabitants of thiskingdom would be in danger of perishing, unlesssome speedy stop be put to the exportation thereof."In the same year he and the other Irish prelates employedDean Swift, who had been an active memberof the Irish convocation in the preceding year, to solicitthe remission of the first fruits. He made hisapplication to Lord Godolphin, with the encouragementof Lord Sunderland, Lord Somers, Mr. Southwell, and other leading members among the ministry,but it was ineffectual ; as the grant of the first fruitsand tenths in England had not been attended with theexpected consequences, of reconciling the clergy tothe ministers by whom the favour was bestowed, the310 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.lord treasurer showed little inclination to repeat theexperiment ; yet he intimated to Swift, that the grantmight be obtained on condition the Irish clergy weredisposed to make such acknowledgments " as theyought ;" or, as he reluctantly explained the phrase,better acknowledgments than had been made by thechurchmen of England. Swift s inference was, thatGodolphin suspected the clergy to be Tories, in thethen received sense, that is, hostile to the Revolutionand settlement of the crown ; a suspicion whichrendered his commission desperate ; and, though hewas afterwards raised to better hopes by Lord Pembroke,yet his first opinion proved just, and nothingwas done in the matter until the administration ofLord Harley. In 1 709 Archbishop King preacheda sermon before Lord Wharton and the House ofLords in Christ Church, on divine predestinationand foreknowledge as consistent with the freedom ofman s will, taking as his text Rom. viii. v. 29, 30.Doctor John Edward commented on this effusion, astending to lessen the divine attributes and perfections; but Doctor Cohesion has highly commendedit, in the notes to his " Inquiry concerning Predestination;" and the present Archbishop of Dublin,Doctor Whateley, in a re-print of the sermon withcomments, says, " It is calculated to afford usefulhints even to the most learned divine, to furnish theyounger student with principles, which will form thebest basis on which to build his whole system of theology; and to supply even the unlearned reader withthe most valuable instruction, suited to a moderate ca-williamKING. 31 Jpacify, on the most important points." In the parliamentof the same year, Archbishop King was one ofthe seven prelates, who, much to their credit, protestedagainst the bill for the further growth of Popery,as will be more particularly mentioned in thememoir of the Roman Catholic Archbishop, DoctorByrne.In 1711, Doctor King, in a letter to Dean Swift,makes the following interesting allusion to the stateof the times : " The preliminaries of our parliamentare now over; that is to say, addresses, &c.; and Ifind the usual funds will be granted, I think, unanimouslyfor two years from Christmas next, whichis all the Duke of Ormondee desires ; I do not seemuch more will be done; you will observe severalreflections are in the addresses on the late managementhere, in which the Earl of Anglesey and I differed.If we could impeach, as you can in GreatBritain, and bring the malefactors to account, Ishould be for it with all my endeavour ; but to showour ill-will, when we can do no more, seems to be nogood policy in a dependent people, and that can haveno other effect than to provoke revenge, without theprospect of redress, of which we have too fatal instances.I reckon that every chief governor, who issent here, comes with a design to serve first those whosent him, and that our good only must be so far consideredas it is subservient to the main design. Theonly difference between governors as to us is to have agood-natured man, that has some interest in ourprosperity, and will not oppress us unnecessarily, and312 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.such is his Grace ; but I doubt, whether even thatwill not be an objection against him on your side ofthe water; for I have found that those governors, thatgained most on the liberties of the kingdom, arereckoned the best, and therefore it concerns us to beon our guard against all governors, and to provoke aslittle as we can. For he that cannot revenge himselfacts the wise part, when he dissembles and passesover injuries. In my opinion, the best that has happenedto us is, that the parliament grants the fundsfor two years, for by these means we shall have onesummer to ourselves to do our Church and countrybusiness. I have not been able to visit my dioceseecclesiastic, as I used to do, the last three years forwant of such a recess Our letter is come overfor wherewithal of the twentieth parts, and granting thefirst fruits for buying impropriations and purchasingglebes, which will be a great ease to the clergy, and abenefit to the Church. We want glebes more than theimpropriations, and I am for buying them first wherewanting, for without them residence is impossible ;and besides, I look upon it as a security to tithes,that the laity have a share in them ; and, therefore, Iam not for purchasing them but where they are absolutelynecessary. We shall, I believe, have someconsiderations of methods to convert the natives ; butI do not find that it is desired by all that they shouldbe converted. There is a party among us that havelittle sense of religion, and heartily hate the Church ;these would have the natives made Protestants, butsuch as themselves are deadly afraid they shouldWILLIAM KING. 313come into the Church, because, say they, this wouldstrengthen the Church too much. Others wouldhave them come in, but can t approve of the methodsproposed, which are to preach to them in their ownlanguage, and to have the service in Irish, as our owncanons require ; so that between them I am afraidthat little will be done."In 1713 the House of Lords moved an addressto the Queen in favour of the Lord Chancellor, SirConstantine Phipps, wherein they expressed themselvesas "obliged in justice to that excellent ministerin all humility to represent unto your Majesty, thatwe do not find but that in the several eminent stations,in which he hath served your Majesty since hiscoming into this country, he hath acquitted himselfwith honour and integrity, as becomes a discerningand vigilant governor, an equal administrator of justice,a true lover of the Church as by law established,and a zealous assertor of the prerogative, in oppositionto a factious spirit which hath too much prevailedin this nation"* When this address was voted, ArchbishopKing, who was throughout opposed to the Chancellors liberal politics, headed the list of seven peerswho protested against it. In July of the same year heobtained judgment from the English House of Lordsin a cause long pending between him and Doctor TheophilusHarrison, then prebendary of the church ofSt. John in Dublin, and in the November followinghe preached the funeral sermon of Archbishop Marsh,Lords Journals, vol. ii. p. 438.314 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.taking for his text Psalm 112, v. 6. In May, 1714,he, Sir Constantine Phipps, and others were of theprivy council, who issued the proclamation for preventingthe enlisting of recruits in aid of the Pretender,and for the discovery of such persons as hadtheretofore promoted such enlisting. On the accessionof George the First, the lords of the regencyof England, having removed the Primate and SirConstantine Phipps, then Lord Chancellor, from thegovernment of Ireland, appointed as Lords Justicesthe Earl of Kildare and this prelate, who soon afterwards,on " some profligate persons having offeredgreat indignities to the memory of King William theThird, by taking out and breaking the truncheon inhis statue erected in College-green," did by proclamationdeclare " all concerned in that barbarous fact guiltyof the greatest insolence, baseness, and ingratitude,and offered large rewards for their apprehension. *In 1715 the act was passed empowering the LordLieutenant and Council to unite or divide parishes,to appropriate benefices with cure to dignities withoutcure, and to direct the erection of new churches,the same statute prescribing the modes of presentationthereto, and of endowing or augmenting theendowments of vicarages. By this act also a tract ofland, called the surgery of Cloyne, which had beenannexed to the see of Dublin, was transferred to thatof Cloyne, charged, however, with a fee-farm rent of26 per annum to Archbishop King and his successorsfor ever. In this session was likewise passed anact, which this prelate had long laboured to obtain, con-williamKING. 315forming the grants made by Queen Anne of the firstfruitsand twentieth parts, and also allowing thosechargeable therewith four years for their payment.A letter of Doctor King to Dean Swift, from Susfolk-street, London, dated 22nd of November, 1716,evinces the amicable relations he wished to preservewith his clergy. " I am glad the business of St.Nicholas is over any way, my inclination was Mr.Wall, that I might have joined the vicarage of to the prebend of Mullaghiddart, whichwould have made a good provision for one man,served the cures better, and yielded more then to theincumbent, than it can do now when in differenthands ; but I could not compass it without usingmore power over my clergy than I am willing to exert.But as I am thankful to you for your condescensionin that affair, so I will expect that those with whomyou have complied should shew their sense of it, bya mutual return of the like compliance when thereshall be occasion ; such reciprocal kind offices arethe ground of mutual confidence and friendship, andthe fuel that keeps them alive, and I think nothingcan contribute more to our common ease and thepublic good, than maintaining these between you andme and with the clergy."About the commencement of the year 1717> thecelebrated Lord Wharton having come into thiscountry, and been honoured with a seat in the Houseof Lords by the general consent of the peers, althoughhe was then only eighteen years of age, one of hisearliest political displays was levelled against this ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.late, for some advice which it was alleged he had givento the late king ; and, such was the address of theyoung orator on this occasion, that he persuaded thehouse to commit the archbishop to prison in the Castleof Dublin, where he remained until the sameeccentric nobleman moved that his Grace might bebrought to the bar of the house, acknowledge his presumption,and ask pardon upon his knees ; termswith which the archbishop was actually forced tocomply. In the same year he was again, however,one of the Lords Justices. A letter of his in thefollowing year evinces, with what unwearied zeal helaboured to induce private assistance of pecuniaryaids for ecclesiastical purposes. The epistle alluded towas written by him in reply to one from Mr. SecretarySouthwell, wherein the latter had complained ofgouty ankles. The archbishop, half seriously, halfjocularly, tells him he wants money to build three orfour churches, and if he would throw away a propersum for that purpose, it might lighten the load of hisriches, which they allege is very ill for the gout, andapt to strain his ankles : " I am," he adds, " nowgoing into my forty-third gouty year, and, if I hadnot taken care to keep myself light that way, I hadcertainly been a cripple long ago. You see, then,your remedy ; pray try it : a little assignment of ayear s salary, though it may not cure your ankles, willcertainly ease a toe." And in a subsequent letter hesays more seriously and feelingly to the same person,Consider you have received out of Ireland at leastsixty thousand pounds since the Revolution, whichWILLIAM KING. 317is more that the tenth part of all the current coin ofIreland ; and sure there ought to be some footstepof charitable work done to a kingdom, out of whichyou have drained so vast sums." Sundry other lettersof this prelate, yet extant, are replete with abusesof the institutions of Ireland, and the beggary of thepeople by the mismanagement of its governors at thisperiod. In this latter year (1/18) Archbishop Kingheld a synod or visitation in St. Patrick s Church, atwhich, in order to the due execution of the act forthe union and division of parishes, it was directedthat the clergy of this diocese should return lists ofthe lowlands in their several parishes, and their respectivedistance from a church ; the names of theseveral patrons of their parishes ; what parishes ortithes were in lay hands, or appropriated to ecclesiasticalcorporations ; the amount of forfeited tithes,vicarial endowments, and curates stipends ; the extentof glebes, or what lands might be convenientlyobtained for such ; what unions or divisions might beeligible ; the state of the churches ; the comparativepopulation of conformists, dissenters, and papists inthe city of Dublin ; the yearly value of each parish,&c. &c.In 1719 the act was passed for the better maintenanceof curates, directing the ordinary to appointstipends to be paid to them by the rectors or vicars,and to enforce payment thereof by sequestration. Inthe same session Archbishop King was one of sixteenpeers, (eight being spiritual,) who protested againstthe act for exempting the Protestant dissenters of318 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.Ireland from certain penalties to which they werethen subject. He also protested against the billfor better securing the rights of advowson and presentationto ecclesiastical benefices. In the sameyear he published " A Discourse concerning the Consecrationof Churches, shewing what is meant by dedicatingthem, with the grounds of that office." Atthis period of his life. Dean Swift thus alludes tohim in his " Proposal for the universal Use of IrishManufacture, &c." : " I think it needless," he says,in reference to his project, "to exhort the clergy tofollow this good example, because in a little timethose among them, who are so unfortunate as to havehad their birth and education in this country, willthink themselves abundantly happy when they canafford Irish crape and an Alone hat ; and as to theothers, I shall not presume to direct them. I have,indeed, seen the present archbishop of Dublin cladfrom head to foot in our own manufacture ; and yet,under the rose be it spoken, his Grace deserves asgood a gown as if he had not been born among us."Doctor King was vehemently opposed to theSouth Sea scheme, in reference to which, he wrote toArchbishop Wake in February, 1720 : " As to yourSouth Sea affair, I told the fate of it last April, whenit was at three hundred for one hundred, and theevent has in every particular answered my prediction,which I set down in a few queries, which I shewedto my friends, but would not suffer them to be printed,because I understood that whoever said anythingagainst the South Sea was looked on as disaffected toWILLIAM KING. 31Qthe government and ministry, which is an accusationI would by no means lie under. I find both housesare pretty smart on the directors, but I hear nothingsaid concerning those whose office it was to preventthe ruin of the nation. If they did see that, and sufferedit when it was so easy to prevent it, it is nohard matter to determine what they deserve : if theydid not see it, they were the only blind set of men inthe kingdom, and for the future ought never to betrusted in any public business, and beside that, chastisedfor meddling in the matters of which they wereabsolutely incapable, for surely such ought not to gounpunished ; but it is now no new thing to hanglittle rogues and let the great escape"* In anotherletter, dated in the following month, he draws a melancholypicture of the ruin induced in Dublin, bythe bursting of that bubble, and the prevalence ofabsenteeism.In 1721 this prelate granted to the ReverendThomas Peterson forty acres of land adjoining theriver Annamoe, in the county of Wicklow, an endowmentwhich was confirmed by Dean Swift ; and aboutthe same time he gave 500 to the Blue Coat Hospitalin Dublin. In that year he was, for the fourthtime, constituted one of the Lords Justices, a trustwhich he fulfilled at all times with zealous attachmentto the house of Hanover and the succession of thecrown in that family. Yet it is not a little remarkable,that on the occasion of the parliament of thatAutogr. in Brit. Museum.320 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.year, when the lords voted an address to his majesty,begging leave to return unfeigned thanks for hisgracious acceptance of their expressions of duty andloyalty in former sessions of parliament," ArchbishopKing formally protested against these words,because, as he signifies, " I have always been againstaddresses of mere compliments between the crownand the parliament, believing they may be of illconsequence." It was at this session the statute wasenacted, authorizing the increasing of glebes, with aspecial clause, empowering this prelate by deed enrolledto grant lands, whereof he was seised in hisown right to resident curates and their successors.An act was likewise passed to encourage the residenceof the clergy having cure of souls, and toenable bishops to grant two acres for Protestantschools in the several parishes. In 1723 the act2 Geo. I. c. 14, for the real union and division ofparishes, was further confirmed by parliament ; andthe act 2 Geo. I. c. 15, relative to the payment ofthe first fruits, was amended.In April, 1724, Doctor King obtained a finaljudgment from the English House of Lords, againstthe Dean of Christ Church, who had successivelyappealed from the Court of Common Pleas to that ofKing s Bench in Ireland, and thence to the Courtof King s Bench in England. In July of the sameyear, Doctor Armature Chill, writing to theHonourable Edward Southwell, while he announcesthe death of the primate, intimates " the wishes ofthe kingdom generally, that the Archbishop of Dub-williamKING. 321lin should succeed him." Doctor Boulter, however,was preferred to the primacy, which may account forthe " open enmity, never to be reconciled," that thesame Doctor Chill in the following year states asexisting between these prelates. The reason assignedfor not giving the preferment to DoctorKing yet more offended him, as that he was too faradvanced in years to be removed, and the only opportunitythat offered for manifesting his resentment,he embraced, when, receiving the primate athis own house and in his dining parlour, he remainedin his chair without rising, and emphaticallyapologized in the words, " my Lord, I am certain yourGrace will forgive me, because you know I am tooold to rise."A letter of this prelate in the same year (1?24)to the before mentioned Mr. Southwell, as spiritedlyrebukes that personage in reference to the coinage ofWood s halfpence. " The people here are of opinionthat you owed so much to your country, as to haveventured a little of your interest to have put thismatter in a fair light, but they are persuaded thatthe design was all by artifice and cunning to passthese halfpence upon us, and they take it very ill thatyou have made yourself a tool in it." Swift, who insome other matters was much opposed to his Grace,warmly commends his opposition to Wood s coinageand his general character, particularly in the verses :I sing not of the Draper s praise, nor yet of William Wood,But I sing of a famous Lord, who seeks his Country s good ;Y322 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.Lord William s Grace of Dublin town tis he that first appears,Whose wisdom and whose piety do far exceed his years ;In every council and debate he stands for what is right,And still the truth he will maintain what er he loses by t ;And though some think him in the wrong, yet still there comes aseason,When every one turns round about and owns his Grace had reason ;His firmness to the public good, as one that knows it swore,Has lost his Grace for ten years past ten thousand pounds andmore ;Then come the poor and strip him so, they leave him not a cross,For he regards ten thousand pounds no more than Woods s dross.&c. &c. &c.About the same time Doctor King elicited similarapprobation from the dean, by directing the clergyand churchwardens of the city of Dublin to appointbadges of brass, copper, or pewter to be worn by thepoor of the several parishes, the badges to be markedwith the initial letters of the name of each church,and numbered 1, 2, 3, &c,, to be well sewed andfastened on the right or left shoulder of the outwardgarment of each of the said poor ; and he directedthat none should go out of their own parish to beg,whereof the beadles were to take care. The project,however, proved ineffectual by the fraud, perverseness,or pride of its objects, who refused to receivethe badges, or secreted them about their persons. In1 725 the acts were passed for the more effectual encouragementof free schools and the improvement ofChurch lands.In and previous to the year 1726, the jealousy,which existed between Doctor King and the PrimateWILLIAM KING. 323of Armagh, broke out in a controversy, whereinBoulter claimed an exclusive power, by grant fromthe crown to his see, of licensing marriages at canonicalhours and places. The difference was mostangrily conducted on the part of the Primate, who,as the leader of what was most unhappily termed theEnglish interest, was diametrically opposed in politicsto Doctor King. The declining health of the latterelicited a letter from his opponent, painfully illustratingthe state in which he regarded his brotherprelate. It is dated the 26th of January, 1726, andaddressed to the Duke of Newcastle. As his Graceof Dublin has been pretty much out of order, thoughI cannot hear for certain that he is in any great danger,several letters may go from hence representinghim as dying ; that such accounts may not occasionany hasty measures being taken, I must beg leave tosuggest, that the archbishopric is a place of very greatimportance, and a good agreement betwixt the primateand the archbishop is of great consequence tothe English interest here : I would therefore humblyentreat, that no steps may be taken about appointinghis successor upon any rumours of his death, till myrepresentations on that subject are considered, whichI shall not fail to be speedy in sending, whenever itpleases God to remove his Grace"*In 1726 he granted to Robert Dougat, Vicar ofSt. Peter s, and to his successors for ever, a piece ofground adjoining the glebe of St. Kevin s, containingBoulter s Letters, vol. i. p. 102.Y 2324 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.SR, GP., at 2s. 6d. annual rent, the grant being meantas an augmentation ; and, about the same time, enjoinednot only the incumbents, but also the curatesof the parishes within his diocese, to preach four sermonsin each year on controversial subjects.* Onthe accession of George the Second in the followingyear, many changes were made in civil and militaryemployments, and more designed, when, severalgentlemen having been removed on suspicion of theirdisloyalty, his Grace, who knew that some of themwere well affected to the government, and their charactersmisrepresented to make room for the promotionof others, wrote to the Secretaries of State in theirfavour, asserting their fidelity to the king and capacityto serve him in their offices ; and his interposition hadin some instances the desired effect. At the sameperiod, when Primate Boulter instituted a subscriptionfor the relief of the Protestants of Lithuania,Archbishop King, however averse to "popery," yetsensible of the distress and poverty that surroundedhim in Ireland, forbade all collection for foreignerswithin his province. In this year an act was passed,authorizing the recovery of tithes of small value beforemagistrates ; another, encouraging the residenceof the clergy and the granting of glebes ; a third,enabling prelates and other ecclesiastical persons andcorporations, to grant their rights of patronage in smalllivings to such persons as would augment the same ;a fourth, for the better maintenance of curates ; andArchbishop Cradock s Primary Charge.WILLIAM KIN G. 325a fifth, for better securing the rights of advowsonsand regulating proceedings by quare impede. In1728, having previously considered that the mensaltithes of his see were of little value to the archbishops,as having been usually let out on leases,producing a total of only about 49 per annum, andthat yet, being rectorial, they would be of great momentto the vicars of the parishes where they lay ;he therefore so appropriated them, as to augmentthe following vicarages to the great advantage oftheir respective incumbents ; the vicarage of Inch andKilgorman, in the barony of Grey, county of Wexford; the vicarage of Arklow, with the tithes ofKilbride, Templemichael, and Kilmacow ; the vicarageof Bray, with the tithes of Connaught, Fassaroeand Bellman ; the vicarage of Derrylossory and Glen-clough,with the rectorial tithes of the same, &c ;while, in lieu thereof, he purchased for the see aboutthirteen acres of land, divided into closes and gardens,on the north side of Dolphin s Barns, worth atthat time 65 Ss. annually, and obtained an act ofcouncil to annex same to the see in perpetuity. Hefurther expended the sum of 3000 in repairing andadorning the episcopal palace at St. Sepulchre s,which was in a ruinous condition, and he also erecteda court house for its manor at his own charge, towhich he joined a prison for the confinement ofdebtors.In May, 1729> he died at the advanced age ofeighty years, in the palace which he had so re-edified,and was buried on the north side of the churchyard326 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.of Donnybrook, as he had directed in his life-time.By his will, bearing date the 6th of May, 1 726, hedevised to the Archbishop of Tuam, and the Bishopof Clogher, 400 towards purchasing glebes for suchone or more churches in this diocese, as should seemto them and his executor in most need thereof, and,having in his life-time given 500 to the College ofDublin, towards founding a divinity lectureship, forthe benefit of such bachelors of the said house aselected the sacred ministry, to the intent of betterqualifying them for holy orders, he devised 500more to his nephew the Reverend Robert Dougat,in trust to purchase a further maintenance and endowmentfor the said lectureship. He also left150 to the poor of the city of Dublin, and, havingpurchased the library of his predecessor in Deny,Doctor Hopkins, he bequeathed it to Doctor Nicholson,then Bishop of Deny and his successors, intrustfor the perpetual use of the gentlemen andclergy of that diocese.Harris thus gives his character : " He appears,in the tendency of his actions and endeavours, tohave had the advancement of religion, virtue andlearning entirely at heart, and may deservedly beenrolled amongst the greatest, the most universallyaccomplished and learned prelates of the age. Hiscapacity and spirit to govern the Church were visiblein his avowed enmity to pluralities and non-residence ;in his strict and regular visitations, annual, triennial,and parochial ; in his constant duty of confirmationand preaching ; and in the many excellent admonishKING. 327tons and charges he gave his clergy upon those occasions; in his pastoral care and diligence in admittingnone into the sacred ministry but persons well qualifiedfor their learning and good morals, who weregraduates regularly educated in the Universities ofEngland or Dublin, and who were before their ordinationspublicly examined in the necessary points ofdivinity by him, his archdeacon, and some of hischapter. His hospitality was suitable to the dignityof his station and character ; arid the whole course ofhis conversation innocent, cheerful, and improving,for he lived in the constant practice of every Christianvirtue and grace, that could adorn a public orprivate life." Swift characterizes him, in no less laudatoryterms, as having ever been " a loyal subjectto the queen, entirely for the succession in the Protestantline, and for ever excluding the Pretender ;and though a firm friend to the Church, yet with indulgencetowards Dissenters, as appears from hisconduct at Deny, where lie was settled for manyyears among the most virulent of the sect, yet, uponhis removal to Dublin, they parted from him withtears in their eyes, and universal acknowledgmentsof his wisdom and goodness. For the rest, it mustbe owned, he does not busy himself by entering deepinto any party, but rather spends his time in acts ofhospitality and charity, in building of churches, repairinghis palace ; in introducing and preferringthe worthiest persons he can find, without other regards; in short, in the practice of all virtues thatcan become a public or private life. This, and more,328 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.if possible, is due to so excellent a person, who maybejustly reckoned among the greatest and mostlearned prelates of this age." The latter eulogy isthe more creditable to both parties, as, notwithstandingall the esteem and respect those persons entertainedfor each other s qualifications, they were, nevertheless,embroiled in perpetual quarrels on points ofecclesiastical jurisdiction. A letter of the Dean tothe Archbishop, in May, 1727 ? in reference to thosedisputes, is peculiarly sturdy and ungracious :My Lord, I understand, by some letters just cometo my hands, that at your Grace s visitation of thedean and chapter of St. Patrick s, a proxy was insistedon from the dean ; the visitation adjourned, and arule entered that a proxy be exhibited within a month.If your Grace can find in any of your old recordsor of ours, that a proxy was ever demanded for adean of St. Patrick s, you will have some reason toinsist upon it ; but, as it is a thing wholly new andunheard of, let the consequences be what they will, Ishall never comply with it. I take my chapter to bemy proxy, if I want any ; it is only through themthat you visit me ; and my sub-dean is to answer forme.I am neither civilian nor canonist ; your Gracemay, probably, be both, with the addition of a dexterousdeputy. My proceeding shall be only upon amaxim, never to yield to an oppression to justifywhich no precedent can be produced.

This has somethingin it the more extraordinary, because, during someyears, when I was thought to have credit with thosein power, I employed it to the utmost for your servicewith great success, where it could be most useful,against many violent enemies you then had, howeverunjustly ; by which I got more ill will than by anyother action in my life : I mean from my friends ;"&c. &c. &c.Doctor King s literary productions have beenenumerated in the course of the memoir ; the chief ofthese, the State of the Protestants in Ireland, Burnetterms " a full and faithful account ;" and, in a letterto Sir Robert Southwell, reverting to its politicaltendency, describes it as " not only the best book thathad been written for the service of the government,but, without any figure, it is worth all the rest puttogether, and will do more than all our scribbling forsettling the minds of the nation." At this distanceof time and test of its experience, the impartial criticwill say, that the settling the minds of the nation wasas little the object as it was the result; the work perhaps,more than any other, contributed to envenomthe wounds which religious dissensions would notpermit to close. Mr. Charles Leslie, by whom itwas attacked, asserts that "there is not one singlefact he has inquired into, but he found it false in330 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.whole or in part aggravated or misrepresented, so asto alter the face of the whole story, and give it perfectlyanother air and turn, insomuch that, thoughmany things he says were true, yet he has hardlyspoke a true word that is told truly and nakedlywithout a warp." There is yet another line of viewin which this work must offend every man who entertainssound principles of law and loyalty, for who, thatcan endure its perusal, will approve of an ecclesiasticadvancing such principles, as that a king who designsto destroy a people abdicates the government ; that nooath of allegiance obliges any subject to assist hisprince in an ill cause ; that the king and the peoplehave a mutual power of dispensing with the laws, &c.,&c., &c.JOHN HOADLY.[Succ. 1729. Resign. 1742.]John Hoadly, the successor of Archbishop King,was born at Tottenham on the 27th of September,1678, the youngest son of the Rev. Samuel Hoadly,and brother to the learned and celebrated BenjaminHoadly, Bishop of Winchester. The father of theseillustrious brothers not only watched over their infancywith parental affection, but was himself theirinstructor in classic literature ; he perceived withdelight that they were possessed of unwearied industryand fine capacities, and, from a comparative estimateof their respective abilities, is said to have hazardeda prediction as to their future progress in life, whichsubsequent events did not altogether justify. MyJOHN HOADLY. 331son John, said he, will be a bishop, and Benjamin anarchbishop ; both attained episcopal dignity, but thearchbishopric was conferred not on the elder, but onthe younger of his sons.*The subject of the present memoir was chaplainto Bishop Burnet, and by him installed chancellorand canon residentiary of the church of Salisbury,archdeacon of Sarum, and rector of St. Edmund s inthat city, and was afterwards made canon of thechurch of Hereford by his brother when bishop of thatsee. By the king s letter of the 3rd of June, 1727?he was advanced to the sees of Leighlin and Ferns.George the First, however, having died on the llthof the same month, before cither he or his predecessor,Bishop Sort, could pass patent for their respectivepreferments, he procured confirmatory letters fromGeorge the Second, dated on the 10th of August, inthe same year, and was consecrated in Patrick s Churchon the 3rd of September following, by William,Archbishop of Dublin, and other assisting bishops.in 1 708 he preached in the Cathedral of Salisbury,before the judges of assize and the grand jury, on thetext from Daniel, " And those that walk in pride heis able to abase." In this, his sermon, he inveighedagainst following the latitudes of conscience and dishc5sent in religious matters. " When men throw offthe whole body of a Church government, because ofsome things that they dislike in that Church, andmake a separation upon the account of what theyNicholson s Lit y . Anecdotes, vol. iii.332 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.confess to be lawful, it is to be observed, whethersomething besides conviction may not have a hand init. And when those, who raise that government toan absolute divine necessity, yet resist and set themselvesagainst the authority of those who are possessedof it, it is much if the haughtiness and ambition ofsome, making use of the malice or ignorance ofothers, be not the real ground of the contest, especially,if we see it managed with all the contemptand slander possible, with equal heat and equal falsehood.Pride is the ground of rebellion and unjustmurmuring, of schism and opposition to our superiors;and so it is of the tyranny of superiors over thosewho are made subject unto them." In the same address,he thus alludes to the passing political scenes,and the respective characters of King Lewis the Fourteenthand Queen Anne. " A man, whom I doubtnot, you have all along seen that I have been describingto you, the scourge of Europe for a series of manyyears, who hath brought slavery upon all under him,and been preparing it for all around him, by all theviolence and base arts of pride and ambition. Hisown people he began with, whose liberties he hathcompletely ruined, and brought their parliaments andimmunities and laws into the compass of his ownwill, and taken away from them the very countenanceof freedom. Those of them, who professed not theking s religion, for that was the word, against themost sacred treaties, against repeated edicts, againstall gratitude ; men, that never did any thing to deserveit, except fixing him upon the throne, he hathJOHN HOADLY. 333either compelled to leave their conscience or theircountry and friends and estates. His neighbours hehas seized on by unjust pretensions, or invaded withgroundless wars, or cheated with perfidious treaties, orswallowed by forgery and broken faith, never showingthe least regard to justice or conscience, to decencyor reputation in the accomplishment of any ofhis designs ; but he hath in express terms, not beenashamed to make his glory the ground of a war,which he once undertook, that is to say, an unjustone ; and, because God has suffered him to proceedwith success in his tyranny, and hath made use ofhim as his axe and rod and staff, he hath been filledwith pride, and courted the most scandalous flatteries,and assumed the titles of invincible and immortal tohimself. And from the contraries of all these particulars,we may take a character of one, whom God isnow pleased to make use of to abase the pride of thisgreat tyrant ; of one, who knows herself made for thegood of her people ; who imitates the goodness ofhim on whom she acknowledges her dependence, inmaking it her glory to spread the good effects of herpower among her subjects; who feels the happinessof governing a free people, and will never teach ortempt them to violate that conscience, which is thesecurity of their obedience ; who, being easy and belovedat home, studies the peace and security of herneighbours, and sends assistance to the injured andoppressed ; who returns the praise of all to God,whose authority, and not her own she bears ; inshort, one whose only pride is the power she hath to334 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.make her own subjects happy, and others safe. Thisis she, whom he that is mighty hath magnified, andlie hath scattered the proud in the imagination oftheir hearts," &c.In 1715, on the elevation of his brother to thebishopric of Bangor, he preached the consecrationsermon at Ely House chapel, selecting for his text 2Cor. i. 12, in which, alluding to the Church of Englandand the establishment of the Protestant succession,he adds, " We have lately seen that Church aridthat government on the brink of ruin ; but, by theblessing of God on the wise conduct of our governors,preserved to us. It might have lain verymuch in us, when we had foreseen that danger, tohave prevented it by pressing that obedience, whichhad at other times been unreasonably exalted, andby teaching men not to surmise and murmur and betumultuous, and it was not sincerity that made anywho are in this Church and government careless andremiss in doing so ; but now that the danger is, bythe providence of God, gone over us, with no othereffect but that of greater strength and security, itmay lie in us to strengthen that security still furtherby preaching charity and peace and legal submission,by teaching men to place the unity of Christians notin opinions and outward worship, but in faith, andobedience, and love, and the happiness of a people inthe right they have to their liberties, and in the enjoymentof a prince, who is a tender assertor ofthem." In 1717 Sir Peter King, Chief Justice ofthe Common Pleas, presented him to the rectory ofJOHN HOADLY. 335Oakham in Surrey. In the same year he was one ofthe chaplains in ordinary to His Majesty, and preachedbefore the House of Commons at St. Margaret s,Westminster, on the text 1 Cor. x. 11, in which heagain warmly inculcated brotherly love and Christiancharity. " It is a grief and a shame," he said, " thatwe should come into the house of God, charged withthe resentment of party politics, which renders usnot very well disposed to pray with that charity,which is necessary to our being forgiven, or to hearwith that candour, which is necessary to our being;" and again, " There is nothing, I think,plainer in the rules of civil society, than that no manis to be abridged of his rights in it but for thosethings which immediately affect its security, andthere is nothing plainer in the gospel, than that sincerityand godly simplicity is our proper rejoicing beforeour Judge, and that our union to Christ, our head,and to one another consists in a union of faith andlove, arid not in an outward conformity of worship ;so that to compel men to this outward conformity,either by using them as schismatics from the body ofChrist, or as unfit and dangerous members of thecivil society, is not just either in politics or Christianity.I am free to speak thus of this matter, becauseall Churches are apt to be faulty in it, and all partiesapt to make advantage of their uncharitableness toone another, and to confine the favours that are intheir power to their own sect. Men, that have hadill designs, have ever made use of these prejudices toplay their common enemies at one another, and each336 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.side have been too glad to catch at these opportunitiesof destroying the other, though it hath been totheir own ruin." In this sermon also the prelateindulged very fully his taste for political disquisition,and, as it was spoken on the anniversary of themartyrdom of King Charles, such a course wasmore pressed upon his attention ; and he concludedwith a eulogy of the new sovereign, even more elaboratethan he had passed on Queen Anne duringher reign.At the close of the year in which King died, onthe 13th of January, 17*29? Hoadly was translated tothis see. Dean Swift thus alludes to this prelate inone of his letters to Pope : " I am lord mayor of 120houses, I am absolute lord of the greatest cathedralin the kingdom, am at peace with the neighbouringprinces, the lord mayor of the city and the archbishopof Dublin, only the latter, like the King of France,sometimes attempts encroachments on my dominionsas old Lewis did upon Lorraine." In November, 1 739 9the Duke of Devonshire being lord lieutenant, DoctorHoadly was of the privy council, when the proclamationwas issued, requiring all justices, magistrates,&c., to search for and seize arms in the possession ofany Papist or reputed Papist, and to prosecute anyPapist who should presume to carry arms contrary tothe intent of the proclamation. In 1741 was passedthe act 15 Geo. II. c. 5, enabling archbishops andbishops to demise part of their demesne lands, and tochange the sites of their mansion houses ; and, on the24th of October of the following year, Doctor HoadlyJOHN HOADLY. 337was translated to Armagh, having filled this seeduring thirteen years. In that interval he expendedabout 2,500 in overturning the ancient remains ofthe castle of Tallagh, and constructed from the materialsa convenient and elegant episcopal palace.At the time of his translation to Armagh, the Dukeof Devonshire was lord lieutenant of Ireland, and he,according to Doctor Kippis, made all solicitation forthe primacy needless within an hour after the news ofits vacancy had arrived in London. His expressionto the king was, that he could not do without himthere. " It is probable," adds Stuart,* " that as apolitician and a leading member of the privy council,Doctor Hoadly adopted the system of his predecessor,Primate Boulter, and supported what was thenabsurdly styled the English interest in this country,in marked contradistinction to that of its aboriginalinhabitants, as if the prosperity of the one party wereutterly incompatible with the welfare of the other, andthe power of the state were solely upheld by the discordsof the people." In accordance with this policyhis name appears annexed to a proclamation issued bythe privy council on the 28th of February, 1743, inwhich all justices of the peace and other persons officiallyempowered were strictly commanded to enforcethe penal laws, enacted in the ninth year of the reign ofKing William, for the caption and imprisonment of allpapal archbishops, bishops, Jesuits, friars, and otherecclesiastics ; but, as such transactions are more promise,of Armagh, p. 434.Z338 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.percy referable to the history of the Roman Catholicprelates, they are reserved for that portion of the work.In 1742 and 1744 he was one of the lords justices exercisingthe government of Ireland, and is recordedas having given peculiar satisfaction by his easinessof access 9 his general knowledge of the state of thecountry, his quick penetration, and the peculiar facilitywith which he despatched the public business.An instance of his liberality in the latter year will befound in the memoir of Doctor Linegar, the RomanCatholic Archbishop of Dublin at that period.After about four years enjoyment of the primacy,he died at Rathfarnham of fever, on the 19th ofJuly, 1/46, at the age of 68, and was burled privatelyat Tallagh, in the same vault with his lady andher mother. A contemporary describes him as havingbeen " pious, without superstition ; charitable, withoutostentation ; learned, without pride ; facetiousand entertaining, without levity ; and capable ofadapting his conversation to persons of all ages, manners,and professions." It is not to be forgotten thatPrimate Hoadly was a skilful agriculturist ; delightedin practical farming ; and was beloved by his tenantryand the landholders of the country, among whom hehad excited, both by his example and by judiciouspecuniary rewards, a strong desire to improve theirgrounds, and a generous spirit of emulation. In theliterary world, as a polemic writer, he displayedconsiderable acuteness and talent ; and, although notso powerful in argument as his brother, yet the styleof his composition was, perhaps, less intricate andCHARLES COBBE. 339perplexed than that of the Bishop of Winchester, ofwhom Pope sarcastically wrote :Swift for closer style,But Hoadly for a period of a mile."In 1703 he published a quarto volume, in defence ofBishop Burnet s exposition of the Thirty-nine Articlesof the Church of England. He also printed asecond work, in octavo, on the same subject, besidesvarious sermons.CHARLES COBBE.[Succ. 1742. Ob. 1765.]Charles Cobbe was born at Winchester, where hereceived the rudiments of his education ; hence heremoved to Trinity College, Oxford, but took hisdegree of doctor of divinity in the University ofDublin on the 9th of March, 1735. His first ecclesiasticalpreferment was to the rectory of Shrine, inthe diocese of Meath. He was afterwards appointedDean of Ardagh, whence he was promoted to thesees of Killala and Achonry, by letter of privy sealdated 30th of May, 1720. In 1726 he was translatedto the see of Dromore ; and from that, inMarch, 1731, to Kildare, with which latter dignityhe held the deanery of Christ Church, Dublin, andthe preceptory of Tully, in the county of Kildare,in commendam. On the 19th of July, 1734, he wassworn of the privy council ; and was finally translatedto this see by letters patent, dated 4th of March,1742.z 2340 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.In the parliament of 1743 he was one of thespiritual lords, who desired leave to be absent fromthe trial of Lord Netterville, by protestation, " savingto themselves and their successors all such right injudicature as they have by law, and of right oughtto have." At the same period he was one of thecouncil, (the Duke of Devonshire being then viceroy,)who subscribed the proclamation of February1743-4, alluded to in the life of Archbishop Hoadly.In September 1745, on the breaking out of the rebellionin Scotland, he addressed a circular letter tohis clergy from the palace of St. Sepulchre s, whereinhe directed them : " First, frequently to remindthose committed to their charge of the excellencyof that holy Protestant religion, which it is theirhappiness to profess and which is by law establishedin this kingdom ; to entreat them earnestly to besteadfast, even unto death, in the profession of it ; toadvise and caution them against the artful insinuationsof all those, who would persuade them to thinkfavourably of Popery ; to lay open the pernicioustendency of its doctrines; and to recommend thatspirit of concord and unanimity among Protestantsof all denominations, which was ever more their duty,and, in circumstances of danger, their strength andsecurity. Second, in their discourses from the pulpit,to lay open the nature and the consequencesof the horrid crime of rebellion ; to press upon theirhearers the important duties of loyalty and obedienceto his sacred Majesty King George, to which theywere bound by the laws of God and man, and byCHARLES COBBE. 341all the ties of public and private interest ; to inculcatefrequently and earnestly the dangerous absurditythere is in supposing, that their religion, theirliberties, and their properties, could by any acts orconditions be secured under a prince bigoted toPopery, and bred in the tyrannical principles ofarbitrary government ; and to exhort them constantlyand warmly to offer up their prayers to AlmightyGod, with the utmost fervency and devotion, to blessthe arms of his Majesty against his foreign and domesticenemies &c. &c. With this abhorrence, however,of " Popery" in connexion with the State, it iscreditable to this prelate to record, that when a billwas introduced in the House of Lords, of a very severepenal nature against the Roman Catholic clergy,in 1757, he and the Protestant Primate of Armaghspoke most strenuously against it, and, although itwas read a third time in that house, they contestedit to a division on every reading. Their minorityon the last occasion was twenty-one to twenty-four,nor indeed should it be forgotten, that in this minoritywere, of the Protestant hierarchy, four archbishopsand ten bishops, only four prelates beingamongst the supporters of the persecuting measure.In 1759 Archbishop Cobbe was very active inprocuring the investment of the charitable donations,bequeathed by Andrew Wilson, Esq. and the ReverendWilliam Wilson of Piersefield, in the county ofWestmeath, for the purpose of an hospital for suchaged men, being Protestants and decayed housekeepersof said county or other adjacent counties, as should342 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.be approved by the trustees of his will, their numbernot to exceed forty ; and also for the habitation ofsuch number of Protestant male children of the saidcounty or counties as approved of, not exceeding150, and also to build a school adjoining to saidhospital, said men and children to be supplied withdiet and clothing, their dress to be blue bound withorange, &c. Doctor Cobbe procured a bill to confirmthis endowment, and to enable himself and theother trustees to make leases of the lands so devised,being upwards of 3000 acres, the annual rental ofwhich was some few years since estimated at 5000.Archbishop Cobbe died at St. Sepulchre s, on the12th of April, 1765, in the 79th year of his age, andwas interred at the church of Unabated near Dublin,a large portion of which parish his Grace s descendantand namesake, Charles Cobbe, Esq., inherits. By hiswill he left 200 to the Incorporated Society, and50 towards building a chapel at the work house.WILLIAM CARMICHAEL.[Succ. 1765. Ob. eodem anno.]The Honourable William Carmichael was thesecond son of the second Earl of Sandford, and brotherof the third. In 1742 he was appointed Archdeaconof Bucks ; on the 5th of January, 1 753, wasconsecrated Bishop of Clonfert and Kilmacduagh;in 1756 he preached the anniversary sermon on King-charless martyrdom before the House of Lords,and received the usual vote of thanks; in 1758 wasARTHUR Smith. 343translated to the sees of Leighlin and Ferns, and inthe same year to that of Meath. On the 12th ofJune, 1 765, he was further translated from Meath tothis see, but died on the 15th of December in thesame year at Bath. He married Mrs. Godschall inAugust, 1 734, but left no issue.ARTHUR Smith.[Succ. 1766. Ob. 1771.]Arthur Smyth, Doctor of Divinity and Dean ofDerry, was by letters patent of March, 1 752, promotedto the united Bishoprics of Clonfert and ,and was consecrated in St. Andrew sChurch, Dublin, by John, Archbishop of Tuam. Byletters patent of January, 1 753, he was translated tothe sees of Down and Connor ; by privy seal dated1st of October, 1 765, was further translated to the seeof Meath, and thence on the 14th of April, 1766, tothis archbishopric. He died at his palace of St.Sepulchre s on the 14th of December, 1771? and wasburied with great solemnity in the choir of St. Patricks cathedral, where a superb monument waserected to his memory, designed by Mr. Smyth, thearchitect, and sculptured by Van Not.Archbishop Smyth amassed, during his preferments,property to the amount of 50,000, of whichhe bequeathed 1000 to augment the funds ofSwift s Hospital, 200 to the poor of St. Sepulchres, and 50 to those of the parish of Tallagh.His character has been thus drawn by his successor :344 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.He was endowed with talents* and qualified by experiencefor a due execution of the great trust committedto him, and both had received improvements from,(what is unquestionably a great acquisition but at thesame time a rare felicity to those of our order,) traveland observation. He had penetration to discern, at themost critical conjunctures, and firmness to accomplish,upon the most trying occasions, what appearedto him for the real benefit of the community, eitherin Church or State. In a word, his attention to hisduty kept pace with his knowledge of it. Howgreat his regard was for places of worship, and howjustly he is to be ranked in the number of those, who,in the warmth of David s phrase, have set theiraffection to the house of their God, appears fromthe improvements made by him, at no inconsiderableexpense, in the choir of the ancient and venerablefabric of St. Patrick s. His attention to the distressesof the most forlorn and pitiable of the humanspecies, is fully evinced by his liberality to St. Patricks Hospital, an institution as humane and considerateas was ever planned in any country, and wellworthy of its great founder, Swift"*JOHN Crack.[Succ. 1772. Ob. 1778.]John Cradock was born at Wolverton, educatedat Cambridge, where he took his degree of doctor ofArchbishop Cradock s Primary Charge.JOHN Crack. 345divinity, and by the patronage of Lord Gower becamerector of St. Paul s, Covent Garden, and subsequentlychaplain to the Duke of Bedford, whoseduchess was the daughter of Lord Gower. He accompaniedthis nobleman to Ireland in 1757, and, intwo months after his patron s appointment to theviceroyalty of that country, Doctor Cradock washimself elected to the see of Gilmore; and on the4th of December following consecrated bishop thereof,in St. Michael s Church, Dublin. In February,1772, he was translated to this see, and held his primaryvisitation in the June of that year, in which heparticularly inveighed against the Jesuits, recommendedthe preaching of occasional controversialsermons, exhorted his clergy to attend to the state ofthe charity schools, to visit and frequently inspectthe charter schools, ordered terriers of the severalparishes of the diocese to be completed and registered,and copies of the registries of baptisms, marriages,and burials in each parish to be given in annuallyat the visitation, enforced the expediency of theliturgy, residence of the clergy, c.In 1773 he was one of the eighteen peers, whoprotested against the passing of a bill, for securing therepayment of money lent by Papists to Protestantson mortgages of land ; Because," as the protest setsout, " all the laws made in this kingdom against Papistshave been the effect of their rebellions and treasonsagainst the State, and are to be considered astending to preserve the Protestant interest againstthe encroachments of Popery ; because the bill tends,340 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.in part, to repeal the Popery laws, which were madeby those who immediately saw and experienced theintolerant principles of the Popish religion, and itsenmity to the civil rights of mankind ; because that,as attempts to introduce bills in favour of Papistshave become frequent, the number of converts to theestablished religion has decreased in proportion, andthis decrease is particularly observable in the two lastyears ; because the great object and tendency of thePopery laws being to prevent an increase of Popishinfluence, and to operate as encouragements to conformity,this bill tends to defeat both these purposes ;because the Papists, who have now no other methodof employing their money than in trade, or by lendingit on personal security, or by subscribing to thepublic loans, and thereby contributing to support thecredit of this kingdom, will, should this bill pass intoa law, be induced to call in all the money, which theyhave lent on personal security to tradesmen and manufacturers,which, as we conceive, forms a considerablepart of that capital by which the trade ofthis country is supported, and thereby necessarilylessen the extent of our trade, cause a considerabledecrease in our exports, and, consequently, reducemany of our manufacturers to want and beggary, orforce them to seek employment in foreign countries;nor, as we conceive, will the evil consequences ofthis bill stop here ; for, should the public have occasionfor future loans, it is not to be imagined thatPapists will lend their money at four per cent, to government,(as they now do,) or, even at four and anROBERT FOWLER. 34 /half per cent., when they can lend it on mortgages,at an interest of six per cent," &e. &c.* In 1777 heincurred the vituperative assaults of Doctor Duigenan,who, in the pamphlet " Lachrymal Academical"took occasion to censure him, on account of his having,as visiter of Trinity College, spoken rather favourablyof the Provost Hutchinson, against whomthat pamphlet was written. Doctor Cradock diedon the 1 th of December in the ensuing year, and wasburied in St. Patrick s Cathedral. Cole says he was"a portly, well-looking man, of a liberal turn ofmind, and a social and generous disposition."ROBERT FOWLER.[Succ. 1778. Ob. 1801.]Robert Fowler, Doctor of Divinity and Prebendaryof Westminster, received his education at TrinityCollege, Cambridge, where he took the successivedegrees of bachelor of arts in 1747, master ofarts in 1751, and doctor of divinity in 1764. In177U during the administration of Lord Townshend,he was promoted to the see of Killaloe and Kilfenora,and on the 28th of July, in that year, consecrated inSt. Patrick s Cathedral by the Archbishop of Dublin.In 1773 he was ordered by the House of Lordsto preach before them at Christ Church on the 2ndof October, " being an anniversary thanksgiving forthe deliverance of the Protestants of this kingdomLords Journals, vol. iv. p. 702, &c.348 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.from the Popish massacre in 1641." On the 22nd ofDecember, 1778, during the administration of LordBuckingham, he was translated to this see ; his letterspatent were passed on the 8th of January following,and, on the 13th of the same month, he was solemnlyenthroned in Christ Church.In 1782 he was one of twelve spiritual peerswho protested against the bill for the relief of theDissenters, as likely to promote every species of clandestineand improvident marriages, and those evenwithin prohibited degrees, without publication ofbans and without license or consent, &c. In 1789he concurred with fourteen other peers in protestingagainst the memorable address of the Irish House ofLords to the Prince of Wales, and against theirresolution, that by such address they discharged anindispensable duty, " because," as the dissentientsalleged, " the assuming a right in the Lords andCommons of Ireland alone, to confer upon his RoyalHighness the Prince of Wales the government ofthis kingdom, under the style and title of PrinceRegent of Ireland in the name and on the behalf ofhis Majesty, to exercise and administer, according tothe laws and constitution of this kingdom, all regalpowers and prerogatives to the crown and governmentthereof belonging, or the addressing his RoyalHighness to take upon him such government in manneraforesaid, before he be enabled by law so to do,seems to us altogether unwarrantable, and to behighly dangerous, in its tendency to disturb and breakthe constitutional union, whereby this realm of Ire-charlesAGAR. 349land is for ever knit and united to the imperial crownof England, on which connexion the happiness ofboth kingdoms essentially depends ; and we are themore apprehensive of danger, lest the so doingshould be considered as tending to the prejudice, disturbance,or derogation of the king s majesty in, of,or for the crown of this realm of Ireland"* Healso joined in protesting against the resolution of thelords, that the answer of the lord lieutenant, refusingto transmit the address, was disrespectful to his RoyalHighness and conveyed an unwarrantable censure onboth houses of parliament.During the two last years of his life he residedfor the benefit of his health at Bassingbourne Hall,near Dunno in Essex, a seat which his Grace hadpurchased from the Earl of Brandon, and there he diedon the 10th of October, in the year 1801, leavingissue one son the present Bishop of Ossory, and twodaughters, the eldest, Mary Countess of Kilkenny,the second married to the Hon. Richard Bourke,next brother of the Earl of Mayo.CHARLES AGAR.[Succ. 1801.

He was educated in Westminster school,and subsequently at Christ Church, Oxford ; in thehall of which college is his portrait, as also the portraitof his grandfather, Welbore Ellis, and of hisuncle, Welbore Ellis, Lord Mentis. Having enteredinto holy orders, he was appointed first chaplainto the Duke of Northumberland whilst lord lieutenantof Ireland in 1763; from which situation hewas promoted to the deanery of Gilmore, and to thesee of Cloyne in 1768. In 1779 he was translatedto that of Cashel, over which he presided for twenty-twoyears, and during that interval completed therepairs of its fine cathedral and erected a new choir.He also caused all the old churches in the diocese tobe restored, eleven new to be built, nine new glebesto be purchased, and nineteen glebe houses erected.At this period of his life, he acquired 40,000on a single fine for the Palliser estate, by runninghis own life against that of the existing lessee.In 1795 he was elevated to the peerage as BaronMerton, and yet higher, as Viscount Mertonin 1800.In 1801 he was translated to the Archbishopricof Dublin, and was one of the representative spiritualpeers in the first imperial parliament. In 1806 he wasfurther dignified with the title of Earl of Normanton.He also enjoyed the honours and offices of privycouncillor, trustee of the linen manufactory, governorof the Lying-in Hospital, and vice-president of theCharitable Musical Society ; during all which preferments,he is said to have amassed a fortune ofCHARLES AGAR. 351400,000. In 1807 he and the other prelates ofthe Established Church were commanded by his Majesty,to make a minute return of the state of theIrish Church in their respective provinces and sees,and in a visitation of the same year he directed,with a too long deferred regard for the workingclergy, that the incumbents of the diocese should forthe future pay to their curates 75 per annum, insteadof 50 theretofore allowed. In the followingyear, he was the promoter of a bill for securing theestates and funds devised by the Rev. Richard Daniel,in trust to apply the profits for the relief of the poorof St. Luke s parish in the city of Dublin, the supportof the hospital of incurables and other charitableinstitutions, &c. In the July of the following year,becoming sensible of the approach of death, he presentedhis son (the present Archdeacon of Gilmore)to the valuable prebendal stall of St. Michael in ChristChurch Cathedral, and, dying on the 14th of thatmonth, in the 73rd year of his age, at his house inGreat Cumberland-street, London, was buried inWestminster Abbey. He left issue by his wife, thedaughter of Mr. Benson a merchant of Dublin, threesons, to the eldest of whom his heraldic honours descended,and a daughter who had intermarried withViscount Warden.The inability or reluctance of his Grace s relativesto afford any materials for this memoir, leaves onlythe foregoing particulars to record, while in truththe principal events of this prelate s life arc morelegitimately connected with the Church history of352 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.Cashel ; and it remains only here to add, that in histime the act was passed for vesting in the Crown thearchiepiscopal palace of St. Sepulchre, and applyingthe purchase money for the purposes therein named.EUSEBY CLEAVER.[Succ. 1809. Ob. 1819.]This prelate was a native of Buckinghamshire.His father, the Rev. William Cleaver, was for manyyears master of a very respectable school at Twofold,in that county, whose vicinity to Stowe, with thehigh character of this divine, caused his introductionto the Grenville family. His eldest son becamethereupon tutor to the Marquis of Buckinghamwhile that young nobleman was a student at ChristChurch, Oxford, an event which in due time producedimportant results to the whole family ; for,while the elder brother obtained the bishoprics ofChester, Bangor, and St. Asaph, in succession, theyounger, the subject of this notice, who also receivedhis education in Christ Church, where he took thedegree of master of arts in 1770, and in 1778 thatof doctor of divinity, was preferred in 1783 by theEarl of Egmont to the rectory of Wellington andanother benefice in Sussex; and in 1787 accompaniedthe Marquis of Buckingham on the occasion ofhis second residence as a viceroy in Ireland.In March, 1789> he was consecrated Bishop ofCork, in June of the same year translated to the seesof Leighlin and Ferns, as bishop of which he, inJOHN GEORGE DE LA Power BERESFORD. 3531801, on the disfranchisement of the ancient boroughof Old Leighlin, claimed the usual compensationmoney, 15,000, on the allegation that " it had beenusual and customary for the lord bishop of Leighlinand Ferns, to nominate and appoint chiefly the beneficedclergy of the united dioceses of Leighlin andFerns, as burgesses of the said corporation, whichgave the said dioceses an interest in the rights andadvantages of the same." He finally obtained thisarchiepiscopal dignity in 1809. No circumstance ofpublic interest has been discovered respecting himwhile in this his last and highest preferment. Aftera long residence in Ireland he married a lady of thatcountry, by whom he had several children, and diedin the close of the year 1819 at Tunbridge Wells.JOHN GEORGE DE LA Power BERESFORD.[Succ. 1820. Resign. 1822.]This prelate was the third son of the first Marquisof Waterford. In 1805 he was consecratedBishop of Cork, in 1807 was translated to Raphoe,and in 1819 was further translated to the see ofClogher. In 1820 he succeeded Archbishop Cleaverin this dignity. In 1821 he procured an act, enablinghimself and his successors to demise the mansion houseand demesne of Tallagh, belonging to this see, longthe country residence of its prelates ; and in the sotlowing year he was further promoted to the primacyof Armagh, which dignity he still enjoys, and towhose Church history the memoir of his life is moreespecially terrible.2 A354 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.WILLIAM MAGEE.[Succ. 1822. Ob. 1831.]The subject of the present memoir, having beenthe son of persons in a very humble station of life,was not indebted for any of his promotions to theordinary advantages of family or fortune. He enteredas a sizer in the University of Dublin, and inthe studies of its course soon manifested his proficiency,especially in the metaphysical and ethicalsciences ; and in due time, after ordination, obtaineda fellowship, and the assistant professorship of orientaltongues in the said establishment. In 1 797 he preacheda " thanksgiving sermon on the delivery of thiskingdom from invasion." In 1801 he published hisDiscourses on the Scriptural Doctrines of Atonementand Sacrifice," a work more illustrative oferudition than genius ; but, undoubtedly, the greatcause of his promotion in the Church. In 1802 hepreached and published a " Sermon, occasioned bythe Death of the Earl of Clare," an undeviating effusionof panegyric from beginning to end ; and in1804, a " Memoir of the Life of the celebrated DoctorPercival of Manchester." About the year 1806 hebecame a senior fellow and professor of mathematics,and, being intimately acquainted with every branchof that science, he selected, for the use of the candidatesfor fellowship, a course both concise and elementary.The popularity, which his work on theAtonement had by this time acquired, caused his promotionin 1813 to the deanery of Cork, from whichWILLIAM MAGEE. 355dignity he was advanced in 1819 to the see of Ra-shoe.In October, 1821, he held his primary visitationof that diocese, on which occasion he delivered acharge, of which the following extracts may proveinteresting : speaking of confirmation, he said, " Itmay be conceived as the consummation of baptism ; itgives to that rite, in common view, significancy andsubstance ; and what before appeared as the gratuitousadoption of the unconscious infant into the visibleChurch of Christ, becomes now the voluntary acceptanceof the Christian covenant, and the spiritual initiationof the intelligent and instructed ; so that withthose, who cannot comprehend the value of infantbaptism, it may be considered, with a certain latitude,as the baptism of the adult. Again, as confirmationis prescribed by the Church, as the legitimate introductionof the young Christian to the holy communion,it presents itself as an intelligible and connectingmedium between our two great sacraments.. . ." In the same discourse he deprecated all deviationsfrom the rubric in administering divine service." In the course of my circuit," he says, " I observedparts of the Liturgy disturbed from their dueorder ; in some, certain prayers were omitted ; insome, they were altered ; and, on the whole, libertieswere taken, not unfrequently, with the directions ofthe Rubric, as if the performance of the service wereleft to the direction of the individual minister ; or, asif some of the matters prescribed were of such triflingimport, as to render it a thing of indifference, whenA2356 ARCHBISHOPS OF Dublin.ther they were conformed to or not They,who dissent from the Rubric, offend against the lawof the land, for the Act of Uniformity enjoins onthem an undeviating adherence to all its forms ; andthey break through their own most solemn engagements,for, on their admission to holy orders, as wellas on their appointment to their several cures, theyhave bound themselves repeatedly, by their deliberateand recorded declarations, to an exact conformity to theBook of Common Prayer." Further, alluding to theexisting variations in the discipline of the Church, hecondemned the administering of baptism in privatehouses, impugned the conduct of such clergymen asmingled in secular pursuits. " If they act so, theyare not only acting in violation of their vows and indefeasance of their usefulness, but they are flingingfrom them that very respect and estimation whichthey are making these sacrifices to obtain. . . . Theparish priest becomes lost in the country gentleman,and the spiritual guide superseded by the sociable companion."In this charge he styles the Socinian " themost presumptuous, and the least informed of all sects."In 1822 he was translated to the see of Dublinby the late Lord Liverpool, and held his primaryvisitation immediately afterwards in St. Patrick sCathedral, when, instead of enforcing and recommendingthat conciliatory spirit, so recently urgedby King George in his parting injunction to hisIrish subjects, he fulminated a sweeping denunciationagainst the immense majority of those subjects,and, in a childish indulgence of that figure of oratory,WILLIAM MAGEK. 357that is the most dangerous to indulge in, he rashlyinsulted them, on the hard labour of whose handshis revenues, and those of his clergy, then so greatlydepended. In his charge on this occasion he says,we, my reverend brethren, are placed in a stationin which we are hemmed in by two opposite descriptionsof professing Christians, the one possessing aChurch, without what we can properly call a religion,and the other possessing a religion, without what wecan properly call a Church; the one so blindly enslavedto a supposed infallible ecclesiastical authority,as not to seek in the word of God a reason for thefaith they profess, the other so confident in the infallibilityof their individual judgment as to thereasons of their faith, that they deem it their dutyto resist all authority in matters of religion. We,my brethren, are to keep clear of both extremes, and,holding the scriptures as our great charter, whilstwe maintain the liberty with which Christ has madeus free, we are to submit ourselves to the authorityto which he has made us subject." Turning fromthis ill-judged and unfounded strain of abusive antithesis,he inveighed with more propriety against theexercise of private judgment, and the wandering ofclergy or congregation to fashionable churches. Theparochial clergy, he adds, should carefully consider,how far their negligence or frequent absence fromtheir appropriate station, or their substitution ofothers for the discharge of duties properly their own,may have produced this evil, by undermining therespect and interest with which the parish minister358 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.should always be viewed The parish ministerhas no right to depute another to the chargeassigned to him, but under the special authority bywhich that charge had been conveyed. There is nopoint in which the laws of the Church are moreperemptory and more unqualified than in this, thatno person shall exercise the functions of a preacher orparish minister, without the express permission of thebishop within whose diocese he wishes to officiate."Alluding to the duty of clerical residence, he thusbeautifully expressed himself. " The clergyman shouldbe the true parish priest, in continual contact withhis flock, one whose voice they know, not only inconstantresidence amongst them but in continualintercourse with them; their adviser, their friend,the moderator of their disputes, the composer of theirdifferences, the careful instructor of their children ;not content merely to afford spiritual aid where itmay be demanded, but vigilant to discover where itmay be applied, and prompt to bestow it where itwill be received ; stimulating all, and particularlythe young, to come to that fountain of living waterswhich it is his office to dispense, and proving to hispeople by every possible exertion, that the first objecthe has at heart is their everlasting welfare."In this charge he further deplored " the relaxedstate of Church discipline in this country," and especiallyin the diocese of Dublin, which, " for a considerableseries of years, had been deprived of theadvantage of effective episcopal control adding,that, except in the time of his immediate predecessor,WILLIAM MAGEE. 35Qthe discipline of this diocese might be said to havebeen totally neglected." It is to be remarked, thatone of perhaps the ablest letters even Doctor Doyleever wrote, was an overwhelming comment on thearrogant and uncharitable portion of this discourse.In consistence with this avowal of bigotry. DoctorMagee became subsequently the great promoterof the new Reformation in Ireland, a species of religiousagitation which effected no object, but todisturb the Christian charities of the country, andwhose agitation has not even yet subsided. His oppositionto the burial of a Roman Catholic in thechurchyard of St. Peter s parish, on the pretext ofsome legal form not having been complied with, wasthe consummation of his sectarian virulence, and byactually necessitating the establishment of RomanCatholic cemeteries, and enforcing exclusiveness thegrave, he out-herded all the efforts that unchristianingenuity ever concerted even for the division ofIreland. His conduct on this occasion was brought beforeparliament in a petition signed by Mr. Devereux,of the county Wexford, and Mr. Eneas M Donnellll,of the county of Mayo. He is known also to haveprohibited the natives of the valley of Glendaloughfrom celebrating mass, as they had theretofore done,in their ancient and venerated cathedral of St. Kevin,availing himself of his right as archbishop to theground on which the chapel stood. His evidence in1825, before a committee of the House of Lords, isan eloquent testimony to his character and opinions,indeed to the whole story of his life; but as it has360 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.been the only portion of these " Memoirs," whichthe author could have wished he was not necessitatedto sketch, he much prefers referring the reader towhat it can answer no national or charitable object toreprint ; and on the same principle he has studiouslyavoided any details or comments, that were not absolutelynecessary for the illustration of the subject. In thelatter period of his life he was reduced to a state offeebleness and childishness, that was ungenerouslycharacterized as the immediate visitation of Providence.On the 2nd of August, 1831, he was attackedby paralysis, died on the 18th of the samemonth at Pedestal House, near Stillorgan, aged 66years, and was buried within the ruins of the ancientchurch of Rathfarnham. It but remains to mention,that during his life-time he provided munificentlyfor his sons, four of whom he brought up in his ownprinciples and profession.RICHARD Whatever.[Succ. 1831. Vivens 1838.]All endeavours to obtain for this work any authenticor satisfactory particulars of the life of Doctor Whateverhaving utterly failed, even in quarters where arefusal could least be expected, the following noticemust be considered rather a catalogue of his Grace sliterary productions, than a memoir of his life ; as,however, his name is in truth more associated withthese productions, than with any ecclesiastical orpolitical act of importance, and as his Grace is stillRICHARD Whatever. 36 iliving in the public eye and estimate, the deficienciesof this sketch may be the more easily excused.In 1821, being then a fellow of Oriel College, here-published Archbishop King s work on Predestination,with comments. In 1822 he preached the annualeight Hampton sermons before the University ofOxford, selecting for his subject, " the use and abuseof party feeling in matters of religion." In the followingyear he published five sermons, which he hadpreached before the same body : 1, on the Christianduty of obedience to the rulers ; 2, on the Christianduty of obedience to the laws ; 3, on national blessingsand judgments ; 4, on the use of human learningin matters of religion ; and 5, on Christ being theonly priest under the Gospel. In this latter, althoughhe speaks of " the superstition and tyranny of theRomish Church," he yet " beseeches both parties tolay aside all bitterness of animosity, and abstain " frombranding each other too hastily as persecuting bigots,or as lukewarm latitudinarians, nor rashly toattribute to their opponents motives which they disavow."In 1825 he published " Essays on some ofthe Peculiarities of the Christian Religion," which hededicated to Lord Grenville. In 1826 " Letters onthe Church by an Episcopalian." In 1828 "Essayson the Writings of St. Paul," and "Elements ofRhetoric." In 1829 a very curious little work, entitled" Scripture Revelations on a future State."And in the same year, his " Elements of Logic," awork which the Edinburgh Review has handled veryseverely, characterizing its author as " indistinct, ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.bilious, and even contradictory," and adding, thatit is only by applying the most favourable impressionto his words, that he can be allowed credit forany thing like a correct opinion." In 1830 he wasprincipal of St. Alban s Hall, and published his " Errorsof Romanism," under the several heads of Superstition,Vicarious Religion, Pious Frauds, UndueReliance on human Authority, Persecution,and Trust in Names and Privileges ; this work hededicated to the Reverend Joseph Blanc White.In 1831 he was principal of St. Alban s Hall, Oxford,when he gave to the world his " Essay on the Omissionof Creeds, Liturgies, and Codes of EcclesiasticalCanons," and his " Introductory Letters on PoliticalEconomyIn the latter year he was consecrated Archbishopof Dublin ; in 1832 published "Essays on SecondaryPunishments;" and in 1835 a volume of fifteen sermonsdelivered by him in his diocese. From all theseworks the writer of " Random Recollections of theHouse of Lords" has drawn the following estimateof his Grace. " He is better known as an authorthan as a legislator ; in the former capacity he standsunrivalled among his contemporaries in the particulardepartments of literature to which he has speciallyapplied himself. His works on rhetoric and logicare perhaps the best which have ever been writtenon the subjects. They abound with evidences of profoundthought, varied knowledge, great mental acuteness,and superior powers of reasoning ; but his theologicalcreed cannot, according to the representationsRICHARD Whatever. 363of persons who have entered the lists with him, becommended for its orthodoxy."The brevity of these " Memoirs," in reference tothe later archbishops, is not to be attributed to anyneglect or omission of their compiler in applying, bothby public advertisement, and by private letters, forfuller and authentic materials ; and he confidentlyhoped, that the magnitude of the undertaking inwhich he was engaged, with such a devotion of histime, his researches, and his money, would be cheerfullyresponded to by every competent authority. Inthe above important instance, however, his expectationswere utterly extinguished, and, with the singleexception of Mr. Cobbe of New-Bridge, the individualsapplied to either refused to answer ; or, as inthe instance of one other more intimately connectedwith a memoir, absolutely refused to communicatewhat he could not but have well known. On newspapernotices, written in a temper and time whenthe acts of many of the respective prelates were therallying points of a party, it would be utterly unsafe,and contrary to the spirit of this book, to rely, as itwould equally, and for the same reasons, on the oralinformation of mere politicians. Had these " Memoirs"been extended with such details, they wouldhave been a tissue of popular opinions not of historicaltruths.MEMOIRSOF runROMAN CATHOLICARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN,SINCE THE REFORMATION.IN commencing these Memoirs, it is a painful dutyto express, at once, surprise and regret, that solittle has been done for the biography of the many,who have distinguished themselves in the arduousand long persecuted profession of the Roman Catholicpriesthood in Ireland. It would have been butalong merited tribute to departed piety and excellence; yet, is still suffered to descend only in oraltraditions from generation to generation, more uncertainand, consequently, less revered by each successivetransmission. While a code of religious persecution,that assumed to legislate for the worship ofthe Deity, was suffered to crush the spirit and voiceof Ireland, it could hardly be expected, that anyattempt should be made to draw into notice thepreachers and prelates of the proscribed faith ; thewriter, the printer, the vender, the collector of their366 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.martyrologies would but subject themselves to participatein their sufferings. But, happily, those timeshave passed, and what was then, perhaps, a justifiablesilence, is now a sacrilegious apathy. The ecclesiasticalhistory of the Island of Saints should not be deficientin so important a portion ; and, while thewriter of this work will cheerfully contribute hiscollections to so creditable a design, he hopes thatthe patriotic contributions of others will not be wantinghereafter, to fill up this hiatus in the literarypomcerium.After Hugh Curwen had, in 1559? abandonedthe faith which he early professed, the parliamentaryassertion of Queen Elizabeth s supremacy, and theimprisonments, banishments, persecutions, and ecclesiasticalspoliations, that ensued, as recorded in theAnalecta Sacra" of the eloquent Doctor Roth,Roman Catholic Bishop of Ossory, prevented the appointmentof a prelate to this province for upwards offorty years ; during the whole of which interval, suchseverities were exercised over consciences, as weresufficient to impel the most peaceful and enduringpeople to vengeance and insubordination ; nor wasforeign influence wanting to effectuate such unhappyconsequences. The Roman Catholic potentates onthe continent were soon apprised of the ordeal towhich their faith was subjected in Ireland ; and ambitionand sympathy united to attract their attentionand direct their energies to its estrangement fromBritish government ; yet, is it a proud testimony torecord, that all political intrigues were incompetentARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN. 867to loosen the allegiance of this suffering but loyalpeople.At length a riotous insurrection, headed by JamesFits-Maurice, the brother of the Earl of Desmond,provoked by the imprisonment of that unfortunatenobleman, and magnified at the Spanish court intoan open rebellion against Elizabeth, induced Philipthe Second to afford to the importunity of the insurgentchief a troop of about eighty Spaniards, whilehe at the same time sent with the expedition a Franciscanfriar, named Matthew de Oviedo, chargedwith the important duty of ascertaining the truestate of Ireland, and making his report upon itsprospects. Happily the expedition was wholly unsuccessful,the rash leader perished in a brawl, andde Oviedo returned to his native country, whence,however, he was destined to revisit this in a capacitymore legitimately connected with the object of thiswork. Succeeding efforts to seduce the Irish into arebellious vindication of their wrongs were equallyineffective, and it is grateful to read over the list,which O Sullivan records, of those lords and chieftains,who, while subjected to all the penalties ofprofessing the Catholic religion, renounced theirresentments, adhered to the interests of QueenElizabeth in defiance of foreign influence and assumedauthority, and fought against the King ofSpain, against O Neill, O Donne, and O Sullivan.Those deluded Irish, 5 as the latter chieftain wouldfain characterize them, were found in both classes ofthe Irish proprietary, as well the native Irish chiefs,(amongst whom are enumerated Denis O Brien,368 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.Earl of Thomond, Mac Carthy Dun, chief of Carry,Cathay Mac Carthy, chief of Musketry, MauriceO Brien, Baron of Inchiquin, O Conor Don, titularKing of Connaught, O Melaghlin, Prince of Meath,)as many of the great lords of the English pale; (amongstwhom appear the names of the Earl of Ormondee, ViscountButtevant, Lord Dunboyne, Bourke, BaronCastleconnel, Uric Bourke, and his son Richard Earlof Clanrickard, Theobald Bourke, Bermingham,Baron Dunmore, Henry, William, and Gerald Fitzgerald,Lords of Kildare, St. Lawrence, Baron ofHowth, Preston, Lord Cranston, Nugent, Baronof Melvin, Fleming, Baron of Slane, Barnewall, Baronof Ballysmale, in Meath, Plunket, Baron Dunsany,Plunket, Baron of Killed, &c.) Not all the innovationsand persecutions that taunted them could shakethe allegiance of these illustrious laymen, nor werethe majority of the clergy, although, perhaps, morekeenly sensitive of the trials of the faith, less temperatein their demeanour towards the tyrants of theday. " Candour obliges us to acknowledge," saysLeland, " that the Romish clergy at this period,"speaking of the era of the armada, " did not uniformlyconcur in exciting the Irish to insurrections.Sullivan himself confesses, although it was his businessto represent the religious zeal of his countrymenin the most advantageous point of view, that a considerableparty among this clergy recommended adutiful submission to government, and opposed thepractices of their more intemperate brethren"*Leland s Hist, of Ireland, vol. ii. p. 306.ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN. 369The passiveness of the subject did not, however,ingratiate the good-will of the ruler ; the feelings ofthe Irish Catholics continued to be insulted, with suchcircumstances of exasperation as are best pourtrayedin a letter of the 14th of March, 1599, from theEarl of Desmond to the King of Spain, published inStafford s Pacata Hibernia. " We are of long time,"writes Desmond, " opprest by the English nation ;their government is such as Pharaoh himself neverused the like, for they content not themselves withalltemporal superiority, but by cruelty desire ourblood and perpetual destruction ; to blot out the wholeremembrance of our posterity, as also our old Catholicreligion, and to swear that the Queen of Englandis supreme of the Church ;" and he thereuponcraved the King of Spain to assist him against his oppressors." Assist me in this goodly enterprise withsome help of such necessaries for the wars as yourMajesty shall think requisite, and (after the quiet ofmy country) satisfaction shall be truly made for thesame ; and, myself in person, with all my forces, shallbe ready to serve your Highness in any country yourMajesty shall command me."Upon receipt of this letter, the Spanish monarchagain invited from his monastery the ecclesiastic beforealluded to, and, by his interest at the court ofHome, Matthew de Oviedo revisited Ireland in Mayof the year 1600, in the high and responsible situationof Archbishop of Dublin.2 B370 ARCHBISHOPS OF Dublin.MATTHEW DE OVIEDO.[Succ. 1600. ]This ecclesiastical emissary and agent of Philip theSecond, was born in Segovia, and received his educationat Salamanca, " where," writes Samuel Lew-tenorin the reign of Elizabeth, " all kind of learnwas by most excellent men, with incredible industry,professed." He subsequently became a Franciscanfriar, and presided for some time over themonastery of his order, at Toro in the diocese ofZamora in Old Castile.* On his revisiting Ireland,as before mentioned, although appointed to the ecclesiasticalgovernment leinster, he immediately proceededto fulfil what seems to have been a more congenialobject ; and, without a notice or observation of hisdiocese, he hurried into Ulster, eager to deliver hiscredentials to the chieftains, O Neill and O Donnellll,who still exercised an almost uncontrolled sovereigntyover that province. As soon as he had assured himselfof their services in the meditated Spanish invasion,he returned to his royal master, who seemed soconfident in his powers of negotiation, as to attachhim to the suite of Don Juan D Aguila, with whom,and the Spanish forces designed for the emancipationof Ireland, he landed at Kindle on the 2nd of October,1601. Immediately on their arrival, a proclamation,which had been printed in Spain in the Septemberof that year, and was addressed to the Catho-wadding.Annal. T. v. p. 246.MATTHEW DE OVIEDO. 371lies of Ireland, was promulgated by Don Juan. Inthis manifesto, with the avowed policy that might besupposed to actuate a Spanish government, D Aguilabitterly upbraided them for not considering, thatElizabeth was an excommunicated heretic, and thatthey could not fight in her cause without being hereticsthemselves ; and, after lavishing the fairest promiseson the Irish gentry, if they would abandon thequeen, he concluded by declaring, that, if they wouldobstinately persevere in supporting the cause of anexcommunicated heretic, he would be compelled totreat them as incorrigible heretics themselves, and topersecute them as such even unto death.* Yet, althoughhis most strenuous efforts were warmly secondedby the presence and exhortations of de Oviedo,a prelate of their own communion, neither temptationnor threats could alienate the loyalty of Irish Catholics."None of account," admits Morrison, "repairedto the Spaniards, except some dependants ofFlorence MacCarthy, who was then in prison, and hadinvited them over. Don Juan offered six shillingsper day to every horseman among the Irish thatwould join his standard, so that it is a wonder untous, that from present staggering they fall not into flatdefection"!On the 12th of October, 1601, Archbishop deOviedo wrote to O Neill and O Donnellll a letter, inwhich he openly avows himself the liege subject ofO Conor s History.

In the mean time I have pretermittednothing which might tend to your profit, aswell to our Catholic master, as any other whosoever,which now also in Spain I will perform : I wouldtherefore entreat your Excellency that you would beof a good courage, together with all other of yourfaction, and that you would fight constantly and valiantlyfor the faith and the liberty of your country,knowing and firmly hoping that the help of my lord theCatholic king is now coming, which, when it cometh,all things shall be prosperous, and will place you inyour former liberty and security, that ye may possessyour desired peace and tranquillity.

A fugitive and a wandererfrom the diocese of his charge, de Oviedo passed theremainder of his days in Spain, a pensioner on thecourt, and died in obscurity. Fortunately for theinterests and welfare of this country, his was the onlyinstance of what may be properly called foreign influencein the appointments to this high dignity.On the death of Queen Elizabeth, and the accessionof the son of Mary Queen of Scots to the throne,the hopes of the Irish Catholics naturally revived; theyARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN. 3J5commenced fitting up the chapels, re-building theconvents, and even restoring the ancient rites andceremonies ; the hemisphere brightened, the fountainsof persecution seemed closed at once, and thelong exiled were returning to their families andhomes. " Never did any monarch," as the late DoctorO Conor justly observes, "ascend a throne undersuch happy auspices, as those under which Jamesascended that of Ireland. Harassed by the Tyronewars our great chiefs were glad of an opportunity,which that accession afforded, to settle the peace ofthe kingdom on a foundation of permanent security.For this purpose they proclaimed, with loud and universalenthusiasm throughout every part of the kingdom,that James was a monarch of their own race; thatthe blood of their ancient kings flowed in his veins ;that their ancestors had crowned Robert Bruce atDundalk, in 1315, for that very reason; that theirmonarchy was indeed hereditary, but that by the lawof ministry they could elect any senior, provided hewas of the royal race ; that James was of that royalrace; that he was destined by Providence to sit on theLiafail, the sacred stone of inauguration of the Irishkings, which is still preserved at Westminster; that hewould unite three kingdoms as the shamrock, thesymbol of the Trinity ; and that he would heal all thewounds which had been inflicted on Ireland throughoutthe preceding period of 440 years. James himself,and the learned of Scotland, concurred with thebards of Ireland in this grand principle of hereditarydescent," but, as the nephew of the venerable doc-archbishopsOF DUBLIN.tor observes in his History of the Irish Catholics.,(p. 16.) " James, of all men, was the most unfit forcomposing the disorders of the times ; a determinedand implacable enemy to the Catholic religion, healienated its professors from all attachment to his governmentby the virulence of his antipathy ; one ofhis first gracious proclamations imported a generalgaol delivery, except to murderers and Papists ; onhis arrival at Newcastle, the frontier town of England,he gave liberty to all the prisoners except to thoseconfined for treason, murder, and papistry ; and, byanother proclamation, he pledged himself never togrant any toleration to the Catholics, and entailed acurse on his posterity if they granted any. To Irelandhe was equally hostile ; he and his ministersconceived that its prosperity would be the underminingof England ; that tranquillity and order wouldproduce a rivalship of trade and manufactures, thata union amongst its inhabitants might operate to thedissolution of the connexion. To prevent that union,to keep up distinctions and animosities, to exasperateparties, became accordingly the great objects of hispolicy. His views were favoured by the state ofthings at his accession, and of that state he took advantagewith a degree of address and malignitycreditable to his talents for oppression."On the 22nd of February in the first year of hisreign, a proclamation issued from the court of Westminster,commanding all priests, secular and regular, withinthe kingdom, to abjure the realm before the 19th ofMarch ensuing ; and all archbishops, bishops, lieutOF DUBLIN. 377wants, justices of the peace, &c., were ordered to bevigilant and careful after that day, in discovering andapprehending such priests as should remain contraryto the proclamation. "And we doubt not," proceedsthe document, " but that when it shall be consideredwith indifferent judgment, what causes havemoved us to use this providence against the saidpriests, all men will justify us therein ; for to whom isit unknown into what peril our person was like tobe drawn, and our realm into confusion not manymonths since, by a circumstance first conceived bypersons of that sort," (alluding to the plot, which, bythe initiated, was called the Bye ; and, for which twopriests were executed and ambo welled alive ;*) " who,having prevailed with some, had undertaken to drawmultitudes of others to assist the same by the authorityof their persuasions and motives, grounded chieflyupon matter of conscience and religion, which, whenother princes shall duly observe, we assure ourselves,they will no way conceive that this alteration growethfrom any change of disposition now more exasperatethan heretofore, but out of necessary providence toprevent perils otherwise inevitable ; considering thattheir absolute submission to foreign jurisdiction, attheir first taking orders, doth leave so conditional anauthority to kings over their subjects, as the samepower may dispense at pleasure with the straightesthand of loyalty and love between a king and hispeople. Amongst which foreign powers, although weSee Lingered, Hist. Engl. vol. vi. p. 16.378 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.acknowledge ourselves personally so much beholdingto the now Bishop of Rome, for his kind offices andprivate temporal carriage towards us in many things,as we shall be ever ready to requite the same towardshim, (as Bishop of Rome in state and condition of asecular prince,) yet, when we consider the course andclaim of that see, we have no reason to imagine, thatprinces of our religion and profession can expect anyassurance long to continue ; &c."A similar proclamation of the 4th of July, 1605,which de Burgo has preserved, issued from Westminster,directing all Jesuits and priests to leave Irelandbefore the ensuing tenth of December ; and a furtherdenunciation of this devoted hierarchy was fulminatedfrom the palace of Greenwich, on the 10th of June,1606, wherein, after alluding to the celebrated plotof Cates, Guy Fawkes and others, as " the latemost horrible and almost incredible conjuration to blowupus, our children, and all the three estates in parliamentassembled," they, as its alleged instigators,received " the last warning" to depart the realm, onpain to incur the uttermost danger of the laws ; and,adds the king, " we do hereby protest, that this isdone with no other purpose but to avoid the effusionof blood, and, by banishing them presently out of ourdominions, to remove all cause of such severity as weshall otherwise be constrained to use towards theother sort of our people, as long as these seducersshall have opportunity, to betray their consciencesand corrupt their loyalty."In Ireland persecution raged, not only againstthe priests but against the chiefs of the nobles andARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN. 379the people ; and, while on the one hand, Pope Paulthe Fifth, by a brief of the 22nd of September, 1606,prohibited them, however persecuted they might be,from attending Protestant churches, sermons, or service,the king on the other, " sent instructions tothe State for administering the oath of supremacy tothe Catholic lawyers and justices of the peace, andfor putting the laws against recusants in strict execution.Accordingly, of sixteen aldermen and citizensof Dublin, summoned before the privy council, ninewere censured in the Castle-chamber ; six fined each100; the other three in 50 each; and all werecommitted prisoners to the Castle during the pleasureof the court. It was at the same time ordered, thatnone of the citizens should bear offices until they hadconformed"* On this occasion, adds Leland, " allthe old English families of the Pale took the alarm,and boldly remonstrated against the severity of theseproceedings; they denied the legality of the sentence,by which those severities were inflicted ; and urged,that, by the statute of the 2nd of Elizabeth, the crimeof recusancy had its punishment ascertained ; andthat any extension of the penalty was illegal and unconstitutionalThis remonstrance was presented tothe council by an unusual concourse of people ; butthe chief petitioners were confined to the Castle ofDublin, and Sir Patrick Barnewall, their great agent,was by the king s command sent in custody intoEngland"!Curry s Hist. Rev. p. 41.t Leland s Hist, of Ireland, vol. ii. pp. 421-2.380 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.Tyrannical as was this treatment of the Catholiclaity, amidst " the calmest and most universal peacethat was ever known in Ireland," that of their clergywas still more rigorous. A detail of their sufferingswould be an irksome undertaking, and it must sufficeto refer to one instance immediately connected withthe affairs of this province. Robert Labor, a nativeof Ireland, who, about the year 1578, had receivedorders from Doctor Brady, then Roman Catholic Bishopof Gilmore, was, by the Pope, on the continuedabsence of de Oviedo, appointed vicar-general withinthe diocese of Dublin and those of Kildare andFerns. This jurisdiction he exercised fearlessly andopenly, until the period of the latter proclamationbefore alluded to, when, although he, at the hazardof his life, continued to perform the rites and serviceof his Church, prudence suggested frequent changesof his name and place as necessary to his personalsafety. At last, however, he was apprehended inDublin and committed to prison in the Castle. Onhis first examination, taken by the lord deputy himself,he acknowledged that he was a priest, and ordainedby a titular bishop ; that he had accepted thetitle and office of the Pope s vicar-general in thethree dioceses before named, and had exercised spiritualjurisdiction in for o conscience, and in sundryother points he maintained and justified the Pope secclesiastical authority ; but denied his power to excommunicateor depose his Majesty. He was accordinglyindicted on the Act of Supremacy, arraigned,convicted and condemned, and so rested in prisonARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN. 381during the next two terms. He then petitioned thelord deputy that he should be set at liberty, whereuponhe was again examined before Sir Oliver St.John, Sir James Fullerton, and Sir Jeffrey Fenton,the attorney and solicitor-general, when he made aconfession, as Sir John Davis alleges, that he wasnot a lawful vicar-general ; acknowledged that kino-jameswas supreme governor in all causes, ecclesiasticalas well as civil, without any control of the Pope;that the bishops ordained by the king were lawfulbishops ; that no bishop made by the Pope had powerto impugn the acts of his Majesty s bishops ; and,lastly, professed himself willing to obey the king inall his lawful commands, either concerning the functionof priesthood, or any other duty belonging to agood subject. Such at least was the confessionwhich the government of the day would fain haveattributed to him ; but, when his friends and those ofhis religion heard of it, and consequently remonstratedagainst it as an act of apostacy, he protestedto them that he had only (as seems far more probable)acknowledged the king s civil and temporal power,without any confession or admission of his authorityin spiritual causes. This being reported to the lorddeputy, he caused him to be indicted anew, as havingincurred the pain of prasmunire, by exercising episcopaljurisdiction as vicar-general to the Pope and byvirtue of a bull, contrary to the act 16 Eric. II. c. 5,a statute which Sir John Davis, then attorney-generalfor Ireland, very judiciously relied upon as framed inCatholic times of such high antiquity, as could notARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.subject its provisions to the popular clamour that mightbe raised against those of modern innovation. In vaindid Labor plead that he was not within the statute ;first, as he was no suitor for the office of vicar-general,but it was imposed upon him, and he accepted itvirtute obedience only to obey his superiors ; next,as he only exercised the office of vicar-general inforo conscience, and not inforojudicii; and lastly,that certain copies of institutions, dispensations, anddivorces, which were produced against him as evidencesof his exercising the office, were written byhis clerk as precedents, without his privity or direction.At length, " the day being far spent, the courtdemanded of the prisoner if he had any more to sayfor himself? his answer was, that he did willingly renouncethe office of vicar-general, and did humblycrave his Majesty s grace and pardon, and to that endhe desired the court to move the lord deputy to befavourable unto him. Then the jury departed fromthe bar, and returning within half an hour found theprisoner guilty of the contempt whereof he was convicted.Whereupon the solicitor general moved thecourt to proceed to judgment, and Sir DominickMansfield, knight, one of the justices of his Majesty schief place, gave judgment according to the form ofthe statute whereupon the indictment was framed"*The sentence, however, was never executed.In 1807 Pope Paul the Fifth, in considerationSir John Davis s Reports, p. 277.ARCHBISHOPS OF Dublin. 383of the difficulties of access to the sacraments in thiscountry, and the paucity of priests to administerthem, enlarged the time for Easter communion tothe festival of the Ascension, a regulation whichstill prevails. In the same year an anonymous letterwas dropped in the council chamber at Dublin Castle,which Archdall gives at full length in a note inLodge s Peerage, (vol. i. p. 237,) wherein a wildscheme of conspiracy was announced, as designedby the Catholics, without affording a single clew asof names, descriptions, or any other circumstancesto test its veracity, yet the most implicit credit wasvolunteered to the narrative by the governmentparty, the greatest terror was affected, the garrisonof Dublin was reinforced, and the Castle put in aposture of defence. The malevolence of the reportwas soon established, and, during the three succeedingyears, persecution only exhibited itself in threats andrumoured intentions, a circumstance which de Burgoattributes to the king being engaged, during thatinterval, in composing a defence of the oath of supremacyagainst the exposition of the Pope and theRoman Catholic hierarchy. At length, on the 10thof July, 1610, Sir Arthur Chichester, then viceroyof Ireland, issued a proclamation against the practiceof some going to foreign countries, and others sendingtheir children to be educated at the universitiesof the continent ; the prohibition was made an engineof cruel inquiry and infliction, and the charities ofChristian intercourse were again dissolved. In theensuing year, Eugene Matthews was appointed RoseARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.man Catholic Archbishop of this province, after alapse of ten years since its desertion by de Oviedo.EUGENE MATTHEWS.[Succ. 1611. Ob. 1G23.JAt the earliest period, in which any notice canbe discovered of this venerable prelate, he appearsin the station of parish priest of Clogher, fromwhich charge he was elevated to its bishopric onthe 31st of August, 1609, and on the 2nd of May,1611, was translated to this archiepiscopal dignity.It was a crisis of danger, and but one " little month"intervened, when Andrew Knox was transferred fromthe bishopric of Orkney to that of Raphoe, with theavowed object of extinguishing the Catholic faith inIreland. By his immediate advice in council, thosecruel proclamations issued against religion and education,requiring all the Papist clergy to quit thekingdom under pain of death, enjoining that noneshould send his child, relative, or ward, to be educatedin foreign seminaries, and that those, who hadalready sent such, should recall them within oneyear ; prohibiting any Papist from filling the office ofschoolmaster or teacher ; subjecting the harbourersor favourers of a Popish priest to confiscation of theirgoods ; requiring that all persons should attendthe Protestant churches on Sundays and holidays,and that all churches, destroyed during the wars,should be rebuilt at the expense of the Papists, &c. ;*De Burgo, Hib. Dom. p. 618.EUGENE MATTHEWS. 385and all these measures of Draconic severity were directedto be enforced with jealous and arbitrary vigilance.It is a painful reflection, that the spirit ofsuch legislation should have emanated from an ecclesiastic.The Pagan priest of nature would, by thetender precepts of transmigration, have opened thebenevolence of the heart even to the brute creation ;but this Christian prelate would, by the operation ofa callous code, have closed them against his brotherand his neighbour. The factors of persecution riotedwith impunity over the land ; spies traversed thecities, the villages, the fields ; they scrutinized thehabits, opinions, and thoughts of men ; threats andterrors were poured over the devoted people ; but,when the hand of a faction was heaviest upon them,when even the sovereign of their allegiance combinedagainst their liberties, they adhered more tenaciouslyto their ancient faith, and to the priesthood of theirservice and sufferings.In 1613 the statute of Elizabeth, imposing a penaltyof twelve pence on every one absent on Sundaysand holidays from church, was strictly enforced inmany places ; but, on complaint that the fines werenot disbursed to the poor, according to the provisionsof that Act, the Lord Deputy Chichester informed hisMajesty, that, as regarding such moneys as were leviedin the county of Dublin, they were " left in the handsof the Clerk of the Crown by a special order from theLord Deputy and Council, to be employed in repairingof churches and bridges and like charitable uses ;because," he adds, " the poor of the parishes, who2 c886 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.are not yet indicted, are not fit to receive the same?being recusants, and ought to pay the like penalty."At length, in the July of this year, the Catholics ofIreland resolved on sending a deputation, to representto the king their grievances and the conduct of theLord Lieutenant, and they accordingly made arrangementsfor a private collection amongst themselves todefray the expenses of the expedition ; the ViceroyChichester, by proclamation, prohibited any such assessment,yet the deputies proceeded to England,offered at the foot of the throne the supplications ofhumanity, and had apparently a gracious reception.The king appointed four commissioners to visit Irelandand investigate the subject, but their report was,as might be expected, favourable to the Deputy, andall charges against him were dismissed as frivolousand unjustifiable.On the 1st of May, 1614, King James, in hisopening speech to parliament, gave bitter utteranceto his hostility against the Irish Roman Catholics ;and on the 31st of the same month issued his royalproclamation against the " titular" prelates andclergy of Ireland, commanding them to quit the kingdombefore the 30th of the ensuing September,under pain of being cast into a " narrow and stronglyfortified prison," and there dealt with " according tojustice and the nature of their offence"* Notwithstandingthese denunciations, Archbishop Matthews inthe ensuing month presided at a conference, held inDe Burgo.

This canon also enjoinsthe immediate registry of the names of the childrenbaptised, their parents and godfathers and godmothers,the date, &c., and prohibits the exaction ofany dues from the known poor, for administering thisor any other sacrament, under pain of suspension ;5th, for the decorous celebration of " the awfulmystery of the sacrifice of the mass," and in particular,referring to the calamity that compelled theRoman Catholic clergy of the time to celebrate it inunconsecrated spots, and in the open air, this canon2 c 2388 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.directs, that at least a clean place should be selectedwhere the altar might be sheltered from wind andrain, strictly prohibits the introduction of any prayersthat are not in the Missal according to the Rubric,the exaction of alms without the permission of theordinary, the exhibition of relics as in a country wherethey might be irreverently treated, the celebrationof mass or any religious duties by an ecclesiastic in anexternal parish without the leave of the ordinary, andeven restrains the ordinary s discretion therein, prohibitsexorcisms and such superstitious practices, discountenancespatrons at fountains and trees, and directsthe tests of Christian doctrine and faith, onwhich alone persons should be admitted to confession ;6th, for the publicity and registering of marriages,the due qualifications of the contracting parties, andthe prevention of clandestine contracts, or with wardsor minors without the consent of parents or guardians; 7th, for the maintenance of the priests (" inasmuchas the ecclesiastical revenues were in thehands of those opposed to their Church") by collectionsfrom their flock according to their means andwith their consent ; 8th, for the morality of the clergy,their abstaining from mercantile pursuits, worldlytraffic, farming, and especially from intermeddling inthe affairs of the State or political questions ; 9th,for restraining preaching on articles of faith or controversy,by any but those licensed to do so by theirordinary, and after an approved course of theologicalstudies ; 10th, for preventing disputations on mattersof faith, or discussions on religious subjects duringEUGENE MATTHEWS. 389the lighter hours of conviviality ; llth, for the dueobservance of days of fasts or abstinence ; with a numberof other regulations and canons equally creditableto the prelate s benevolence, his prudence, and hisknowledge of human nature.On the occasion of the regal visitation of 1615,the commissioners thus reported, in reference to thisdiocese, " the names of such Jesuits and other eminentpriests as are appointed by the Pope, and do exerciseecclesiastical jurisdiction therein. 5Owen Matthews, Titular Archbishop of Dublin,harboured in Dublin secretly : Hollywood, aJesuit, kept and harboured by Sir Christopher Plun-kept : Everard, brother to Sir John Everard, resortedoften to this city, and secretly is harboured : Lennox,a famous priest, kept by Nicholas Netterville : andTalbot, brother to William Talbot, is lately preferredto be vicar-general of the diocese of Dublin and Kildarefor his brother s constancy in England. 51On the 13th of October, l6l7> a proclamationissued from the Castle of Dublin, for the expulsion ofall the regular clergy, and an individual of the nameof John Boston was commissioned to discover them,,wherever they could be had ; by him several wereaccordingly detected, and some of the nobles, whosheltered them, were also thrown into prison,* whilethe judges were instructed by the Lord Deputy, St.John, to enforce on the ensuing circuits the penaltiesand fines against recusants, who refused toWare s Annals.390 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.attend the Protestant service, the order being subscribed,amongst others of the council, by ArchbishopThomas Jones.The succeeding years of Doctor Matthews s existencegive but the records of a persecution too generalto be appropriated to his memoir. Suffice it to say,he was at length obliged to yield to its advances, andretired in his old age to the Netherlands, where, in1623, the last year of his life, he was instrumentalin founding a Roman Catholic college at Louvain,which received its appointments from the Propagandaat Rome. Immediately previous to this event, LordFalkland was sent Viceroy to Ireland, with the novelcommission to grant liberty of conscience to the Catholics; but so much was he overruled by the feelingsof the Irish faction, who were nourished by theirprivations, that in four months after his arrival hereiterated the proclamation, commanding all Catholicpriests, as well secular as regular, to leave the kingdom; such has been the caprice and selfishness of toomany of those Deputies, to whom the honour of thecrown and the happiness of the people were committed.On the meditated visit of Prince Charles, however,to the court of Spain, this interdict was allowedto slumber.THOMAS FLEMING.[Succ. 1623. Ob. 1666.]Upon the death of Archbishop Matthews, DoctorThomas Fleming, of the family of the barons ofSlane, a Franciscan friar, and for some time a pro-thomasFLEMING. 3 ( J1lessor of theology in Louvain, was, on the 23rd ofOctober, 1 623, at the early age of thirty, deputed tothe ecclesiastical government of this province byPope Urban the Eighth, from whom he thereuponobtained letters apostolic, assuring the protection andpatronage of his Holiness to the colleges foundedon the Continent for the Irish priesthood, and alsootherwise sanctioning and facilitating the mission inIreland.* Paul Harris, a secular of the diocese, tookoccasion to inveigh bitterly against this and otherselections of prelates from the class of the regulars."If any," he says, "desire to know the names andnumbers of our present friar bishops of this kingdom,they be as follow : Thomas Fleming, alias Barnewall,alias White, Archbishop of Dublin, Franciscan ; BoethiusEgan, Bishop of Elphin, Franciscan ; HughMagennis, Bishop of Down, Franciscan ; Ross MacGeoghegan, Bishop of Kildare, Dominican ; PatrickComfort, Bishop of Waterford, Augustinian; whichlast is the only indifferent friar bishop under theclergy, of all that ever yet were sent into this kingdom.Some others we have, who, albeit they wereelected out of the body of the clergy, yet because,standing upon their own feet they were not able toreach the apple of episcopal promotion, they mountedupon the friars shoulders, and by their alone meanshave obtained the same, and for that cause are littlemore loving to the clergy, or less beloved of thefriars than the former."On the accession of Charles the First to theDo Burgo, Hib. Doni, p. 874.392 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.throne, fairer prospects seemed to open for the IrishCatholics, and the royal instructions, directed on the24th of May, 1626, to Lord Falkland for the governmentof Ireland, declared, That his Catholic subjectsof that country are to be admitted to sue their liveries,ouster les mains, and other grants depending inthe court of wards, taking only the oath of allegiance,and any other oath to be forborne in that case ; thatIrish lawyers are to be admitted by the judges theretopractise the law, taking only the said oath, &c.But the true motive, for this apparent relaxation ofhostility to the Catholics, will be found in the royalanxiety to effectuate the proposed gift of 120,000,then sought to be contributed by the Irish, of which,as the proportion of Catholics was at that time, accordingto Sir William Petty, as eleven to two, thelarger part was to be defrayed by them ; the better,therefore, to induce their acquiescence, the king gavehis solemn promise, that, in the next session of parliament,the grievances complained of should be redressed,and the above instructions were accordingly framedas a forerunner of what was called the Graces. Themoney was paid, but the Graces never appeared; andLord Falkland even ventured to indulge his own lineof politics, by issuing a proclamation on the 1st ofApril, 1629, importing, "that the late intermissionof legal proceedings against Popish pretended titulararchbishops, bishops, abbots, deans, vicars-general,Jesuits, friars, and others of that sort, that derivetheir pretended authority and orders from the see ofRome, in contempt of his Majesty s royal power andauthority, had bred such an extraordinary insolenceTHOMAS FLEMING. 393and presumption in them, as he was necessitated tocharge and command them, in his Majesty s name, toforbear the exercise of their Popish rites and ceremonies."The proclamation," adds Cox,* wasbaffled and ridiculed every where. It was read inDrogheda by a drunken soldier in such a ridiculousmanner, that it seemed like a May game, and wasrather sport than terror to the auditors. It was sodespised and contemned by the Popish clergy, thatthey nevertheless exercised full jurisdiction even toexcommunication, and they not only proceeded inbuilding abbeys and monasteries, but had the confidenceto erect a university at Dublin in the face ofthe Government, which, it seems, thought itself limitedin this matter by instructions from England."The lenity, with which Cox would insinuate that thisproclamation was used, is however contradicted bythe occurrences that took place on the attempted suppressionof the house of Carmelite in Cook-street,as detailed in the memoir of Archbishop Berkeley,and, as best expressed in the language of an almostcontemporaneous chronicle. " About this time thearchbishop and mayor of Dublin seized upon severalpriests in that city in the act of massing, their trinketswere taken from them, the images battered anddestroyed, the priests and friars were delivered up tothe soldiers, whom some Papists endeavoured to rescue,but in vain, for, a far stronger power appearingwith the magistrates, they were repelled; twelveHistory of Ireland, vol. ii. p. 53.394 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.Popish aldermen were imprisoned for not assistingthe mayor, and, upon their misbehaviour and mutiny,fifteen houses were seized and forfeited to the king,the friars and priests were ordered to be prosecuted,and two of them, to avoid justice, hanged themselvesin prison ; and yet, notwithstanding all this, somewould have us believe that Popery was connived at,nay tolerated in their times, and that by the governorsand government of that kingdom; but how trulysuch things are said may sufficiently from hence appear"* In the end indeed Lord Falkland s " strictthough legal administration in regard to the Papists,whom the court was inclined to favour, raised theloudest clamours against him from that party, whocaused him to be dismissed from his viceroyalty withsome circumstances of disgracesDuring all these years, the before mentionedPaul Harris, who had conceived such an early prejudiceagainst Doctor Fleming, was unremitting in histirades against him arid the regular clergy, and, in awork which he entitled " Olfactory," was so especiallysevere, and criminatory of the Dominicans, thatthe archbishop felt himself obliged to cause inquiryto be made into the matter, the result of which provingfavourable to the regulars, the prelate publishedhis desire, that, " in order to preserve peace, concord,and Christian charity between the secular and regulars,none of his diocese, clergy or laymen, shouldAnnals of King Charles the First, p. 3/2.t Grainger s Biog.

On this latter ground,he subsequently arraigned his ordinary before theLord Deputy, who gladly availed himself of the opportunityto rebuke the prelate. Harris also chargedthe whole body of the regulars with holding and promulgatingtenets subversive of the secular, andderogatory to their character as a priesthood ; butthese allegations were most satisfactorily denied. AsHarris, however, persevered in his libellous asperseARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.sons, Cardinal Bartering, Prefect of the Propaganda,felt compelled to interfere ; and accordingly,by letter bearing date on the 1st of December, 1634,directed and authorized Doctor Thomas Ease, theRoman Catholic Bishop of Meath, to banish him fromthe diocese of Dublin : the bishop, however, fearful ofthe civil power, declined to act, and the sturdy priestreplied, " Certes, if the Bishop of Heath s warrantcome in the name of King Charles, it will doubtlessbe obeyed, but, if it come in any other man s name,Paul Harris is resolved not to depart, nay, if all thefriars, priests, bishops, cardinals, popes, and a generalcouncil shall command him to depart, he will not removea foot out of the diocese of Dublin. No, no,with the good leave of the State, Paul Harris, nowof the age of 63, hath set up his rest, and is resolvedto say of Ireland, and in particular of this diocese ofDublin, here will he dwell, for that he hath madechoice thereof, till such time as his better part betranslated into a better habitation"* The remainderof this individual s life is involved in the obscuritywhich generally awaits such self-promoted, ephemeralimportance.In reference to the more general state of theCatholics in Ireland, it may be here mentioned, that,previous to the last mentioned transactions, thesubsidies for the government having become burdensometo the Protestants, they represented to his Majesty,that in lieu thereof the statute of ElizabethThe Exile exiled, pp. 3, 11.THOMAS FLEMING. 397should be enforced, and that, by exacting the penaltiesof twelve pence on every Sunday against every recusantabsent from church, a sufficient fund would beobtained for the support of the army. The kingconsented, and the fines were directed to be presented.In 1633, however, on the appointment of Lord Wentworthto the government, he objected to such a modeof assessment. " Not," said he, " but every goodEnglishman ought, as well in reason of State as inconscience, to desire the kingdom were well reducedto a conformity in religion ;*" but, as he afterwardsadds, " if it took that good effect for which it wasintended, it would come to nothing, and so wouldprove a covering narrower than a man could wraphimself in."The immediately ensuing years of Doctor Flemings life appear to have been passed in the unotraded exercise of his ecclesiastical duties, in thinculcation and promotion of which he is discoveredin July, 1640, presiding at a provincial council, whichwas held at Tyrcrogher in the county of Kildare.Its canons, as yet extant, enforced the uniformity ofdiscipline ; the publication of bans on the occasionof marriages ; the discreet concession of dispensationsto the laity, or of faculties to the clergy ; forbadethe marrying of persons, inhabiting other parishes,without the consent of their parish priest or ordinary,and also prohibited the regular clergy from administeringextreme unction, baptism, or solemnizing matrimonywithout the consent of the parish priest.Stratford s State Letters, vol. i. p. 75.3Q8 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.At the close of this year, even the hopes of theCatholics were utterly annihilated " by the appointmentof Sir John Borlase, an uncompromising bigot,and of Sir William Parsons, an implacable enemy toevery thing Irish, to the pre-eminent office of LordsJustices of Island. The selection was in itself anovert declaration of war to extermination ; and thejustices unblushingly verified the fears of the people.They sedulously and successfully opposed anyredress of grievances ; and, as if to fill the cup ofbitterness to overflowing, " a letter was at this timeintercepted, giving an account that a covenantingarmy was ready to come for Ireland, under the commandof General Wesley, to extirpate the RomanCatholics of Ulster, and leave the Scots sole possessorsof the province.

Mr. Pym gave out that they would notleave a priest in Ireland ; and Sir William Parsons tothe like effect, out of a strange weakness or detestablepolicy, positively asserted before many witnesses ata public entertainment in Dublin, that, within atwelvemonth, no Catholic should be seen in Ireland"*Impelled by the more imminent dangers that menacedthem, the Irish of Ulster rose in arms on theCarte s Life of Ormondee, vol. i. p. 235.THOMAS FLEMING. 399memorable 23rd of October, 1641, soon after whichthe Roman Catholics of the Pale, threatened as theywere with a community of destruction, and renderedthe more apprehensive by the total denial of protectionor confidence, were compelled, as in their owndefence, to submit to, and ultimately coalesce with,the insurgents. " The decision of fortune, and theprerogative of victory, have stamped this unsuccessfuleffort with the name of rebellion ; the malignity ofparty has blackened it into a conspiracy to massacrethe Protestants, without distinction of sex or age, ofbirth or condition. The impartiality of history musturge, that, if allegiance and protection are mutualand reciprocal duties, if the maintenance of civil andreligious liberty be obligatory on every individual ofthe State, if self-preservation be a fair motive forresistance, the struggle of the Irish in 1641, for existenceand toleration, was a just and lawful exertion,warranted by the first law of nature and the originalcompact of society"* The author of the learnedand talented work, from which this extract is taken,proceeds in a luminous and graphic style to illustratethe causes that led to this fomented civil war. Itseems here, however, only necessary to adopt his conclusion,which cannot be better conveyed than in hisown words: "Religious rancour has ascribed theinsurrection to the intrigues and influence of theRoman Catholic clergy; Mr. Carte insinuates thecharge, his pride of candour and want of proof conConor s Hist, of the Irish Catholics, p. 33.400 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.fine him to intends and suspicions; the zeal ofmodern writers precipitates them into criminationand invectives against the bishops of this period, notwarranted by a single fact, and disproved by mostauthentic documents ; that foreign influence had noshare in fomenting the insurrection, that the Catholicbishops were not privy to the schemes of the originalpromoters, that they were not admitted to their meetings,appears from Lord Maguire s Narrative, fromCastlehaven s Memoirs, from the silence of OwenO Coolly, the informer. The clergy con tinned passivesharers in the general desolation until March, 1642,when the shocking barbarities of Sir Charles Conteon those of their order, when the eagerness of theEnglish parliament for the blood of the seven priests,when the violation of the laws of nations in draggingtheir fellow-missionaries from the sanctuary of theforeign ambassadors palaces, and the avowed determinationto extirpate their religion and flocks, leftthem no alternative but resistance or resignation to theexterminating sword."Archbishop Fleming could not long remain inactive; and may, indeed, be supposed the most incessantlyprovoked of all the sufferers, as the focus ofintolerance and the artillery of destruction were withinthe heart of his diocese. At the close of December,1641, he received the intelligence of the king sspeech, wherein Charles enjoined his parliament, " byall that was or could be dear to them or him, that,laying aside all disputes, they should go on cheerfullynd speedily for the reducing of Ireland." By pro-thomasFLEMING. 401exclamation of the 1st of January following, the samemonarch denounced these detestable traitors, who hadrobbed, despoiled, massacred, and imprisoned " hisgood subjects of the British nation and Protestants inIreland ;" and required his lord deputy and his lieutenant-general there, " to prosecute the said rebels andtraitors with fire and sword, as persons unworthy ofany mercy or favour." In a few days afterwards, theCommon Council of London petitioned the crown, torelieve the Protestants of Ireland "from the progressof the bloody rebellion, fomented and acted by thePapists and their adherents," a prayer to which hisMajesty cordially responded, while he further assuredboth houses of parliament, that a proclamation shouldissue, requiring all Romish priests to quit the kingdom; and pledged himself " in the word of a king,that if any should be apprehended after that time,he would grant no pardon to any such without consentof his parliament;" even adding, that "he would notrefuse to venture his own person in the war in Ireland,if his parliament should think it convenient forthe reduction of that miserable kingdom." Immediatelyafterwards the Lords and Commons of Englandvoted the confiscation of two millions and a half ofprofitable lands, to be equally taken out of the rebelspossessions in the four provinces of Ireland, and distributedto those who should aid in their reduction,his Majesty fully consenting thereto. This successionof denunciations might have justified ArchbishopFleming, in taking an earlier position in the troubledpolitics of the time; but he felt that was an arena,402 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.which a divine should avoid, as long as there was aneutral spot on which his foot could rest; nor wasit until the memorable parliamentary declaration ofMarch, 1641, effectually excluded even the smallesttendency of royal mercy to his community, that thisarchbishop selected the Reverend Joseph Everard, toappear as his proxy at the synod of the Roman Catholicclergy, which met at Kilkenny in May, 1642.The acts of this remarkable assembly are givenat full by Borlase, in his History of the Irish Insurrection,and may be thus briefly but fairly stated.All its members agreed in declaring the war inIreland to be against sectaries, and chiefly puritans,for the defence of the Catholic religion, the maintenanceof the prerogative and royal rights of theking and queen, the safety of the royal issue, theconservation of the liberties and rights of Ireland,and the defence of their own lives and properties,and therefore, on such information of its objects, declaredit to be just and lawful ; adding, however,that, " if some of the Catholics be found to proceedout of some particular and unjust title, covetousness,cruelty, revenge, or hatred, or any such unlawful privateintentions, they are declared therein grievously tosin, and therefore worthy to be punished and restrainedwith ecclesiastical censures, if, advised thereof,they do not amend." The members furtherdeprecated any credence being given to letters orproclamations published in the king s name, " untilit be known, in a national council by its agents,whether they truly proceed from the king, left toTHOMAS FLEMING. 403his own freedom." They directed that " all Irishpeers, magistrates, and noblemen should be unitedby an oath of association, and denounced sentence ofexcommunication against all, who should forsake theunion or assist the enemy, or who should, " from thebeginning of the present war, invade the possessionsof any Catholic or any Irish Protestant, not adversaryto this cause, or detain any such possessions."They forbade all distinctions and differences " betweenprovinces, cities, towns, or families j" directedthat in every province a council of clergy and laityshould be constituted, and defined its constitution asalso that of the general council ; arranged the modeof " embassage to foreign nations ;" ordered that anexact inventory should be kept in every province, ofthe murders, burnings, and other cruelties committedby the Puritan enemies, with a quotation ofplace, day, cause, manner, and persons, and othercircumstances subscribed by one of public authority, *and that " faithful and sworn messengers should beappointed in every parish" to report same ; prescribedthat the ordinaries of every place, the preachers, confessors,parish priests, and other churchmen, shouldendeavour to see perfect peace and charity observedbetween provinces, counties, cities, and families, as theobligation of this union requireth ;" that goods recoveredfrom the enemy should be restored to theirrightful owners ; that " all those who murder, dismember,or grievously strike, and all thieves, unlawfulspoilers, robbers of any goods, extorted, together withallsuch as favour, receive, or any ways assist them,2 D2404 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.be excommunicated, and so remain" until amendmentand satisfaction. They also recommended thatambassadors should be sent to the Kings of Franceand Spain, to the Emperor and the Pope, "andthose to be of the Church prelates, or one of thenobility, and a lawyer."

Theyhad a president, (Lord Mountgarret,) a speaker, apreacher, a guard of honour, a mint, a press, &c. ;yet, with all this assumption of power and authority,the confederates anxiously laboured, if possible, toeffectuate a cessation of arms. On the 1 9th of Maythey proposed it, again in the month of July, and athird time, before their general convention, in October,(1642,) leaving certainly no doubt of their thenhaving an anxious desire to terminate the horrors ofa war, that had so desolated the country and destroyedthousands of both parties; but all expectations ofpeace and amnesty were banished, by a solemn declarationof the parliament sitting in Dublin, wherein,after reciting "that the religion now professed bythe Church of Rome, which in fundamental points isanti-christian, hath of late years extraordinarily overspreadthis kingdom," and that great dishonour wasplotted and enacted by titular bishops, abbots,Jesuits," &c. 5 both houses agreed in petitioning hisMajesty, that " the laws and statutes of force in thiskingdom against recusants and all others of the Popishpretended religion, in all parts of this kingdomwhere the laws do or may run, and for suppressing406 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.the usurped power and jurisdiction of the see ofRome, and particularly in the city of Dublin, whichis now the city of refuge for most of the distressedand despoiled Protestants of this kingdom," mightbe effectively put in execution ; and that such otherlaws and provisions should be passed, as might givehopeful and comfortable assurance to the suppliantsand their posterity, and to all others of the Protestantreligion, who are or shall be in this kingdom"*Nor was the intention of the governing party inEngland less manifested in a proclamation, purportingto emanate from the king then holding his court atYork, wherein it was avowed that the laws againstPopish recusants should be put in due execution ; thatno Papists should be countenanced in any employmentor trust, and that no Popish recusant, refusing to takethe oaths of allegiance, &c. should be permitted toserve in the army, &c.In such a crisis of affairs, Doctor Fleming felthimself obliged to participate in person in the operationsof the confederates at Kilkenny, and thereuponappointed the celebrated Doctor Edmund Reilly, to fillthe station of vicar-general in his diocese during his absence.This object of his selection had been a parishpriest within that district, subsequently sojourned atLouvain, studying divinity with the Jesuits, and thecanon law under the jurists ; and, on his return, havinga strong recommendation from Father ThomasFleming, eldest son of the Lord Slane, who hadCarte s Ormondee, vol. i. p. 331.THOMAS FLEMING. 407exchanged his barony for a cloister, received the appointmentalluded to, but which he had neither prudencenor ability to sustain. The acts of this periodof his life were all of a violent political tendency ;distrusting the sincerity of Ormondee, he joined inevery uproar against cessation of hostilities and everyreligious cry against peace with the king.Very different was the conduct of his metropolitan,who sat in the supreme council as one of themembers for Leinster. On the 20th of June, 1G43,Archbishop Fleming and the Archbishop of Tuamwere the only two prelates, who signed the commission,authorizing Nicholas Viscount Cranston, SirLucas Dillon, Sir Robert Talbot, and others, to treatwith the Marquis of Ormondee for the cessation ofarms. In the ensuing month the arrival of FatherScarampa, as minister from the Pope, with suppliesof money and ammunition, interposed and asserted thatforeign influence, which ultimately defeated all themeasures of the confederates. Nevertheless, in thefollowing October, Doctor Fleming, with two otherbishops and six laymen, signed a letter to the lordsjustices, ratifying and confirming the articles of cessationconcluded by the commissioners, " hoping, inthe quiet of that time assigned for it, by the benefit ofthe access which his Majesty is graciously pleased toafford us, to free ourselves from those odious calumnieswherewith we have been branded, and to renderourselves worthy of favour by some acceptable service,suiting the expression we have often made, and thereal affections and zeal we have to serve his Majesty ;"408 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.but, complaining bitterly at the same time of the infractionsof the cessation committed by the Scots,who not long since came over in great numbersinto this kingdom, and, by the slaughter of many innocents,without distinction of age or sex, have possessedthemselves of very large territories in theNorth." In July, 1644, he was present at the generalassembly at Kilkenny, when the oath of associationwas agreed upon, whereby every confederateswore to bear true faith and allegiance to the kingand his heirs, to maintain his and their prerogatives, thepower and privileges of the parliament of this realm.,the fundamental laws of Ireland, the free exercise ofthe Roman Catholic faith and religion, and to obeythe orders and decrees of the supreme council.The before mentioned Father Scarampa remained,in the discharge of his commission at Kilkenny, untilNovember, 1645, when John Baptist Rinuccini,Archbishop of Ferme, arrived in Ireland, in the characterof Apostolic Nuncio extraordinary, and, on the12th of that month, presented himself with his credentialsto the confederates there, announcing theobject of his mission, while he protested against theinference that he came to excite the Catholic inhabitantsof this kingdom against their king, and signified" that nothing more agreeable to the supremePontiff could take place, than that the confederates inIreland, having recovered the free exercise of theirreligion, should observe due subjection, service, andreverence to his Serene Majesty, though not a Catholic."The conduct of the emissary was, however,THOMAS FLEMING. 409fatally at variance with this fair and moderate representationof his commission, and, on the first vitaldiscussion, his headstrong, intemperate, and unauthorizedpolicy led to the ruin of the cause he espoused.The cessation of arms, which had been concludedbetween Ormondee and the supreme council, was receivedwith general joy by the confederate nobilityand the greatest and best part of the clergy : but thenuncio and General Owen O Neill, who afterwardsdrew over General Preston to his views, rejected it;the former, because there was no provision made forthe free exercise of the Catholic religion, withoutwhich the confederates, in the nuncio s view of thecase, were engaged by their oath of association neverto conclude a peace ; and the latter, on the same account,and also because no stipulation was made forrestoring him and his numerous followers to theirforfeited lands in Ulster. The nuncio further alleged,that the commissioners, who had concluded thepeace, had not, as they were bound by their instructions,insisted on the repeal of the penal statutesagainst the Roman Catholic religion. The confederates,however, adhered to the cessation, and, withthe leave of Ormondee, sent over seven persons ofrank to his Majesty to treat with him for a permanentpeace. They reached his Majesty on the 23rd ofMarch, 1645, and the king agreed to all the termsproposed by them, except those by which they claimedthe free exercise of their religion, and the quietenjoyment of the ecclesiastical property then actuallypossessed by them. The concession of these would,410 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN 7 .his Majesty observed, irritate all the Protestants inthe three kingdoms against him. He therefore orderedthe commissioners to return to the council andtreat with Ormondee on this point. Soon afterwardsthe Earl of Glamorgan, a Roman Catholic and connectedby his marriage with the house of O Brien,attended at Kilkenny, accredited, as he said, by hisMajesty to treat with the supreme council. On the25th of August, 1645, articles of peace were signedby the earl and the supreme council, containing anexpress stipulation that the Catholics should enjoythe free exercise of their religion, and retain all thechurches then in their possession and the propertybelonging to them. It was intended that this treatyshould be kept a secret, till a more favourable combinationof circumstances would remove the objection toits publication ; but accident brought it to light, andthe monarch then disavowed the powers under whichGlamorgan had professed to act. A new treaty wastherefore entered into with Ormondee. It was signedon the 28th of March, 1646, but appears not to havebeen delivered till the 29th of the following June.(See Carte s Life of Ormondee, vol. i. p. 574.) Itcontained no stipulation for the free exercise of theCatholic religion, or the enjoyment of ecclesiasticalproperty; these were to be the subject of a futurearrangement, and to be allowed in the mean time byconnivance. The Pope himself felt the necessity,which induced the supreme council to submit to suchterms. Discoursing with Mr. Richard Selling, onwhat had passed between his Majesty and the depu-THOMAS FLEMING. 411ties to him from the council, his Holiness observed,that it was not to be wondered at that his Majestyshould think it unsafe to consent to the insertion ofthe contested article, as this would alienate from himso many of his adherents"*The nuncio was nevertheless unchangeable, and,in the full indulgence of his feelings, he assembledat Waterford "such of the Irish bishops and otherecclesiastics as were most under his influence, on pretenceof forming a synod to settle ecclesiasticalmatters ; but with more earnest they took the peaceinto consideration, and, by a public instrument signedby them on the 12th of August, 1646, declared theirdissent therefrom. "f The second signature to thisdocument is that of Archbishop Fleming ; but he issaid to have declared, that, he subscribed it against hisown opinion, and solely in compliance with the earnestwishes of the nuncio ; J and in truth in three daysafterwards, as if desirous to qualify his intention inthat protest, he, conjointly with the Roman CatholicArchbishop of Cashel and the Bishop of Elphin,wrote, in the name of the congregation of the clergy,a letter to the queen, in which they said they dislikedthe peace, because all things were thereby referred tothe pleasure of the king; " to which," add they,we would readily submit, if he were not environedon all sides with the enemies of our religion, and atButler s Historical Memoirs of the Catholics, vol. ii. p. 453, &c.t Butler s Hist. Mem. of the Catholics, vol. ii. p. 456.t O Conor s Hist. Add. Part 1, p. 146.412 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.such a distance from your Majesty." He was thenin the hands of the Scots, a circumstance which mightwell justify the alteration in Doctor Fleming s policy.The nuncio, after this meeting in Waterford, joinedPreston and O Neill, proceeded to Kilkenny ; imprisonedthe leaders of the council ; appointed in itsplace another body, of which himself was to be president; assumed the government of the kingdom ;excommunicated all who were instrumental in concludingthe peace, and alt who should afterwardsadhere to, or promote it ; by all which acts he effectedmore towards the ruin of the cause he espoused, thanthe machinations of its bitterest enemies could accomplish.His wayward conduct divided the confederatesinto two parties, who by quick degreesbecame more exasperated against each other, thanthey were against the common enemy. " I loved thenuncio," says Lynch, (Archdeacon of Tuam, andthe learned author of Cambrensis Versus) " andrevere his memory, but it is most certain, that thefirst cause of our woe and the beginning of our ruinwere produced by his censures. The day, on whichthey were fulminated, should not be in benediction ;to the Irish it was most disastrous, and should thereforebe noticed with black, ranked among the inauspiciousdays, and devoted to the furies."At the close of October, in the same year, (1646,)Rinuccini, in company with Preston and O Neill,and an army of 16,000 foot, and 1600 horse, advancedto Dublin ; and, on the 2nd of November, sent hisproposals of accommodation to the Marquis of Or-thomasFLEMING. 413monde; but his Excellency now firmly refused toagree to them. The Marquis, however, and thecouncil, being doubtful how the Catholics of Dublinmight behave in case the city was assaulted by suchan army, fighting under a title of so specious a causeand under the authority of so extraordinary a ministerof the holy see, put two questions to those of theCatholic clergy who resided in that city. 1st, whether,if the nuncio should proceed to excommunicatethe adherents to the peace then lately made, theexcommunication would be void ; and 2nd, whether,if the city should be besieged by the direction of thenuncio, the Catholics might lawfully resist the siegeor assault. The clergy so applied to answered unanimously,that the excommunication would be voidand the resistance lawful.* His Excellency afterwardsentered into a negotiation with general Preston,but mutual distrust prevented its execution oneither side; upon this the Marquis, with more successas probably more seriousness, treated with the covenanters; the terms were concluded, and Ormondeesoon afterwards gave up to their commissioners allthe forces under his command, the sword of state andthe other insignia of government ; for which serviceshe received, from the usurping powers, a large sum ofmoney and permission to hold his estates dischargedfrom all debts upon them. Mr. Carte," says Mr.Matthew O Conor,f "endeavours to palliate thisCurry s Hist.

About the end of July,1647? by order of the parliament, he departed fromIreland, immediately after which General Prestonwas totally defeated, at Dungan s Hill near Trim, byJones, the parliamentary governor of Dublin, and theflower of the Munster confederates was slaughteredat Knocknaness.Although these calamities made their full impressionon the more temperate of the Catholics, andurged them yet the more to seek peace for theirbleeding country, the nuncio continued outrageousand obstinate in opposing such a measure; and, onthis occasion, he certainly had the full support ofArchbishop Fleming, in whose estimation a peacewith the parliamentary leader differed very essentiallyfrom that, which he would have formerly sanctionedwith Ormondee ; his signature, accordingly, appearsamongst those of the ten Roman Catholic prelates,who, on the 27th of April, 1648, signed a protestagainst the cessation then meditated with Jones, and,on the 2nd of May, five of these ecclesiastics, conjointlywith the Bishops of Dromore and Clonfert,signed another act delegating their power to theNuncio, Archbishop Fleming, and the Bishops ofClogher, Killalla, and Limerick, to do in their absencewhat themselves might do in matters of religion,THOMAS FLEMING. 415particularly in regard of the declaration against thecessation, authorizing them to confirm that instrumentby ecclesiastical censures, ratifying all that theyshould do, and empowering the nuncio to substitutesuch persons as he pleased in place of those thatmight be absent.* About the same time, EdmundReilly, before mentioned, was removed by ArchbishopFleming from the vicar-generalship of this diocese, andthe Rev. Laurence Archbold was appointed thereofSoon afterwards the Earl of Inchiquin, who, till thattime, had been an active partisan of the parliament,being dissatisfied with its proceedings, began to treatwith the confederates. The nuncio, as usual, opposedthe treaty, but it proceeded, and an agreement for acessation of arms and mutual assistance was ultimatelysigned. Rinuccini, thereupon, caused the declarationof the clergy against the old cessation to be affixedto the doors of the Cathedral of Kilkenny, but it wasimmediately pulled down. At this crisis the nunciosummoned Archbishop Fleming and the prelatesof Killala and Limerick to attend him ; they, however,not only declined coming, and recommendedpacific measures, but they further urged, that, LordInchiquin having granted more advantageous termsin the cessation then under consideration, than hadbeen at first suggested or were expected when theoriginal declaration was framed, therefore that declarationshould not be intended as hostile to theconvention now made, but to one formerly representatives Life of Ormondee, vol. ii. p. 33.t Walsh s Remonstrance, p. 608.416 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.ed by the nuncio, as about to be concluded on termsmost disadvantageous to their religion. Failing toobtain the concurrence of this prelate and of theaforesaid bishops, the nuncio substituted other cooperation,according to the power injudiciously conferredupon him, and pronounced an excommunicationagainst all, who adhered to, or favoured the cessationwith Inchiquin, interdicting even the performance ofdivine offices in all cities, towns, or places, that receivedthe treaty. In ten days afterwards the supremecouncil appealed in form against his censures, " andwere supported in that appeal by two archbishops,twelve bishops, and all the secular clergy in theirdioceses; by the whole orders of the Jesuits and Carmilites, many of the Augustinian and Dominicans,above five hundred of the Franciscan order alone, andby the most regular, strict, exemplary, and learnedreligious of these orders, who, by their number, zeal,learning, industry, and pains-taking in preachingand otherwise, quite defeated the nuncio s measuresand worsted his party"* Archbishop Fleming, witha singular vacillation of character, or awe of thenuncio, did not enrol himself amongst these honestremonstrances. On the contrary, De Burgos preservesa letter, which he wrote " from his bed in the conventof St. Francis, Dublin," to the Roman CatholicBishop of Ossory, in which he exhorts and, to the extentof his metropolitan authority, commands him toCarte s Life of Ormondee, vol. ii. p. 34.f Hib. Dominican, p. 897.THOMAS FLEMING. 417enforce Rinuccini s interdict, within the cities andtowns of his diocese.Although the general history of Ireland at thisperiod, unless in necessary connexion with the life ofArchbishop Fleming, is not a legitimate subject forthese pages, yet a few concluding remarks seem necessaryfor the exposition of Rinuccini s calamitouscareer. Ormondee, from the time of his departurefrom Dublin until September, 1648, had remained inFrance. On the 21st of that month he sailed forIreland from Havre, and on the 29th reached Cork.He was received with great demonstrations of joy,and soon after his landing, being then interested inthe re-establishment of the royal authority, he sio-ni-ned to the supreme council sitting at Kilkenny, thathe was arrived with full powers to conclude a peacewith the confederate Catholics, pursuant to the paperdelivered to their agent at St. Germain s, and whichgranted them their own terms. On the receipt of themessage the supreme council invited the Marquis toKilkenny, into which city he made his entry withgreat splendour. On the 17th of January, 1648, apeace between his Majesty and the confederates wasproclaimed, and the English and Irish forces wereplaced under the command of the Marquis. By theterms of the peace it was stipulated, that all the laws,which prevented the free exercise of the Catholicreligion in Ireland, should be repealed, and that theCatholics should not be disturbed in the possessionof their churches and church livings, till his Majesty,upon a full consideration of the decree respecting2 E418 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.them in parliament, should declare his further pleasure.On the following day the assembly drew upseveral articles to be transmitted to the Pope, containingheavy accusations against the nuncio, and intimatedto his Holiness at the same time, the necessityof his immediately repairing to Rome to answerthose articles"* Accordingly, on the ensuing 23rdof February, this emissary bade farewell to a country,which his intemperance had covered with widowsand orphans ruin and rancour. " It shouldbe observed," writes Mr. Charles Butler, "that hisproceedings were contrary to the instructions, whichhe had received from the court of Rome. Bythese he had been directed, in case a peace weremade, to do nothing to indicate that he either approvedor disliked it. Doctor Curry produces reasonswhich render it probable, that the peace made bythe confederates with Ormondee was not displeasingto the Pope, and Mr. Carte mentions, that soon afterhis infraction of the peace the nuncio received areprimand from Rome, for having acted in thisrespect contrary to his instructions. On his returnto that city he was received coldly by the Pope.His Holiness told him he had carried himself rashlyin Ireland,! and exiled him to his diocese, where, byreason of the disastrous result of his miniature, andthe reception which he so met with at Rome, he wasso deeply affected, that in a short time afterwards heButler s Memoirs of the Catholics, vol. ii. p. 459.t Borlase s History of the Rebellion, f. 246.THOMAS FLEMING. 4,19died of grief"* DC Burgo, however, in his uncompromisingaffection and reverence for Rinuccini, willnot admit these reproaches to his memory ; but sayshe died in December, 1G53, and was buried in thecathedral of Ferme.During the greater part of the year 1049 ArchbishopFleming resided in his own dioceses Hisbetter judgment and prudence were no longer overruledby the nuncio s presence, and therefore, whenthe congregation of the prelates of Ireland was held"lonmacnoise on the 4th of December, 1049,Archbishop Fleming was one of those who signedthe declaration there made, of oblivion of all formerdifferences, and of brotherly affection and union forthe future; while, at the same time, in perfect consistencewith his opposition to the peace with Jones,he was of those who subscribed the decree, that amanifesto should issue from them, letting the peopleknow how vain it is to expect from the commonenemy commanded by Cromwell, by authority fromthe rebels of England, any assurance of their religion,lives, or fortunes;" and enjoining amity, asthe clnef means to preserve the nation, against theextirpation and destruction of their religion and fortunesresolved on by the enemy, and manifesttheir detestation against all divisions between eitherprovinces or families, or between old English or old:sh, or any of the English or Scotch adhering toButler s Memoirs of the Catholics, vol. ii. p. 400.t De Burgo, Hib. Dom. p. 489.2 E 2420 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.his Majesty;" with other resolutions of a similar tendency,as given in full in the Vindicate CatholiconHibernia, (p. 270, &c,)The execution of King Charles opened vistas ofyet more gloomy days, nor was the dishearteningprospect brightened, when, " on the invitation of theScottish covenanters, Charles the Second left Breda,and on the 23rd of June, 1650, arrived in Scotland.Before he landed he was obliged to sign both thenational arid the solemn covenant, and in two monthsafterwards he issued a declaration, that he would haveno enemies but the enemies of the covenant, that hedid detest and abhor all Popery, superstition, andidolatry, together with prelacy, resolving not to tolerate,much less to allow, those in any part of his dominions,and to endeavour the extirpation thereof tothe utmost of his power. He pronounced the peacewith the confederates to be null and void, and added,that he was convinced in his conscience of the sinfulnessand unlawfulness of it. The afflicting intelligenceof this conduct of his Majesty soon reached the confederates,and they suspected, not without ground,that the Marquis of Ormondee had advised it"* Inconsequenceof these occurrences, an episcopal meetingwas fixed to be held in August at Jamestown,previous to which, on the 24th of July, Doctor Flemingand the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Tuamgave intimation thereof to the Marquis of Ormondeeby letter, and stated, that, " if his Excellency wouldButler s Memoirs of the Catholics, vol. ii. p. 401.THOMAS FLEMING. 421think fit to send one or more persons to make proposalsfor the safety of the whole nation, they should not wantwillingness to prepare a good answer"* To this invitationthe marquis paid no attention, and, on the 12thof August, 1050, the prelates assembled as appointed,drew up an excommunication against all his adherents,and, on the 23rd of the same month, signed the memorabledeclaration, grounded on the alleged breachof faith of the marquis, during his government subsequentto the peace of 1648, and yet more on theking s disavowal of the peace, published in Scotland,and his declaration, whereby he " acknowledged hissorrow for making peace with the Papists, and recalledall the commissions granted by him in Ireland.The reader, who may be interested in the inquiry,will find in Walsh s Remonstrance much of the historyof this subject; here it must suffice to say, thatthe Roman Catholic Bishop of Ferns, the celebratedNicholas French, signed both the excommunicationand the declaration, as proxy for Archbishop Fleming,although, as Lord Clarendon observes in his " Historyof the Rebellion," " All the sober professors ofthe Catholic religion abhorred those proceedings, asalso those which subsequently took pJacc at Loughrea,and most of the commissioners of trust or the principalnobility remained firm in their particular affectionand duty to the king, and in their submission to theauthority of his lieutenant."On the 5th of October, 1650, this prelate, in peroConor s Hist. Add. Part 2, p. 386.422 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.son at Galway, signed the document authorizing Dr.Nicholas French, Bishop of Ferns, and Hugh Rochford,Esq., to treat and agree with any Catholicprince, state, republic, or person, as they might deemexpedient for the preservation of the Catholic religionand nation, and promising to ratify the same as far asin him and his colleagues lay; but, on the 15th ofNovember following, the Catholic clergy, having metat Loughrea by the appointment of the Marquis ofOrmondee, declared and protested of their own accord,that by their aforesaid excommunication and declarationat Jamestown, they had no other aim butthe preservation of their religion and-people ; andthat they did not purpose making any encroachmentupon his Majesty s authority or the liberty of theirfellow-subjects ; confessing that it did not belongto their jurisdiction so to do." The imbecility,treachery, or apathy of Ormondee, however, precipitatedthe catastrophe of his country s sufferings ;Cromwell and confiscation succeeded, and all thewell known persecutions of the period.In 1652, the English parliament passed an actfor the settlement of Ireland," in which all Jesuits,priests, &c., and a number of noblemen and gentry,therein enumerated, were excepted from pardon forlife or estate, while all persons of the Popish religion,who had resided in Ireland since 1641, and not manifestedtheir constant affection to the commonwealth,were subjected to the forfeiture of their estates to thecommonwealth, two-thirds of the quantity thereof tobe assigned to them in such other part of IrelandTHOMAS FLEMING. 423as should seem fit to the parliament. The proscriptionwas most cordially responded to by the Irishexecutive. The parliamentary commissioners atDublin further published a proclamation, whereinthe act of the 27th of Elizabeth was made of force inIreland, and ordered to be most strictly put in execution.By this act, " every Romish priest discoveredin the country was deemed guilty of rebellion, andsentenced to be hanged until he was dead ; then tohave his head taken off and his body cut in quarters,his bowels to be drawn out and burned, and his headfixed upon a pole in some public place." Thepunishment of those who entertained a priest was,by the same act, confiscation of their goods and chattelsand the ignominious death of the gallows.This edict was thereupon renewed, with the additionalcruelty of making even the private exercise of theRoman catholic religion a capital crime ; and againrepeated in 1657? with the same penalty of confiscationand death to all those who, knowing where apriest was, did not make discovery thereof to the government.Of the strict execution of these barbarousedicts many shocking examples were daily seen amongthese unhappy people, insomuch that, to use the wordsof a contemporary writer and eye witness ; " neitherthe Israelites were more cruelly persecuted byPharaoh ; nor the innocent infants by Herod ; nor theChristians by Nero or any of the other Pagan tyrants,than were the Roman Catholics of Ireland atthat fatal juncture, by these savage commissioners.Morrison s Three, p. 14.424 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN 7 .A Latin manuscript of the year 1653, entitled, " AfflictionCatholicon Hibernia," and yet preservedin the Irish convent of St. Isidore at Rome, thusdescribes the terrors of the visitation in Ireland.The keen eyed vigilance of persecution has driventhe Catholic laity into the country ; and the priestsand monks scarcely presume to sleep even in the housesof their own people ; their life is warfare and earthlymartyrdom ; they breathe as by stealth among thehills or in the woods, and not unfrequently in theabyss of bogs or marshes which their oppressors cannotpenetrate ; yet hither flock congregations ofpoor Catholics, whom they refresh with the consolationof the sacraments, direct with the best advice,instruct in constancy of faith, and confirm in theendurance of the cross of the Lord. These thingshowever, could not be effected without the knowledgeof the heretics, who, in a simultaneous impulse, arehurried through the mountains and the woods, exploringthe retreats of the clergy ; and never wasthe chase of wild beasts more hot and bitter, than therush of the priest-destroyers through the woods ofIreland, many of whom deem it the most gratefulrecreation to run down to the death those beasts ofthe woods, as they term the Catholic clergy."In the midst of these persecutions ArchbishopFleming sunk into the grave, but the evil destiny ofhis country was not to be appeased by such immolations.The annals of Ireland and of the civil wars,unjustly styled " rebellions," that desolated it fromthe days of Archbishop Fleming to those of DeanTHOMAS FLEMING. 425Swift, too sadly evince the truth of this position, andthe remarks of that great genius and patriot, thelatter dignitary, afford the best exordium to this memoir." These insurrections," he remarks, " wherewiththe Irish Catholics are charged, from the beginningof the seventeenth century to the greatEnglish rebellion, were occasioned by many oppressionsthey lay under ; they had no intention to introducea new religion, but to enjoy the liberty ofpursuing the old, the very same which their ancestorsprofessed from the time that Christianity was firstintroduced into this island, which was by Catholics,but whether mingled with corruptions, as some pretend,doth not belong to the question. They had nodesign to change the government ; they never attemptedto fight against, to imprison, or betray, tosell, to bring to a trial, or to murder their king. Theschismatics acted by a spirit directly contrary; theyunited in a solemn league and covenant to alter thewhole system of spiritual government established inall Christian nations, and of apostolic institution, concludingthe tragedy with the murder of the king incold blood; and, upon mature deliberation, at thesame time changing the monarchy into a commonwealth.The Catholics of Ireland in the great rebellionlost their estates for fighting in defence of theirking ; the schismatics, who cut off the father s head,forced the son to fly for his life, and overturned thewhole ancient frame of government, religious andcivil, obtained grants of those very estates which theCatholics lost in defence of the ancient constitution,426 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.many of which estates are at this day possessed by theposterity of those schismatics ; and thus they gainedby their rebellion what the Catholics lost by theirloyalty."Great as were the difficulties in upholding thehierarchy of the Established Church in Ireland, itwas almost utterly impossible that the Iloman Catholiccould be represented. At the close of the year 16GOthere were but three prelates of that faith in Ireland :those of Armagh, Meath, and Gilmore, while this seeand province were under the jurisdiction and controlof James Dempsey, Vicar Apostolic and Capitularyof Kildare. Very soon after his appointment to thisdignity, and at the earliest attainable opportunityafter the Restoration, he was one of those who signedthe document of the 1st of January, 1660, empoweringthe celebrated Father Walsh, on behalf of theCatholic clergy of Ireland, to attend his Majesty intheir names, to congratulate him on his restoration,and to solicit the free exercise of their religion andthe graces promised and confirmed to them in 1648by the Marquis of Ormondee. In the same capacity,Doctor Dempsey was one of the forty-five of the chiefCatholic clergy, who, in 1663, promulgated the declarationof the faculty of Sorbon and other universities,to the effect, that it was not the Roman Catholicdoctrine, that the Pope had any authority in temporalaffairs over King Charles, and that they would opposeany who should assert such power* Such is the moreWalsh s Remonstrance, p, 694.ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN. unfavourableconstruction which the celebrated FatherWalsh would fain put upon an instrument of his own.concocting ; and in which, as well as in the characterdrawn of those who opposed this declaration, the authorof the Life of William the Third, as might beexpected, fully agrees.At this time," writes Harris, " the Roman Catholicsof Ireland were divided into violent parties,distinguished by the name of Remonstrants and Anti-remonstrances; the former were such of the nobility,gentry, and clergy, who had signed a remonstranceor profession of their allegiance to the King, and aresolution to obey him as their only chief governor intemporal matters; the anti-remonstrances were thosewho held, that to give a recognition of their loyaltyto their Sovereign, though in temporal only, was towithdraw something of their spiritual allegiance fromthe Pope ; in which principle they were upheld by thecourt of Rome ; and the Irish titular bishops had expressorders from Cardinal Bartering to support the Anti-remonstrances,even at the hazard of their mitres andlives. They had their rise here in the time of thenuncio, to whom and to Owen O Neill they strictlyadhered, and obstructed not only the peace made in1646 by the Marquis of Ormondee with the confederateCatholics, but that of 1648, and thereby kepttheir country in confusion. After the Restorationthe loyal Irish drew up a formulary of their allegianceto the Crown in express and explicit terms, and empoweredPeter Walsh, a loyal and active Franciscanfriar, to solicit subscriptions to it, which he procured428 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.in some numbers ; but his endeavours, being opposedby the Anti Remonstrants and rigid Papists, weregreatly clogged, and he obtained the consent, or atleast the connivance, of the Duke of Ormondee, thenLord Lieutenant, for calling a national synod of thePopish clergy at Dublin, in order to debate thematter and to come to some satisfactory conclusion.They assembled in June, 1666, but the ministers ofthe Pope interfered to prevent any accommodation,and the synod broke up in confusion"*Mr. Harris s statement is however greatly overchargedwith the colouring of his own prejudices.The remonstrance in truth, as it then stood, containedexpressions offensive to the court of Rome, and repugnantat least to Catholic discipline, and it was thereforerejected at the synod, but not on the principlesmisstated by Harris, nor was the assembly influencedby the Pope against any legitimate declaration ofallegiance, nor did it break up in confusion. " Theremonstrance was rejected as exceptionable in itslanguage, and another substituted in its place, equivalentto the former in every assurance of loyalty,and equally explicit in the constitutional fulness ofcivil principles, to which were added the followingpropositions : 1 . We do hereby declare that it isnot our doctrine, that the Pope hath any authority intemporal affairs over our sovereign lord King Charlesthe Second ; yea, we promise we shall oppose themthat will assert any power, either direct or indirect,Harris s Life of William the Third, p. 99.ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN. 42Qover him in civil or temporal affairs. 2. That it isour doctrine, that our gracious King Charles theSecond is so absolute and independent, that he acknowledgenot, nor hath he in civil and temporalaffairs any power above him under God, and this tobe our constant doctrine, from which we shall neverdecline. 3. That it is our doctrine, that we subjectsowe such natural and just obedience unto our King,that no power under any pretext whatever can eitherdispense with or free us thereof. A protestation ofloyalty, with the aforesaid propositions subjoined,signed by every member of the congregation, wasdelivered to Ormondee by two bishops, delegates fromthe synod, to be presented to his Majesty ; but thisnobleman would receive no other remonstrance, thanthat contrived for his own purposes and advocatedby his creature Walsh ; he consequently ordered thesynod to disperse, and continued during the remainderof his administration an unrelenting persecutorof the clergy. 9 *In reference to Doctor Dempsey s administrationof this province, it remains but to notice, that he helda synod in May, 1665, at Dublin, the principal canonof which provided for the publication of bans threetimes before the celebration of any marriages.O Conor s Hist, of the Irish Catholics, p. 101.430 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.PETER TALBOT.[Succ. 1669. Ob. 1680.]In 1669, Peter Talbot was at length promotedto the ecclesiastical superintendence of this province.He was the son of Sir William Talbot, and brotherof the celebrated Colonel Talbot, whom James theSecond created Earl of Tyrconnell, advanced to theLieutenancy of Ireland, and subsequently yet moreennobled with a Dukedom. The subject of thismemoir was born about the year 1620 ; early inlife he was received into the society of Jesuits inPortugal, and, after studying philosophy and divinityamongst them, was admitted into holy ordersat Rome ; from that city he returned to Portugaland afterwards removed to Antwerp, where heread lectures on moral theology and published " ATreatise of the Nature of Faith and Heresy ; " ACatechism for Politicians, instructing them in DivineFaith and Moral Honesty ; * " The Nullity ofthe Protestant Church and its Clergy, "&c. At thisperiod of his life, he is supposed to have been theperson, who in 1656 reconciled Charles the Second,then at Cologne, to the Catholic religion, and thatprince is reported to have sent him secretly to Madrid,to intimate to the court of Spain his conversion.He incurred, however, the displeasure of that monarch,by having, according to report, attended the funeralof Cromwell as one of the mourners, and joinedLambert in opposing General Monk s declaration.PETER TALBOT. 431The circumstance does not seem verified by anybetter evidence than that of a scandalous pamphletbefore alluded to, wherein it is said, " several of hisMajesty s subjects being in London upon the death ofOliver Cromwell, the usurper, who were more desirousto see his funeral solemnities, than to see himofficiate in his tyrannical government, obtained leaveto be at a friend s house at Westminster, to beholdthe celebration thereof. John King, then Dean ofTuam, a faithful subject of his Majesty, shewed toseveral of the spectators, saying, there goes PeterTalbot amongst the mourners in deep mourning,which had not these spectators seen, they wouldscarcely have believed that it had been he. At thattime, it being the fashion for mourners not to castofftheir mourning cloaks so soon as they do nowadays,he was seen by several to walk in the samehabit, with his cloak folded under his arm, for somemonths after this funeral, walking in the piazzaof Covent Garden, and other of the streets of thecity of London. Upon General Monk s rising inEngland to bring in our now gracious sovereignKing Charles the Second into his throne, this saidPeter Talbot went, in company with the then GeneralLambert, riding to oppose the Duke of Albemarles designs ; for those, his good feats, the Popemade him titular Archbishop of Dublin"* Withoutconceding the more censorious portion of thisnotice, it certainly is rendered more than probableFoxes and Firebrand?, p. 96.432 Archbishops OF DUBLIN.by some memorials of the period, that Talbot hadbeen sent into England by the Pope, on the affairsof the Church during the commonwealth, and thathe then became acquainted with most of the peoplein power, and was even intimate with Cromwell himself,while it is yet more certain, that on the Restorationhe fled the country, and never returned, until,upon the king s marriage with the Infanta of Portugal,he was appointed one of her chaplains, and, hisvows as a Jesuit having been subsequently dispensedwith, he was advanced to the archbishopric of Dublinin 1669, having been consecrated at Antwerp orGhent on the second of May in that year.In the same year he landed at Skerries, as mentionedat that locality in the " History of the Countyof Dublin ;" filled as it would appear, with themost confident hope of another restoration, yetdearer to his heart, that of the freedom, rank, andreverence of the Roman Catholic religion, an objectwhich Harris says, "he was always formingdesigns and contriving schemes for advancing"*As far as those designs and schemes, if they are to becalled such, could be advanced honourably, peaceably,and legitimately, the prelate certainly laboured fortheir consummation ; but how greatly he has beenmisrepresented as " a man of aspiring and restlessspirit," and " a participator of political intrigues,"will best appear from his works.On his arrival in the metropolis, he found anWare s Writers, p. 192.PETER TALBOT. 433assembly of the Catholic clergy there, sitting underthe control of the primate ; Talbot immediately introducedhimself amongst them, announcing that theking had appointed him to oversee them all, " whereuponthe titular primate, Plunket, considering thisan unwarranted assumption, desired to see the authorityon which it was advanced, alleging, that ifthere was in fact such an authority, he would submitto it ; the other answered, that he had not it underthe great seal ; to which Doctor Plunket replied, thatthe little seal would serve his turn, but, until one orother was produced, he would take care to overseeTalbot, and expected to be obeyed. " These arrogantpretensions of Talbot," adds Harris, "obliged Planket to interpose his authority as primate, andto inhibit him to go to England, where, he pretended,his presence was necessary, with the object ofpreventing the success of Peter Walsh s solicitationsto have the remonstrance put in force ; Plunket,otherwise a mild man, made him upon this occasiona sharp answer, that he had good grounds to believethere was no such matter, that he had the reputationof meddling too much in affairs of state, which wascontrary to the canons and orders of the Pope, and forthat reason he inhibited him from going. Talbotwas thereupon obliged to send to the nuncio at Brusselsfor a license of absence, under pretence of beingrequired by his Majesty to attend him in England *This unpleasant collision revived in the Catholicestablishment that primatial question, which had beenWare s Writers, p. 192.2 F434 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.terminated nearly fifty years before in the Protestant.Both archbishops appealed to Rome, where, as allegedby Doctor Plunket, and subsequently by DoctorHugh M Mahon, a decision was made in favour ofArmagh ; and it was further ordained thereupon,that in the office of St. Patrick there should be insertedthe attestation ; " he, with the authority of theRoman pontiff, constituted Armagh the metropolitanof all the island."In the commencement of the following year ArchbishopTalbot sojourned for a short time at Ghent,and in that interval published, in quarto, a Treatise ofReligion and Government, immediately after whichhe returned to Ireland ; and when, in the May of thesame year, (1670), Lord Berkeley was sworn LordLieutenant of Ireland, Archbishop Talbot, immediatelyon his landing, waited upon him, was courteouslyreceived, and permitted to appear in his archiepiscopalcharacter before the council, an indulgencewithout a precedent from the time of the Reformation." The Lord Berkeley," as Harris would warphis motives, " did not care for the man, and was incensedat his impudent pretence to the king s authorityfor overseeing the Irish clergy, but he was afraidof his interest with the Duke of Buckingham, who hadnewly recovered his power at court, and, therefore,thought fit to smother his resentment"* Immediatelyafterwards, the Anti-remonstrances caused provincialcouncils to be held throughout Ireland, andHarris s Ware s Writers, p. 192.PETER TALBOT. 435diocesan synods within most of the sees, the greatbusiness of which was, to strengthen these religiousprinciples, which the Remonstrants would have sacrificedto their loyalty, and to control the proceedingsof the clergy, regular and secular, who had subscribedthat remonstrance. Archbishop Talbot was one ofthe chief promoters of this inquiry and correction,and the most effective, by means of his brother s creditat court ; the Remonstrants of his diocese were, accordingly,removed from their cures, and other pastorssubstituted, until the Duke of Ormondee, who alwaysfavoured the former, having laid the proceedings oftheir opponents before the king, his Majesty especiallyinstructed Lord Berkeley to restrain what he termedthe irregular acts of the persecuting party." Theviceroy was, however, necessarily more conversantwith the true state of affairs, and declined any activeinterference in this commission. " Lord Berkeleywas a man of probity and moderate principles, whosubstituted a mild and merciful administration for theunrelenting tyranny of oppressors; the penal statutesof Elizabeth were relaxed, the public exerciseof the Catholic religion allowed, its professors wereadmitted to all situations of trust and emolument,civil and military, to all franchises and corporations,to the rights and privileges of subjects, protected intheir persons and properties, invested with politicalpower, with shrievalties and magistracies to securethem against oppression and injustice. Under thissystem Ireland began to bloom and prosper, to recoverfrom the miseries of the late war and the2 F 2436 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN,desolation of Cromwell ; arts and manufactures revivere"*On the 30th of August, 1670, Archbishop Talbotheld a synod in Dublin, the acts of which, yet extant,are perfectly innocent of any political tendency. Thefirst and essential canon enforces the catechising ofthe people by their priests on every Sunday and holiday,the others relate purely to matters of ecclesiasticaldiscipline and the reservation of certain cases in confession.In July, 1671, however, a document is allegedby Archbishop King to have been found inColonel Talbot s house, drawn up, as he supposes, bythis prelate. It is given at length in the appendixto "The State of the Protestants of Ireland," (p. 41,c.,) and, if it were in reality his composition, is extremelycreditable to the judgment and diplomacy ofArchbishop Talbot. As, however, it runs to considerablelength, and rather concerns civil than ecclesiasticalrights, it seems sufficient to refer to it on thisoccasion, only stating, that it was just such a manlybut moderate assertion of the rights of the RomanCatholics, as one of their prelates might well seekto effectuate, and as the benign influence of LordBerkeley s administration would reasonably encourage.Had its projected measures been conceded, whata quantity of blood, of treasure, of brotherly love andkindly feeling had been spared to Ireland ? The Catholiclaity were, however, more craving in their demands; they petitioned the king for a review of theAct of Settlement ; but while, by the influence ofO Concur s Hist, of the Irish Catholics, p. 104.PETER TALBOT. 437Ormondee in this country, neither the petitioners northeir counsel would be heard, the English parliamentpresented an address to his Majesty, entreating himto maintain the Acts of Settlement and Explanation ;they likewise besought him to give order, that noPapists should be admitted justices of the peace, sheriffs,coroners, or magistrates in Ireland ; and that alllicenses to Papists for inhabiting within corporationsshould be recalled ; they likewise required, " that allPopish prelates, and others exercising ecclesiasticaljurisdiction by the Pope s authority, particularly PeterTalbot, pretended Archbishop of Dublin, shouldbe commanded to depart from Ireland and all otherhis Majesty s dominions ; that all convents and seminariesshould be dissolved, and all secular priests banished; that Colonel Richard Talbot, assuming thetitle of agent of the Roman Catholics of Ireland,should be dismissed from all command, civil or military,and forbidden access to his Majesty s court; andlastly, that the chief governors of Ireland should havesuch orders and directions as might tend to encouragethe English planters and Protestant interest, andsuppress the disorders of the Irish Papists"* Whereuponthe king declared, that he was resolved to preservethe settlement of Ireland, and not to disturbany thing confirmed by the statutes enacted for thatpurpose.At the close of this year (12th of March, 1671,)Archbishop Talbot held a second synod in Dublin,Leland s Hist, of Ireland, vol. iii. p. 482, &c,438 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.enforcing the publication of bans of marriages, andprohibiting, under pain of excommunication, any Catholic,male or female, from contracting matrimonywith the offspring of Jews, Turks, or Moors ; allianceswhich he further wholly interdicted any priestfrom solemnizing or promoting. At this period ofhis life he published in London, " A Confutation ofthe Principles of the Protestant Religion, as theyare maintained by one Doctor Stillingfleet." Earlyin the following year, the liberal and enlightenedLord Berkeley was removed from the governmentof Ireland, and the bigoted Lord Essex substituted.The alteration was instantaneously evinced ; a stormof persecution burst upon the Catholics, and ArchbishopTalbot was at once marked out for proscription.The willing ear of the viceroy received hisaccusation, by which he was more especially chargedwith having sought, in concert with his brother ColonelTalbot and Sir Nicholas Plunkett, to introduceby sinister means Roman Catholics into the commoncouncil of the corporation of Dublin, Distrusting,as he well might, the impartiality, or even mercy, ofthose who should adjudicate on his merits, he renouncedhis country and his charge, and, after somestudiously concealed wanderings, at length settledhimself in sorrow, but safety, in the metropolis ofFrance; from which city he wrote, on the 2nd of May,1674, such a pastoral letter, addressed to those overwhom he had presided in Ireland, and who could bestestimate its veracity, as must convince the impartialhistorian, that the charges of disaffection and turdusTALBOT. 43 ( Jhence, laid to his account, were but the unwholesomeexhalations of the atmosphere which he sought towarm and brighten.It was addressed " to the Roman Catholics ofIreland, and particularly those of the city and dioceseof Dublin, on the duty and comfort of sufferingsubjects," and is yet extant in print. " I should bevery sorry," he writes, " that there were any justreason to believe, that, since my departure from you,any endeavours have been used to instruct you otherwisethan I have done, as to the inviolable duty andobedience you owe to his Majesty s government andthe laws you live under ; and, though your formerunanimous and humble acquiescence to my constantdoctrine in this particular will not permit me to havethe least doubt of your loyalty and peaceable behaviour,yet, because adversity is a strong temptation,and temporal necessities the most formidable of allmotives to our corrupt nature, I thought fit to armyour souls against all such assaults, by summing upin this epistle the substance of what I have so ofteninculcated unto you by word of mouth in my exhortations.I hope you remember, that I always endeavouredto imprint this great truth lively in yourminds, that the happiness of man consists more inthis present state, in possessing the riches of a goodconscience than the conveniences of this world.Good and bad fortune, as thy call them, are butimproper nicknames and foolish notions, if by thatlanguage be meant riches and temporal prosperity ;they should be of too mean and low a pitch for a440 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.soul sprung from heaven and winged by Christianityto fly at We are apt to missal that persecution,which is a sweet providence of our heavenlyfather To settle you therefore steadily inthe submission you owe to the laws of the land, aswell as in the charity you are by Christ s sweet lawobliged to bear towards your Protestant neighboursand fellow-subjects, I will state your case worse thanreally it is, and suppose you were all driven to thatutmost and worst extremity of begging your bread ;I say, though you were reduced even to that starvingcondition, yet ought you not to endeavour to betterit by plotting or conspiring against his Majesty s government,person, or subjects ; or by disturbing thepeace of the kingdom." After enforcing these sentimentsby argument and texts from the holy writings,he proceeds ; " What I judge most necessary to divertyou from, nay, even to root out of your hearts, is theenvy or hatred, which I fear many entertain againstthose who have succeeded in their late possessions.I confess men are not ordinarily inclined to wish prosperityto others, raised whether justly or unjustly upontheir ruin ; but, if they will have the patience to consider,how common a thing the revolution of times is,and how changeable the best secured fortunes are,much of that animosity, wherewith the devil dothtempt them against their Protestant neighbours, wouldeasily be abated Tell me, I beseech you,what is this world, only a theatre of foolish and falseshows ? a short comedy, or rather indeed a short prologueof everlasting sadness to such as take mostPETER TALBOT. 441delight in it ; a perpetual conflict between life anddeath, sickness and health, fear and hope, joy anddiscontent. Again, what is an inheritance ? a parcelof land whereof our ancestors were masters as long asthey lived ; which term of life, the only interest anyof them could pretend to, is valued but at seven yearspurchase ? Is it reasonable then, think you, to fixyour hearts so unreasonably and passionately uponthat earth, as if your souls were to turn into it aswell as your bodies? Therefore, dearly beloved,I conjure you earnestly, as one who tendersyour salvation as his own, and believes he must renderto God an account for your souls, to bear withpatience this cross which Christ has shared with you.These noble souls, who fix their hopes andthoughts upon Heaven, do from that height lookdown unmoved upon the vicissitudes of sublunary affairsand the storms of subject fortune." . ." Iconjure you most earnestly," he concludes, " that, ifany should endeavour to teach you any doctrine contraryto this which I give here under my hand andam ready to seal with my blood, you will look uponthem as wolves, whatsoever their profession or habitseem to be. You have had experience of somepreachers, who pretend great zeal to God and theking s service, and yet, at the same time, rebellion andmurders were proved against them. These are themen you must not give ear to nor converse with,least you be infected with their doctrine and pervertedby their example. Hear and follow the pastorswho are answerable to God for your souls ; not442 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.mercenary hirelings, to whom the care of them doesriot properly belong ; and yet, if either these, or I,or an angel from Heaven should go about to persuadeyou, that it is lawful to molest your Protestant neighbours,or defraud them of their goods, or enter upontheir possessions by any means or method which thelaw of the land doth not allow, give them no credit,but let them be to you as an anathema ; God of hismercy grant you light to see, strength to bear, anda truly wise Christian prudence to husband, and makethat excellent advantage of your sufferings, whichGod s all-seeing wisdom ordained them for. In thejargon of worldly language they are called misfortunes,but believe me they are the same measures,which the sweetly continuing economy of DivineProvidence ever took to make his servants happy."Such were the sentiments, in which a mind atpeace with itself sought to transfuse its own meeknessand charity amongst the objects of its holy regard ;and who can rise from the perusal of this document,and not vindicate the memory of the amiable DoctorTalbot ? At this period of his life he published, inanswer to the Jus Primatiale of Doctor Plunket, hisPrimates Dubliniensis," in assertion of the precedenceand superiority of his archiepiscopal jurisdiction; a work which, Lerwick admits, " exhibits stronggood sense and liberality. * This assertion of titleon behalf of Dublin was subsequently replied to byHugh Mac Mahon, the Roman Catholic Primate ofArmagh, in the " Jus Primatiale Armachanum,"published in 1728, wherein the subject is most learn-peterTALBOT. 443ely handled, but not so convincingly, as not to elicita rejoinder from the Reverend John Clynch, as moreparticularly mentioned in the memoir of Doctor EdmundByrne. Archbishop Talbot also published, inthe same year and at Paris, " The History of theIconoclasts," " An efficacious Remedy against Atheismand Heresy " The History of Pantheism andPelagianism," and " The Friar disciplined, or Animadversionson Friar Peter Walsh s new RemonstrantReligion."In 1675 he ventured to return to England, wherehe took up his residence at Poole Hall, in Cheshire,in a dangerous and afflicting state of health fromattacks of gravel and strangury. The longing afterhis country increased as he looked upon the sea thatwashed it, and at last, as fearing that the hour of hisdissolution was approaching, he solicited and obtained,by the interest of the Duke of York, a connivance tohis restoration to Ireland, where the unobtrusivenessof his life, as indeed necessitated by the circumstancesunder which he returned and the afflicting state cfhis health, is yet more forcibly evidenced by theutter absence of a single memorial to mark his path.In 1678, however, on the first of September, he wasarrested at Malade, on suspicion of being concernedin what was termed " the Popish plot." Nothingwas found in his papers to justify the accusation, andhis state of health, as alluded to, made it almostimpossible that he could have been concerned in anypublic proceedings. As it seemed impossible to removehim in his state of pain and languor, the ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.city of his brother was accepted for his appearance ;but even this indulgence was a source of dangerousmisrepresentations, and therefore, on the return ofthe Duke of Ormondee to Dublin, Doctor Talbot wasremoved to the Castle, a prisoner on the point ofdeath.Within the walls of his dungeon the groans ofhis country fell heavy on his ear. On the 16th ofOctober, 1678, a proclamation was published, commandingall archbishops, bishops, Jesuits, &c., to quitthe kingdom before the ensuing 20th of November ;and, on that 20th of November, another order waspromulgated, that no Catholic should enter the Castleof Dublin ; and that the markets of Waterford, Limerick,Cork, Drogheda, Galway, Wexford, andYoughal, should be held without and not within thewalls, in contemplation of their exclusion. Proclamationswere also issued, requiring that all Popishsocieties, convents, seminaries, and Popish schoolsshould dissolve and separate themselves under penalties;and, to facilitate the departure of the proscribed,all owners and masters of ships, bound to parts beyondthe sea, were required to give public notice ofthe time of their departure, and to take on board suchecclesiastics as might require to expatriate themselves.All Papists were at the same time forbidden to keepor carry arms, or to meet together at unseasonablehours or in unusual numbers, and rewards wereoffered for the discovery of any persons, " who hadbeen perverted to the Popish religion or heard mass,having previously taken the oaths of allegiance andPETER TALBOT. 445supremacy." The master of every regiment waslikewise enjoined to check the pay of every officer orsoldier, who did not produce a certificate, from thebishop or minister of the place, of his having takenthe sacrament, according to the Church of England,twice every year. On the 2nd of December following,a further and more mandatory circular issuedfrom the Lord Lieutenant and Council, grounded onthe aforesaid proclamation of the 16th of October, andalleging that several of the titular bishops and regularclergy had not obeyed it, therefore commanding alljustices of the peace to make diligent search afterthem, commit them to prison, and return the namesof their receivers and harbourers, that they too mightbe proceeded against according to law. " There is,"says a pamphlet of the day, < ; all the discountenancegiven to mass houses in all places which the laws ofIreland will bear, nor is there licence for any arms givento any but such as need them, and for no more thanis necessary for their security against Tories in theirremote and scattered habitations, and for whose loyaltyand peaceable demeanour the Lord Lieutenantis sufficiently certified by some Protestants of note.The new year did not open with better auspices.On the 26th March, 1679, a proclamation issued, forseizing and committing to prison the respective "Popishpretended parish priests" in Ireland, and transportingthem beyond the seas, unless, within fourteen daysafter any burglary, murder, or robbery committed, thepersons who were guilty should be seized and broughtto justice, and rewards were offered, to the applesARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.benders of every archbishop, bishop, or Jesuit, 10;and of every other commanded to depart, 5, whilePopish services in mass houses, or public places,were strictly prohibited." It was the last interdictof persecution, and fell like a death-blow on the captiveprelate. He pined in his prison scarcely oneyear more, and died in 1680, under all its inflictions.The prejudices of his contemporaries have sought tovilify his memory, and even Mr. Moore has reflectedtheir opinions, when he styles him, " the clever andturbulent Peter Talbot ;" yet the weight of such anauthority must yield in the absence of evidence tosupport it, and the equity of modern times should reversethe invidious judgment of the age in which helived. The picture of this prelate is preserved in theinteresting collection at Malade Castle.PATRICK RUSSELL.[Succ. 1683. Ob. 1692.]After a vacancy of three years, this archiepiscopaldignity was filled by the appointment of Doctor PatrickRussell thereto, an event which took place on the2nd of August, 1683. In July, 1685, he held aprovincial council at Dublin, in which, after reciting,that by reason of past persecutions such assemblieshad been long previously unattainable, and after providingfor the better observance of the festival of St.Laurence O Toole, and that of the Conception, withinthe diocese of Dublin, it was ordained, that anypriest, celebrating a marriage without licence fromPATRICK RUSSELL. 447the ordinary, or the parish priest of the place wherethe contracting parties were resident, should, as wellas the said contracting parties, be excommunicated ;that accurate registries should be kept of baptismsand marriages; that only golden or silver chalicesshould be used at mass ; that, to remove the abusesand irreverence of divine service in the open air,every parish priest should have, within his parish, anoratory or chapelry wherein to celebrate mass ; thatno Catholic should attend the Protestant service, assistas sponsor at their baptisms, or contract marriagethrough their ministers ; that every secular clergymanabout to die, should make his will, and constitute,at least, another secular clergyman of the dioceseone of his executors ; that all Catholics should attendcommunion at Easter, which only the parish priestshall administer; that no priest, secular or regular,should celebrate mass in any private house withoutlicense from the ordinary, c. This council furtherconfirmed the decrees of those held in 1614 by DoctorEugene Matthews, and in 1640 by Doctor Fleming.Besides Doctor Russell, there attended on thisoccasion the Roman Catholic Bishops, Doctors Phelanof Ossory, Wadding of Waterford, Wesley of Kildare,who was also administrator of Leighlin, assisted bydeputies from the chapters of said sees, while DoctorEdward Murphy, afterwards himself Archbishop ofDublin, acted as secretary.In the following year Doctor Russell assisted at asession of the Roman Catholic clergy held in Dublin,at which their primate, Doctor Maguire, presided,448 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.and to which the Earl of Clarendon alludes in a despatchof the 1 5th of May, in that year, directed tothe Earl of Rochester. " This is the day appointedby the titular bishops for a general convention of theirclergy in this city, and there are great numbers ofthem come to town, and of other gentlemen and personsof quality. I am told one of their businesses is,to consider of putting on their habits and of wearingthem about the streets ; but no doubt there are mattersof greater moment to be debated. I believe Ishall have an account of all they do, but, what serviceI shall be able to do thereby, God only knows. Onewould think these people should not venture to executeanything, without first communicating theirresolutions to the king, if they will not make meacquainted with them; though they pretend wonderfulrespect to me, and that they will do nothing withoutfirst communicating to me This general convention,(for so it is publicly called and talked of byall sorts of people in the town,) is to continue for aweek, so that I shall quickly see whether they willgive me any more account of their proceedings thanthey did of their meeting. Methinks I should havean answer from my Lord Sunderland to what I wroteto him on the 27th past, whereby I should know howto guide myself in those matters ; or, if this greatmeeting be by the king s allowance, methinks hislordship might have given me some directions, thoughthey had been to take no notice of it ; for then Ishould have been at ease, and known I had done nofault in not minding what they did. Suppose thePATRICK RUSSELL. 44QProtestant clergy should appoint a general conventionfrom all parts of the kingdom, to be held in this cityor anywhere else, without taking notice to me of it ;I am sure I would not suffer them to meet, and wouldlegally punish them for the attempt, and I believehis Majesty would well approve of my so doing; andcertainly no government will permit any part of theirsubjects to assemble together without the supremeauthority. I would be very glad to know your opinionin these matters ; and whether I should send this information,of which I have here given you the substance,to my lord president, or any others of the proceedingsat this convention, for I have reason to believeI shall have several ; but if I do send them, I mustconceal the names of my informers. The titular Archbishopof Dublin has been with me, he seems to beagood man but is no politician, he is a secular. Iam told by a good hand of their own party, that heand the titular primate do not agree. About two dayssince he asked the primate by what authority thisconvention was called ; to which the other answered,that was not a question to be asked, it should beknown when they were met. The more they differthe better, and it is pity the contests between themmay not be encouraged, but that I must not meddlewith. " 1 This last sentiment was greatly unworthyof Lord Clarendon, but history has been more retentiveof his good qualities.Doctor Russell also presided at a diocesan synodSinger s Correspondence of the Earl of Clarendon, vol. i. p. 387, &c.2 G450 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.held in Dublin, on the 10th of June, 1686, in whichit was decreed, in reference to the parochial clergymenhaving cure of souls, that each should havea schoolmaster in his parish, to instruct the littlechildren thereof in Christian doctrine and goodcourses," and should often inspect such school, andremove the master, if negligent ; that none shouldabsent himself from his cure beyond three nights,without the express license of the ordinary, nor eventhen, without appointing a sufficient curate to act forhim ; that parish priests should take care not to admitany to officiate at their altar, unless licensed inwriting by the ordinary ; that none should frequenttaverns or places of public diversion ; that no regularshould administer the sacrament of the Eucharist tolaymen on Easter Sunday ; that no priest, except aparish priest, or his coadjutor, should celebrate masstwice on Sundays or holidays, except on the feast ofthe Nativity, or at all in private houses, without licensefrom the ordinary ; that no clergyman should solemnizefuneral rites, without the permission of the parishpriest or at his request, nor assist at the office of thedead, unless vested in the surplice or alb ; that thereshould be three examiners in Dublin, on whose consciencesit shall rest to sift the qualifications of anybefore being admitted to holy orders, and truly totestify thereof ; that none should be admitted to suchorders without examination, and, even after admission,that all having cure of souls may be recalled tofurther examination at the will of the ordinary ; thatnone should be appointed coadjutor to a parish priestPATRICK RUSSELL. 451without license from the ordinary, and a previousexamination of his fitness ; that, in case the parishpriest should become unable to fulfil his duties bysickness, old age, or otherwise, the ordinary mayoblige him to have a coadjutor, and appoint his salary; that no parish priest or other clergyman, havingcure of souls, should exact more stipend or dues fromhis parishioners than had been of customary payment;that none should unbecomingly solicit the obtainingor retaining of any benefice ; that religious persons,sent into the country with license of their superiorsto beg alms, should be permitted by the parish prieststo do so, and this even from their altars, as matter ofgrace not of right, until prohibited by the ordinary ;that all clergymen should endeavour to prevent orpunish the abuses of wakes, and to instruct the people,that such wakes were instituted for the good of thedeceased, the performance of Christian rites, prayersfor the repose of his soul, and affectionate remembrancesof his past existence ; that every clergyman,having the cure of souls, should diligently exhort hisflock to strengthen themselves and their children withthe sacrament of confirmation, and teach them " hownecessary it is to receive it in this wretched country,where persecution so reiterates the perils of lapsefrom the faith ;" that the bans of marriages should beproclaimed three times; that no priest should citeanother, under pretext of any suit or controversy, beforethe civil authorities, but only before the ordinary,and that no layman ought to bring a priest to trial,or summon him before the civil authorities, until he2 G 2452 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.first submits the cause to the ordinary; that no regularshould administer parochial duties, unless withthe license of the parish priest, or in unavoidable necessityarising from his absence and that of his coadjutor,"&c.On the 4th of April, 1687? King James issuedfrom Whitehall his first delusive and despotic edictfor religious toleration, by an arbitrary dispensingwith the existing laws; a document, undoubtedly,most amiable in its details, but as ill judged as itwas ill exercised. " There is nothing now that we soearnestly desire," says the royal ordinance, " as toestablish our government on such a foundation as maymake our subjects happy, and unite them to us byinclination, as well as duty, which we think can bedone by no means so effectually, as by granting tothem the free exercise of their religion for the timeto come, and add that to the perfect enjoyment oftheir property, which has never in any case been invadedby us since our coming to the crown, which,being the two things men value most, shall ever bepreserved in our kingdom during our reign overthem, as the truest methods of their peace and ourglory. We cannot but heartily wish, as it will easilybe believed, that all the people of our dominionswere members of the Catholic Church ; yet, we humblythank Almighty God, it is, and hath of long timebeen, our constant sense and opinion, which upondivers occasions we have declared, that conscienceought not to be restrained, nor people forced inmatters of mere religion. It has ever been directlyPATRICK RUSSELL. 453contrary to our inclination, as we think it is to theinterest of government, which it destroys by spoilingtrade, depopulating countries, and discouragingstrangers ; and finally, that it never obtained the endfor which it was employed, and in this we are the moreconfirmed by the reflections we have made upon theconduct of the four last reigns ; for, after all the frequentand pressing endeavours, that were used in eachof them to reduce this kingdom to an exact conformityin religion, it is visible the success has not answeredthe design, and that the difficulty is invincible. We,therefore, . in the first place, do declare, that wewill protect and maintain our archbishops, bishops,and clergy, and all other our subjects of the Churchof England, in the free exercise of their religion asby law established, and in the quiet and full enjoymentof all their possessions, without any molestationor disturbance whatsoever. We do likewise declare,that it is our royal will and pleasure, that from henceforththe execution of all and all manner of penallaws in matters ecclesiastical, for not coming tochurch, or not receiving the sacrament, or for anyother non-conformity to the religion established, or foror by reason of the exercise of religion in any mannerwhatsoever, be immediately suspended, and the furtherexecution of the said penal laws, and every of them ishereby suspended And that none of oursubjects may for the future be under any discouragementor disability, who are otherwise well inclinedand fit to serve us, by reason of some oaths or tests,that have been usually administered on such occasions,454 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.we do hereby further declare, that it is our royal willand pleasure, that the oaths, commonly called theoaths of supremacy and allegiance, and also the severaltests and declarations, mentioned in the acts ofparliament made in the 25th and 30th years of thereign of our late royal brother, King Charles the Second,shall not at any time hereafter be required tobe taken, declared, or subscribed, c. . . . And we dohereby give our ample pardon to all non-conformists,recusants, and other our loving subjects, for all crimesand things by them committed or done, contrary tothe penal laws formerly made relating to religionand the profession or exercise thereof. And,although the freedom and assurance, we have herebygiven in relation to religion and property, might besufficient to remove from the minds of our lovingsubjects all fears and jealousies in relation to either,yet, we have thought fit further to declare, that wewill maintain them in all their properties and possessionsas well of church and abbey lands, as in anyother their lands and properties whatsoever."Every feeling, that dictated this arbitrary proclamation,was identified in the administration of theno less injudicious individual, to whom the feeblemonarch resigned the honour of his crown and thewelfare of his people. The peaceful course ofArchbishop Russell s life was not, however, to bediverted from its legitimate channel, or hurried intoany precipitate displays, by the impulse thus given tothe followers of his faith. He continued by synods,and councils, and visitations, to inculcate humilityPATRICK RUSSELL. 455and attention in his clergy, and virtue and loyalty intheir flocks. In 1688 (9th of May) he presided ata synod held in Dublin, wherein, after reciting theincreasing poverty and want of his parochial clergy,it was decreed, that every parish priest, who wished,might on four days in the year publicly from hisaltar seek alms for his support, beyond what hehad theretofore received from his parishioners, andcontinue to do so, until God of his infinite mercywould provide more abundantly for them ; he alsoenjoined, that all persons in sickness or infirmityshould call in their parish priest, within four days orsooner from the commencement of such visitation,for the purpose of receiving the rites of the Church,&c. On the first of August, in the same year, he helda provincial council, wherein, after reciting that thecouncil of Trent enjoined such assemblies triennially,and that the times then permitted this wholesomeregulation, it was declared to be thus commenced,for the service of the Church, the inculcating goodmorals, and the correcting bad ; and it was decreedthat it was the duty of the parish priest to administerall parochial sacraments to soldiers quarteredwithin their precincts, unless the chaplains of theregiment could prove some special privilege to thecontrary ; that every parish priest should, under painof suspension, on the Lord s day explain some pointof the Christian doctrine, or give a short exhortationto the people after the gospel ; and that the constitutionsof the councils of 1614, 1640, and 1685, shouldbe and were thereby confirmed. On the 24th of456 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.April, in the following year, he held a synod of hisdiocese, wherein clergymen having cure of souls wereprohibited from being sureties for any one beyond40^., without the license of the ordinary ; the use offishat collations on fast days was forbidden, and otherformer regulations relative to days of fast or abstinencewere confirmed.During King James s residence in the Irish metropolis,Doctor Russell enjoyed the distinction ofperforming the service and rites of his Church in theroyal presence ; if indeed the minister of any form ofChristian worship, but particularly of the RomanCatholic, where the service is a sacrifice the mostawful, can be influenced by the pride of earth, or thepresence of mortal pre-eminence, while he offers upthe homage of the creature to the God of all. Thelast rite, which he celebrated before the king, was theconsecration of the Benedictine nunnery in Channel-row.On the downfal of the Stuart dynasty he fledto Paris, whence, however, he returned to close hislife in the land of his ministry. At the terminationof the year 1692 he paid the debt of nature, and wasburied in the ancient church of Lusk, as mentionedat that locality in " The History of the County ofDublin." The event is there, however, erroneouslyreferred to 1689. Doctor Russell s principal residencewas in the old chapel house at Francis-street,where an ancient censer is still preserved, exhibitingthe inscription, " Orate pro Patricii Russell, ArchiepiscopalDublinise, Primate Hibernia, et pro ejusPETER CUEAGH. 457fratre Jacob Russell, Decano Dubliniae, et Protho-notary Apostolic, qui me fieri fecit."PETER CREAGH.[Succ. 1693. ]A short sketch of the period, in which DoctorCreagh filled this dignity, will sufficiently accountfor the utter obscurity in which his acts and life areconcealed; and indeed the same continuing state ofthings must excuse the paucity of materials for thegeneral biography of his immediate successors. Thesubject of the present notice, in his origin and familyconnexions, it would seem probable, was a relative ofSir Michael Creagh, who was Lord Mayor of Dublinin 1688, and who had another brother Mayor ofNewcastle, also knighted by King James. The lattererected a brazen statue of that king at Newcastle,which was pulled down by the populace and throwninto the river; but, being subsequently found, was convertedinto bells for All-saints Church. It is knownthat Doctor Creagh presided over the see of Corkfor several years previous to 1686, about whichperiod he was translated to the archdiocese of Tuam.On the flight of King James, and the surrender ofLimerick, he left the country, and resided in Parisuntil on the 9th of March, 1 693, he was further promotedto this dignity.Persecution was not allowed to slumber ; in 1695,the more than gothic acts were revived, that prohibitedthe foreign or domestic education of Catholics ; other458 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.penal enactments of great severity succeeded, and in1697, " all the Popish prelates, vicars-general, deans,monks, Jesuits, and all others of their religion, who exercisedecclesiastical jurisdiction in Ireland," were orderedby act of parliament to depart from the kingdombefore the 1st of May, 1698; and in case of theircoming back were subjected to imprisonment andtransportation to foreign parts, whence, if they againreturned, they were to be arraigned as traitors ; bythe same act, it was provided, that none should beburied in any monastery, abbey, or convent, not usedfor the Protestant service. In the same session waspassed the statute preventing the intermarriages ofProtestants with Catholics. In 1698, such was thepersecution of the Catholic clergy, that, accordingto Captain South s account, the number of regularsalone " shipped off" from Ireland in that year were153 from Dublin, 190 from Gal way, 75 from Cork,and 26 from Waterford, making a total of 444.Mr. Matthew O Conor, Lord Taaffe, and someother historians of Ireland, are liberal in extollingthe toleration of King William ; but the author ofthis work, with every disposition to reconcile hiscountrymen to a character, most foully maligned bythose who affect to immortalize his memory, cannotbut think, that, with the evidence of the above penalenactments, his reign cannot be designated tolerant.The one class of writers too much identify his willwith the measures of the ascendancy party, the otherwould only view him in his natural capacity, abstractedfrom those acts, to which, however abhorrentEDMUND BYRNE. 459they might be, he gave the royal assent. Whateverwas the promise of the earlier period of his reign, itwas too soon overcast, and every gleam of favour wasutterly darkened by the succession of Anne. In herreign the provisions of the penal code against Popishbishops, deans, friars, Jesuits, &c., coming into thiskingdom, and against all who should harbour, relieve,or conceal them, were further enforced by the statute2 Anne, c. 3, which was succeeded by the lamentableclauses of the Act to prevent the further growth ofPopery, further confirmed by the Act 8 Anne, c. 3.An invidious and artful measure succeeded, wherebyit was required that an exact account should be takenof all "the Popish clergy" in the island, and registrieswere accordingly opened to ascertain the signaturesand places of their abode. In submissive obedienceto the mandate, 1080 entered the requiredparticulars that but marked them for persecution.Of these, sixteen were parish priests in the city ofDublin, and fifty-four in the county.During all this interval not a single notice ofpublic importance has been discovered in connexionwith Archbishop Creagh, and even the period of hisdeath is only inferentially suggested by the date ofhis successor s appointment.EDMUND BYRNE.[Succ. 1707. ]In 1/07 Doctor Edmund Byrne, who had receivedorders at Seville, was delegated to the ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.serous charge of this province, being then in the fifty-firstyear of his age. Soon after his promotion it wasproposed, under parliamentary sanction, that a publicconvention of Protestant and Catholic prelates anddoctors should be held for two months, to propoundand debate on the disputed articles of faith ; " onwhich occasion," says Mr. Clynch, in his defence ofthis prelate against the primatial authority assertedby Doctor Mac Mahon, as hereafter alluded to,this praiseworthy archbishop alone, of all the Catholicprelates, attended said conferences, and therewithsuch zeal, such wisdom, and such superhumaneloquence, propounded the principles of his religionin the public College of Dublin, that many, illuminatedby the rays of truth, shaking off the yoke ofheresy, sought the harbour of safety in the bosom ofthe Church." The executive, however, were notinfluenced by his reasoning. The policy of KingWilliam, even so far as he was permitted to exerciseit, died with him. Queen Anne was prevailed uponto utterly annihilate the security he had given, torevoke the public faith pledged to the Catholics asthe price of their submission at Limerick, and a millionof loyal subjects were prohibited by the heaviestpenalties from co-operating in the public service.The illustration of these enactments is deplorablyattainable in what ought to immortalize the wisdomof senators the statute books ; it must, however, behere briefly observed, that by virtue of these actsCatholics were interdicted from realizing the profitsof their own industry, under the penalty of forfeitBYRNE. 461ture ; excluded from all leasehold interests for termslonger than thirty-one years ; informers were encouragedto acquire legal benefits by treachery, wherenature or justice could confer none; and, what wasstill more fiendishly aggravating, a son, conformingto the established law, entitled himself to divest hisCatholic father of his inheritance ; and, while on theone hand an annuity of 30 was offered to everyconformist priest, rewards were prescribed for theapprehension of those who maintained their faith ;50 for every archbishop, bishop, vicar-general, &c. ;20 for every priest, regular or secular; and 10for every Popish schoolmaster, tutor, or usher. Theleading act of this code (8 Anne, c. 3) required, thatthe doomed ecclesiastics should take the oath of abjuration,under pain of being transported ; but, evenwith this alternative, only thirty-seven of the 1,080registered clergymen were influenced to take the oath.To the credit of a portion of the Protestant hierarchyit should be mentioned, that Archbishop King andseven other prelates of that faith, with becomingChristian charity, protested against many of thosetyrannous enactments, that sought to enslave theprivilege of thinking, and disorganize the elements ofsociety.In 1712, when Edward Eyre, Mayor of Gal way,was directed to suppress the nunneries in that town,Doctor John Burke, then provincial of the Franciscansin Ireland, of which order the nuns were,obtained permission from Doctor Edmund Byrne,titular Archbishop of Dublin, to admit them into his462 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.diocese, hoping they would be less noticed there, thanin a place upon which government kept so strict aneye as Galway. A few of these unhappy ladies wereaccordingly translated to Dublin, but they had scarcelyreached the city, when the Lords Justices receivedinformation of their arrival, and immediately issuedorders for their apprehension ; in consequence ofwhich several of them were taken in their conventualhabits. A proclamation then issued, dated the 20thof September in that year, to apprehend said JohnBurke, Doctor Byrne, and Doctor Nary, as Popishpriests attempting to exercise ecclesiastical jurisdictioncontrary to the laws of this kingdom, and it wasordered that all the laws in force against the Papistsshould be strictly carried into execution ; such werethe fears and alarm caused by the arrival of a fewweak women in the capital, as if the circumstance hadbeen sufficient to overturn the Government, or toshake the foundations of the Established Church"*On the 7th of August, 1714, in the proclamationannouncing the accession of George the First,it was required " for preventing dangers that mightarise at this juncture from Papists, or other personsdisaffected to his Majesty s government, and for preservingthe public peace of this kingdom ;" that allPapists, theretofore licensed to keep and wear arms,should deliver same and all ammunition to the nextjustice of the peace, and all justices were commandedto seize and take all serviceable horses found in theHardiman s Hist, of Galway, p. 275.EDMUND BYRNE. 463possession of any Papist or suspected person. Thisproclamation was signed by William, Archbishop ofDublin, Welbore Ellis, Bishop of Kildare, P. Savage,&c., &c.In March, 1717? when the Dominican nuns weredriven from Galway, as the Franciscans had beena few years previously, Hugh O Callant, thenprovincial of the former order, obtained a similarpermission from Archbishop Byrne, for their admissioninto his diocese, where in the Septemberfollowing, they founded the convent of Jesus, Mary,and Joseph of Dublin.* It was at this period ofhis prelacy, that Doctor Byrne was involved in acontroversy with his brother prelate of Armagh,Doctor M Mahon, on the ancient primatial rights.The renewal of this difference was occasioned by theformer having divided the long united parishes ofSt. James and St. Catherine, as had been done somefew years before in the Established Church ; the RomanCatholic incumbent thereupon appealed to Dr.M Mahon, whose zeal in the assertion of his ownpre-eminence produced that very learned work, the"Jus Primatiale Armachanum." The matter wasreferred to the College de Propaganda, whose decision,after a litigation of some years, restored theappellant; the subject was, however, again moresolemnly laid before the Pope in council, when theclaim of Archbishop Byrne was supported in argumentby the Rev. John Clynch, one of the clergymenHardiman s Hist, of Galway, p. 277-464 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.of his Grace s diocese. This divine s defence isexceedingly scarce ; the only copy, which the author ofthese memoirs has ever seen, is in manuscript in thecollections of his publisher, Mr. Smith. It alleges,that seven clergymen were necessary for the cure ofsouls in the two parishes of St. Catherine and St.James ; that, on the division, Doctor Byrne had designedthe former for the vicar-general of his diocese,and accordingly it had been so held by Doctor goldingand Doctor Kavanagh successive vicars-general,when the decree of the Propaganda restored the oldincumbent ; and, in reference to the main questionin dispute, the advocate relied, that primatial authorityought to reside in that province which containedthe largest population, the seat of government, andthe constant metropolis of the island ; that Armaghwas comparatively an obscure and remote locality,only respected from its antiquity not its authority ;that the visitations, alleged to have been made inolden time by the prelate of Armagh in other provinces,were confined to Connaught and Munster; andonly exercised there with the view of collecting anecclesiastical assessment called 6 the law of St. Patrick,and which continued to be paid in the nationalreverence for the apostle of Ireland ; that SaintPatrick himself, though the patron of Ireland, neverwas its primate ; that the Archbishop of Dublin wasthe first invested with the pall by Cardinal Paparo ;that the province was previously subject to Canterbury,but, being thereby exempted, became itself assupreme. Clynch also reiterated those letters patentEDWARD MURPHY. 455of Kings John and Edward the Third, and bulls ofGenius the Third, Honorius the Third, Luciusthe Third, Innocents the Third and Fourth, whichhave been before alluded to at their respective dates,and confidently denied the existence of any authenticBull in favour of Armagh. The final decision of theRoman college has not been ascertained, and it butremains to say, that Doctor Byrne died in a few yearsafterwards, leaving the memory of his virtues to be recordedonly in some Irish poems by John O Neachtanand by Hugh Mac Curtin respectively.EDWARD MURPHY.[Succ. 1724. Ob. 1729.]Of the early period of this prelate s life it is recorded,that at the synod before mentioned, as havingbeen held by Archbishop Russell, in July, 1685, EdwardMurphy acted as secretary, as also at that heldby the same prelate, in August, 1688. He was subsequentlyBishop of Kildare, from which see he was,in 1724, translated to the government of this province,which he filled during five years, and died in 1 729.It may be remarked, that, in the year after suchhis promotion, the act was passed to prevent " Popishpriests and degraded clergymen from celebratingmarriages between Protestants, or between a Protestantand a Papist, under penalty of death ; and inthe same session another statute excluded Papistsfrom voting at vestries.2 H4(J6 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.LUKE PAGAN.[Succ. 1729. .]Iii 1 729> Doctor Luke Fagan was translated fromthe diocese of Meath to this see, which he also filledduring about five years, residing in that interval atthe ancient chapel-house in Francis-street ; but, notwithstandingthe spirit of toleration, which greatlypervaded the government of George the Second, thisprelate has not by any public act, civil or ecclesiastical,projected himself to the notice of posterity; while, inreference to the state of Catholicity in his time, it isonly to be remarked, that in 1733, probably the lastof Doctor Fagan s life, the act was passed, 7 Geo. II,c. 6, whereby converts from the Roman Catholicfaith, whose wives were of that persuasion, or whosechildren were educated in it, were prohibited, undersevere penalties, from exercising the office of justicesof the peace.JOHN Vinegar.[Succ. 1734. Ob. 1756.]In 1734 Doctor Linegar was appointed to thisdignity, which he held as unmolested as could be expectedduring the existence of the penal code, untilthe administration of the Duke of Devonshire. Inthe intermediate year, however, of 1739, the act ofKing William, " for disarming the Papists," was furtherenforced, with a remarkable exception of such aswere in Limerick in October, 1691, or had bornearms under a commission from King James, and hadJOHN Vinegar. 4(37submitted previous to the act of William, nor sincerefused to take the oath of allegiance. During theshort viceroyalty of the before mentioned nobleman,the vengeance of the law was again fulminated againstthe Catholic prelacy and priesthood; and, on the28th of February, 1743, a proclamation issued, bywhich all justices of peace were directed to put thepenal laws in force for the detection of Popish prelatesand priests, and, in the same document, large pecuniaryrewards were offered for the seizure and convictionof those proscribed persons, and of any otherswho should dare to conceal them, or receive themhospitably into their houses.*In consequence of this harsh and cruel edict, thechapels were closed, domiciliary visits were made insearch of the fugitive priests, and universal alarm wasdiffused through the country ; yet some zealous ecclesiasticshaving ventured to exercise their ministry inobscure and unfrequented places, on one of theseoccasions, a priest of the name of John Gerald officiatedin the interior of a ruinous habitation in thecity of Dublin. The mass was concluded, the benedictiongiven, and the people had risen to depart,when suddenly the house fell ; Father Gerald andnine of his auditors were killed on the spot, and manymore were severely bruised or maimed. Moved topity by this lamentable event the Lords Justices, whosucceeded the duke, one of whom was the Protestantprimate, Hoadly, effected toleration in the council,De Burgo, Hib. Dom. p. 717.2 H 2468 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.and the chapels were again opened on the 17th ofMarch, 1745, the anniversary of St. Patrick s day.*In 1751 Doctor Linegar received from Romeinstructions, which he was directed to transmit to theArchbishops of Armagh, Cashel, and Tuam, to be byeach of them communicated to their suffragans, andby which the several prelates were exhorted to subdividetoo extensive districts into new parishes, orotherwise to select coadjutors for the parish priestsfor the service of their flocks ; the prelates were alsodirected to reside and enforce residence within theirsees; and in every second year to report, to thenuncio at Brussels, the state of the Catholic religionand of ecclesiastical discipline within their sees.Confessors were forbidden to take alms at theirconfession-boxes ; and parish priests were directed tocause the children of their charge to be taught theircatechism diligently and correctly ; while in referenceto the regular clergy, their superiors wereordered to avoid admitting any to take the religioushabit in Ireland ; as it was desirable that those, whosought such preferment, should assume the habit onlyin monasteries existing in Catholic countries, wherethe noviciates are regulated according to the constitutionsof the Popes ; and should not return to Irelanduntil they finished the course of their studies there,and, in particular, fully acquired the knowledge ofdogmatic and moral theology. Archbishop Linegarlived until the year 1 756. His portrait is preserved;:t the Sienna convent in Drogheda.De Burgo, Hib. Dom. p. 176.RICHARD LINCOLN. 4(j<)RICHARD LINCOLN.[Succ. 1757. Ob. 1762.]Doctor Lincoln was appointed to succeed DoctorLinegar, in J 757 ; in the October of which year,he caused an exhortation to be read from the altars ofall the chapels in his diocese, inviting the RomanCatholics to be thankful to those, who, without distinctionof persons, had preserved them by theirbenevolence and charity in the then recent visitationof famine ; and " especially to be most earnest intheir thanks to the chief governors and magistrates ofthe kingdom, and of the city of Dublin in particular,who on this occasion proved the fathers and savioursof the nation." He further encouraged them to acontinuance of peaceful and Christian dispositions,while he feelingly and forcibly appealed to those ofanother communion as to Catholic loyalty and love.A series of more than sixty years," he said, "spentwith a pious resignation under the hardships of verysevere penal laws, and with the greatest thankfulnessfor the lenity and moderation with which they wereexecuted ever since the accession of the present royalfamily, is certainly a fact which must outweigh, inthe minds of all unblessed persons, any misconceivedopinions of the doctrines and tenets of our holyChurch." The excellent document concluded byurging his flock to abstinence from sin, and the performanceof moral and religious duties.OIn 1759 (1st December), " when a foreign enemy4/0 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.was meditating desperate attempts, to disturb the happinessand interrupt the repose which these kingdomshad so long enjoyed," the Roman Catholics of thisdiocese presented an address to the Duke of Bedford,then viceroy, assuring him that " they were readyand willing, to the utmost of their abilities, to assistin supporting his Majesty s government againstall hostile attempts whatsoever." About this timesome unfortunate disputes arose between ArchbishopLincoln and the regular clergy of his diocese; theformer having felt it necessary to control their facultyof hearing confessions, and to prescribe other mattersof ecclesiastical discipline : in consequence of whichan ordinance issued from Rome in August, 1761,more peremptorily enjoining the manner in whichalone such confessions should be permitted, andotherwise adjusting the disputed points of discipline.*In February, 1762, a yet more benevolent andloyal exhortation, than that of 1757> was read fromthe altars of the different chapels in Dublin, stronglyurging the respective congregations to submissionand allegiance, generously adverting to the greatlenity and indulgence of the new monarch s and hisroyal ancestors government, in reference to thosepenal enactments which had originated before theaccession of the House of Brunswick, and recommendingthe king to their affectionate prayers, " Thatthe God of hosts," it concluded, "may bless his Ma-seeDe Burgo, Hib.

The different clergymen at the sametime exhorted their congregations not to aid, abet,or succour any deserters, nor connive at their deserting;and also recommended, in the most expressiveterms, to all such of their flock as should take hisMajesty s royal advance money, not to quit theircolours upon any account, as they, on behalf of themselvesand the fraternity of their ministry, disavow inthe most solemn manner any such mal-practices ; forthat such of their flock, as should in any way derogatefrom this charge, would incur the anathema of theHoly Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church.*Doctor Lincoln died at the close of the sameyear, and was buried in a family vault in St. James schurch-yard, Dublin.PATRICK FITZSIMON.[Succ. 1763. Ob. 1769.JIn 1763 Patrick Fitzsimon, Dean of Dublin, andParish Priest of St. Audeon s, was appointed to thisdignity, which he filled during six years, but his lifewas so unobtrusive and so purely ecclesiastical, as toleave, even amongst his relatives, no materials of sufficientinterest for a popular memoir. It may, how-seateds Public Gazetteer, Feb. 20, 1/62.47*2 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.ever be noticed, that his prudence and sound judgmentwere pre-eminently evinced on the occasion,when the intemperate Shilling, the Pope s nuncio atBrussels, denounced the test oaths, that were projectedas a security in contemplation of emancipatingthe Catholics of Ireland, and actually directed to DoctorFitzsimon an authoritative remonstrance against it,which he designed for circulation, as a pastoral letter,through the province: the good sense and genuineChristianity of the archbishop, however, suppressedthe rash and uncharitable production. He died inFrancis-street, Dublin, at the advanced age of seventy-six.The Irish parliament, it may be mentioned, in thelast year of this prelate s time issued an order to theseveral archbishops and bishops of the EstablishedChurch to return a list of the several families in theirparishes, distinguishing which were Protestants, andwhich were Papists ; as also a list of the severalreputed Popish priests and friars residing in theirparishes.JOHN CARPENTER.[Succ. 1770. Ob. 1786.]Doctor Carpenter was the son of a respectablemerchant-tailor, who resided in Chancery-lane, Dublin.It is related of him, that he was dumb until theage of seven, when, having strayed away from hishome to a remote part of the city, under the influenceof terror at the crowds that gathered roundhim, and the excitement of the accident, his voiceJOHN CARPENTER. 473was suddenly called into action, and the first soundshe uttered indicated, as might be expected, his father sname and address. Having passed, according to thenecessities of the times, to a foreign university, (Lisbon),for education and degrees, he, on his return tohis native city, was appointed a curate in St. Mary sparish chapel. At this period of his life, the circumstancesof the country precipitated him in a politicalposition, which cannot be better illustrated than inthe following extract of an unpublished work, fromthe pen of Mr. Matthew O Conor, and which he haskindly communicated to the writer of these memoirs.Landed security for money lent and a legal testof loyalty had been long the object of pursuit withthe managers of the concerns of the Irish Catholics.The first would have given them a footing in theland of their birth, and a legislative recognition oftheir loyalty would have furnished irresistible argumentsfor their admission to the privileges of subjects.Doctor Curry and Mr. O Conor had urgedin all their tracts the justice and policy of these measures; and Lord Taaflfe, in his intercourse with meninpower, did not fail to impress them with his usualenergy. In the hope of attaining these objects, heundertook a journey in the winter of 1767 to theIrish metropolis from his residence in Silesia, andapprized the committee in Dublin of his arrival inLondon. I am here, 5 he wrote to Doctor Curry,these ten days, and am sorry to see that we takenothing in hands seriously. Tis a great disappointmentto me that Mr. Carpenter is not here with474 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.some instructions. If we would take our affairs inearnest in hands, I do hope for certain we wouldsucceed ; I would be glad to be in Ireland before theparliament would sit after Christmas; I will haveletters for the Lord Lieutenant ; for, if I can do nothingthis parliament, I can t expect next winter tobe able to make such a long journey. I got no lettersfrom Ireland, which grieves me much. TheDublin committee hailed his lordship s arrival, bysending Mr. Carpenter to aid his exertions and toofficiate as his chaplain and secretary"*The narrative of this mission is supplied in thefollowing letter from Mr. Carpenter in London toDoctor Curry, dated 26th of November, 1767: " Iembarked," he writes, on the 18th instant, I landedthat night at Holyhead, set out next morning in therain for Chester, which I reached after a great dealof fatigue on the 20th, and that same day took postfor London, where I arrived on the 24th. Thoughlate at night I went in quest of my lord, whom Ifound confined with a fit of the gout, and, as the postwas going off, he made me write a few lines to you.After this I had a walk of two miles to my inn, buthave since taken a lodging convenient to his lordship.The great expedition of this journey was expensive,but it was necessary as my lord had beenhere a fortnight. The living here is also more expensivethan I imagined, and for my bare lodging Iam to pay half a guinea a week. In this case I thinkO Conor s MS. Continuation of the History of the Irish Catholics.JOHN CARPENTER. 475the most convenient method of remittance is, to ordersome merchant here to advance me weekly what maybejudged reasonable during my stay here. Hislordship flatters himself that our journey will be productiveof some good. Give my hearty service toMr. O Conor: how many happy evenings have younow an opportunity of spending in the company ofthat great and good man."In another letter of the same correspondence,dated December 19th, 1767, Mr. Carpenter continues:"I have it in express command from hislordship, (Lord Taaffe,) to communicate the steps hehas taken since the 12th. The next day he waitedon your new chancellor, (Lord Clifford,) with whomhe conversed for a considerable time on the affairs ofIreland ; he assured him with his usual plainness andsincerity, that he had quitted his family and friends,and undertaken, at this advanced time of his life, along and toilsome journey, with no other view but toobtain some relief for his poor distressed countrymen.He spoke very freely as well as feelingly of the rigourof the penal laws, and of the refusal given to theElegit, Bill ; and dwelt a good deal upon some facts,to which he happened to be a witness, particularlythe late troubles in the South ; the fatal effects ofthose troubles, and the violent party-rage which hadbeen the cause of them. He concluded with anearnest request, that he (the Chancellor) would useevery possible means of informing himself from JudgeAston, and others, of the true state of the country,before he quitted this kingdom. The substance of476 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.what the Chancellor said during this long conversationwas, that he was fully determined to open hisears to any information necessary for the impartialadministration of justice; that the refusal of grantingany other security to Catholics for money lent, butapersonal and precarious one, was both unreasonableand cruel, and that a mitigation of the rigour ofsome penal laws already seemed to be intended, fromthe late determination of the Chancellor here in thecase of Hobson and Mash. Lord Taaffe was extremelywell pleased with his visit and went directlyto court; here the queen, (who that day made herfirst appearance after lying-in,) took particular noticeof him ; she congratulated him on his recovery fromthe gout ; told him the king had spoken to her ofhim, and continued for some time conversing to himin German. At this time he again met with theChancellor, by whom he was accosted in a veryfriendly manner. From the acquaintance with theChancellor, which he will endeavour to improve, mylord has great expectations. He is now every dayabroad from morning until night, and is determinedto omit no opportunity of engaging the interest ofthe great, while he remains here. Besides the visitshe makes, he regularly attends at the levees of thecourt, and at the assemblies of the several ambassadors,so that I shall hereafter enjoy but very little of hiscompany. This account of his progress here, he stillpositively asserts must not be communicated by youto any one, excepting the three persons he mentionedin a former letter."JOHN CARPENTER. 477After several applications to men in power,"continues Mr. O Conor, whose narrative it wereinjustice to abridge, "Lord Taaffe proceeded toDublin in the following February, where by his exertionsand influence he defeated the Quarterage Bill ;but the times were not yet ripe for a relaxation ofthe code. Lord Townshend, then engaged in the conflictwith the oligarchy, feeling that concessions tothe Catholics would throw the whole body of theProtestants into the hands of that oligarchy, wiselyavoided all measures tending to unite his enemiesand to obstruct his operations ; yet he would oftenhumorously say to Lord Taaffe, that, if his head wereas good as his heart, he would do more service to thebloody minded Papists. The oligarchy were at thisperiod too strong in the long enjoyment of power,and in the rooted aversion of the Protestant part ofthe community to the Catholics, to be shaken by anyother means than by corruption and division. Anysubstantial relief to the body of the people; anyeffort to break in upon the code, would have rallied,round the standard of the great families, every manof weight or consequence in the kingdom, and wouldhave infallibly defeated Lord Townshend s great projectof restoring to the crown its constitutionalprerogative. Lord Taaffe, finding the horizon tooclouded to expect any success during the session of1768, returned to Germany; having obtained theLord Lieutenant s permission to correspond freelywith him on the subject of the Catholics; and having,in his way through London, waited on Lord Frederick478 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.Campbell, the Irish secretary, on Lords Mansfieldand Melbourne, and other ministers, in order to impresson them the policy of relieving the countryfrom the intolerable burthen of the penal code. Inthis great object his whole soul was absorbed; and,though success crowned not his efforts, the readerwill scarce feel less pleasure in perusing, than thewriter in recording, the zealous efforts of a statesmanin his seth year, to relieve the distresses of a people,with whom he was connected by the mere land ofbirth, having neither property nor connexions in hisnative country. His applications in England werelittle attended to. The Irish Catholics were then oftoo little weight to be taken up by contending factions,and considered of too little importance to benoticed in the system of empire"* Their venerablemediator died soon afterwards at his seat in Silesia, inthe fulness of honours and years, an undoubted instanceof a patriot, the sole incentive of whoseactions was his country s good.On the death of Doctor Fitzsimon, the regularsof this province anxiously solicited the translation ofDoctor De Burgo, the celebrated writer of the " HiberniaDominican," from the see of Ossory to thisarchiepiscopal dignity ; but the influence of the Earlof Fingal, Charles O Conor of Badinage, and othersof the Catholic nobility and gentry, and the warmconcurrence of the secular clergy of Dublin, effectedthe promotion of Doctor Carpenter hereto, who wasO Conor s MS. Continuation of the History of the Irish Catholics.JOHN CARPENTER. 479accordingly so presented, as prebendary of Wicklowand curate of St. Mary s, for the approval of thePropaganda, and was consecrated in Liffey-streetchapel, on the 3rd of June, 1770, by the CatholicPrimate, Doctor Blake, assisted by Doctors Keeffe ofKildare, and De Burgo of Ossory. In the parliamentof the year that succeeded Doctor Carpenter s elevation,the long sought measure of securing to RomanCatholics sums advanced by them to Protestants onmortgages of lands was rejected, as it was again in thatof 1/72, and a third time in 1774, by a yet increasingmajority. In November, 1778, "Doctor Carpenter,at the head of seventy of his clergy, andseveral hundred Roman Catholic laity, attended atthe Court of King s Bench in Dublin, and took theoaths prescribed by the late act for the relief of RomanCatholics in that kingdom"*In the session of 1781-2, was passed the act, enablingRoman Catholics to purchase lands or anyinterest therein, except manors, advowsons, and boroughsreturning members to parliament ; and theirclergy, on registering their names and residences,were exempted from any statutable penalties. Byanother statute of the same session, Catholic schoolmasters,being duly licensed by the ordinary, werepermitted to teach children of that persuasion, andCatholic laymen were allowed to be guardians ofsuch children.On the 29th of October, 1786, Doctor CarpenterDoclsley s Annual Register, vol. xxi. p. 208.480 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.closed his mortal career, in the fifty-ninth year of hisage, and was buried in St. Michan s churchyard,Dublin, where a simple slab records his unostentatiousbut zealous services. He was not endowed with anyespecially splendid talents, but more usefully distinguishedfor sound judgment, strong memory, and diligentresearch. His administration was by his pietyand prudence an interval of peace and devotion to hisarduous ecclesiastical duties.JOHN THOMAS TROY.[Succ. 1786. Ob. 1823.]The successor of Doctor Carpenter was born ata seat of the family, situated near Porterstown in thecounty of Dublin. At the early age of fifteen, he leftthis country to prosecute his studies in Rome, wherehe assumed the Dominican habit, and gradually passedfrom grade to grade, until he became rector of St.Clement s in that city. In 1776, on the death ofDoctor de Burgo, Catholic Bishop of Ossory, thePope selected this divine as most worthy to succeedthat illustrious prelate. He was, accordingly, consecratedin the same year at Louvain, on his way homewards,by the Archbishop of Mechlin, assisted bytwo mitred abbots. On arriving in his diocese he revivedthose religious conferences upon cases of conscience,which had been wisely prescribed by the statutesof the Church, but, from necessity, had beendiscontinued for some years, and, to guard againstany confusion or disunion on such occasions, he prc-JOHN THOMAS TROY. 481scribed, that the presidents of each conference shouldtake care, that the subjects of discussion be treatedon with the greatest practical brevity and precision ;and that, in order to elucidate and explain such subjects,the truth should be sought from the holy Scriptures,the decrees of the Popes, the councils, and theconstant and general practice of the Church.In January and October, 1779, he promulgatedvery spirited circulars against the then too prevalentoutrages of the Whiteboys ; and, on the 17th of thelatter month, caused all such persons to be solemnlyexcommunicated in the churches of his diocese. In1781, in consequence of a prosecution instituted atRome by the Catholic clergy of Armagh against theirPrimate, Doctor Blake, on the ground of his nonresidence,Doctor Troy was commissioned to re-establush peace in that province, whereupon he held ameeting in St. Peter s Chapel, Drogheda, which continuedits sittings for several days, and was attendedby the chief clergy of Armagh. In November, 1/84,in consequence of the increased turbulence of theWhiteboys, and their especial resort within the dioceseof Ossory, by reason, as it would seem, of the refugeand hiding-places which its numerous coal-mines afforded,this prelate addressed a circular to his clergy,in which, after referring to his former circulars of1779, he feelingly deplored, that tumult and disordershould exist amidst the dispensations of peace and aplentiful harvest, and that so many, unmindful of theignominious deaths of their former associates, anddeaf to the dictates of reason and the principles of2 i482 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.religion, so often inculcated from the altars of hisdiocese, were yet exerting themselves to renew thosehorrid scenes of slaughter and of bloodshed, whichyears ago had polluted this part of the island ; he denouncedthe blasphemy, by which they had dared tointerpose the sanctity of an oath for an object of conspiracy; and, as his silence on such an occasion mighteither be mistaken by the ignorant, or interpreted inasinister way by the malevolent, he solemnly pronouncedthe oaths, taken by these deluded creatures,bonds of iniquity, unlawful, infamous, and damnable,and of no force to bind ; that such combinations ofiniquity were contrary to the maxims of the Catholicreligion, destructive of the public peace, injurious tothe quiet possessions of private individuals, and intheir nature tending to the subversion of all law andorder; and, finally, that such Roman Catholics astook part in these outrages were scandalous members,cut off from the Church, from the communion ofwhich they had been separated by the sentence ofexcommunication, solemnly pronounced against them,as before mentioned. This well-timed, loyal, andeffective admonition induced an especial letter ofthanks from the Secretary of State.In 1786 Doctor Troy proposed, as subjects for theconferences of his diocese, Natural Law in relation tohuman society with reference to the perverse opinionsof Cumberland, Hobbes, Collins, and others,alike destructive of government and religion ; thedisputants being directed to refute their theory, toshew the necessity of revelation and the sacred writ-johnTHOMAS TROY. 483kings and the traditions preserved in the Church forthe government of man ; and to evince that the lightof reason alone could not effectuate the object. Inthe same year he felt it necessary to prohibit thecelebration of these public festivals, called " patrons"and " May balls," which, although they had originatedin the piety of the faithful, were frequented with aspirit utterly conflicting with devotional exercises,and closed in riot, intemperance, and vice. At thetermination of the year 1786, on the decease ofDoctor Carpenter, he was translated to this archiepiscopaldignity by the Pope; and no selection couldhave elicited more universal joy and congratulationamongst all classes of the people.In the November of the ensuing year (1787) heissued his pastoral directions to his clergy, in whichhe strictly prohibited the future celebration of.mid-night masses, which had theretofore, as in Catholiccountries, ushered in the festival of Christmas, andenjoined that no mass should on that occasion takeplace earlier than six o clock A. M. ; directed thetime within which masses should be commenced, andthat no priest should celebrate two on a retrenchedholyday ; that every parish priest should on Sundaysand holidays read aloud to his congregation, beforeeach mass, the Acts of Faith, Hope, and Charity,with that of Contrition; directed that, whenever indulgenceswere published, those who sought the benefitthereof should be exhorted of the essential requisitesfor such holy hopes, viz. sacramental confession, withallits sincere and unequivocal qualities, penitence,484 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.satisfaction, communion, prayers, almsgiving, &c. ;forbade any priest, regular or secular, from appearingat hunts, races, or public concerts ; ordered that in everydeanery or rural district conferences should be regularlyheld in moral theology once in every month fromApril to October, and in the parishes of the city ofDublin once in every month of the year ; and, to controlprivate and surreptitious marriages, he required thatthe contracting parties should confess and communicate.He enjoined the clergy frequently to catechisethe children of their parishioners, and exhorted thelaity to a regular and solemn observance of Eastercommunion, &c. &c. In 1970 he published a strongpastoral, impressing the solemnity with which " thesacrament of matrimony" should be approached, anddecrying the too prevalent resort to " couple-beggars" and degraded ministers; and on the 15th ofMarch, 179*2, he and the clergy of his diocese signeda declaration, solemnly disavowing, and condemning aswicked and impious the opinions, that princes excommunicatedby the Pope and council, or by any ecclesiasticalauthority whatsoever, might be thereupondeposed or murdered ; that any ecclesiastical powercould dissolve subjects from their allegiance ; that itis lawful to murder or injure any person, under thepretence of his being an heretic; that an act in itselfunjust, immoral, or wicked, can be justified underpretence of being done for the good of the Church orinobedience to any ecclesiastical power; that no faithis to be kept with heretics, or that the Pope has orought to have any temporal or civil jurisdictionJOHN THOMAS TttOY. 485within this realm, &c. This disavowal of opinions,most falsely but too prevalently attributed to Catholics,induced the Act of the same session, wherebypersons of that persuasion were permitted to followthe professions of barristers and attorneys, and marriagesbetween them and Protestants were legalized,provided they were celebrated by clergymen of theEstablished Church; concessions, which were speedilyfollowed by far more important immunities and relaxationsfor the long persecuted Catholics.In 1793 Doctor Troy published Pastoral Instructionson the Duties of Christian Citizens, a workwhich was too rashly impugned as favouring republicanism; whereas the sole object, for which that formof government was mentioned in the pamphlet, wasto meet the objection too frequently urged, that thetenets of the Roman Catholic religion favour arbitrarygovernment, and the consequent deduction thatits professors were unfit to exercise privileges undera free constitution. This Doctor Troy refuted byreference to the republics which were established andgoverned by Roman Catholics; but in no instancedid he institute the slightest comparison between thedifferent forms of government. The whole scope ofthe work was to evince, that Roman Catholics, adheringto the principles of their Church, are loyal anddutiful subjects; because their religion enjoins obedienceto constituted authority, to the power that isestablished under any form of government. In nocountries has that allegiance to hereditary monarchybeen more effectively tried and proved than in Great486 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.Britain and Ireland, or such sacrifices made by Catholicsto restore it when dethroned, and to preserve it whenrestored. Indeed the character and writings of thisprelate, " the steady loyalist," as even Dr. Duigenanstyled him, should have been a guarantee againstsuch an interpretation of any production of his. Inaccordance with that character, in the troubled periodof 1798, he denounced sentence of excommunicationagainst any of his faith and within his diocese, whowould rise in arms against the government, and inconsequencethereof a conspiracy was plotted againsthis life, from which he narrowly escaped.In 1814 a contest arose between this prelate andthe grand jury of the city of Dublin, relative to theCatholic chaplaincy of the gaol of Newgate. Thegrand jury having appointed one, Doctor Troy suspendedhim on the ground of incompetency ; theformer appealed to the Court of King s Bench, andwere informed by the Chief Justice, that, if the personthey had selected was not to be found at his post,they must proceed to nominate another, and so onuntil the office was substantially filled. The grandjury, however, chose to adopt a different course, andsent an order to the prison, that no other Catholicclergyman should be admitted except him whomDoctor Troy had suspended. A disgraceful andprotracted strife ensued, and the grand jury, in themean time, under the shield of a lingering penal enactment,maintained a suspended clergyman in anoffice which his legitimate pastor declared him unfitto fill. In April, 1815, Doctor Troy laid the foundTHOMAS TROY. 487dation stone of his metropolitan church, but livednot to witness its completion. On the llth of May,1823, he departed this life in the seth year of hisage, and was buried, the first corse, in the vaults ofthe temple he had founded ; while the first mass celebratedwithin its walls was for the repose of his soul.He was a truly learned and zealous pastor, attachedto the honour of his God and his Church and theHoly See, a lover and promoter of the most pureChristian morality, vigilant in the discharge of hisduty, and devotedly solicitous, not only for the spiritualgood of those consigned to his charge, but alsofor the public quiet of the State ; and with all this,so unassuming and meek was he, that the humblestchild of his diocese would approach him with confidenceand love ; but it is needless to dwell upon acharacter so vividly impressed upon the hearts of thepeople ; and, even if the recollections of his virtueswere fading from their memories, the presence of hissuccessor would recal and refresh their brightesttraits. Doctor Troy in truth bequeathed to his province,in the person of that successor, whom himselfhad selected as his coadjutor fourteen years previousto his decease, a living and speaking monument ofall that he had practised as a Christian, or enforcedas a Bishop, during his long and happy governmentof this province.488 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.DANIEL MURRAY.[Succ. 1823. Vivens 1838.]Doctor Murray was born on the 18th of April,1 768, at Sheepwalk, in the parish of Recross andcounty of Wicklow. At the age of sixteen he wassent to Salamanca, where he studied for some years.On his return to Ireland, he was appointed a curatein the parish of St. Paul, Dublin, whence he wasshortly afterwards changed to that of Arklow. Herehe continued until the outrages of 1798 compelledhim to seek refuge in the metropolis, where he wassoon afterwards attached to St. Andrew s parish, andthence, after a short interval, removed to St. Mary s.In 1805, on the consecration of Doctor Ryan to thecoadjutorship of Ferns, he was named prebendary ofWicklow and parish priest of Clontarf, but he declinedthe latter preferment. On the 30th of June,1809? at the instance of his illustrious predecessor, hewas, as before suggested, appointed Archbishop ofHierapolis and coadjutor of Dublin, and consecratedas such in Liffey street Chapel on the 30th of Novemberin this year, Doctor Troy officiating as consecrated,and Doctors Delany and Ryan as assistants.On the 16th of January in the following year, after asojourn of several months in the French capital, withthe object of soliciting restitution of the property belongingto the religious establishments of Irish Catholicsin that country, he had the satisfaction to obtainan ordinance, whereby, " in consequence of theremonstrance of the Archbishops and Bishops of Ire-danielMURRAY. 489land, relative to the superintendence which they havea right to exercise over the application of the propertybelonging to their houses, and taking into considerationthe wish expressed by those prelates, theSieur Ferris was ordered to resign the functions ofadministrator-general of the Irish colleges in France,and to deliver up to his successor, the moneys, deeds,moveables, and effects, belonging to those establishments;" and the late Reverend Paul Long was thereuponnominated administrator-general of all the Irishestablishments in France.On the death of Doctor Troy in 1823, DoctorMurray succeeded to the archbishopric, and in 1825was one of the prelates who drew up the pastoral instructionsto the clergy and laity of Ireland, exhortingthe former to the fulfilment of all their obligations ;the steadfast maintenance of an exemplary life, " theexemplary life of a pastor preaches more eloquentlyto his parishioners than all his sermons or exhortations;" the vigilant administration of the holy sacraments; " nothing can excuse you from the dischargeof this duty; nothing can exempt you; not labour,not fatigue, nor watching, nor hunger, nor thirst, norheat, nor cold ; you can have no just cause of delay,when pressed on by an obligation so strict and so important;" zeal in promoting the honour and love ofGod, but, " in order that zeal be efficient and producefruit, it must be governed and directed by prudenceand charity, that charity which is benign, andbears all, and suffers all;" vigilance in the moralinstruction of children, " because, on their religious2 K490 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.education depends not only their own happiness, butalso that of the Church and of the State ; labour forthem, as you have hitherto done, through good reportand evil report, seeking aid to assist you in thegodly work of their education, when you can obtainit without a compromise of their most precious faith,or of that salutary discipline which surrounds and protectsit as the walls and ramparts do a city. Turn awayfrom them every insidious wile of the deceiver orthe deceived ; and, whilst you study to have peacewith all men, do not forget, that you are watchmenon the towers of the city of God to detect the ambuscadesof her enemies Engrave upon thetender hearts of the little ones the obedience theyowe to God, to their parents, to their prince, and toall who are placed in authority over them, to inspirethem with a horror of vice, and a love of virtue ;"the relief of the poor : " your door is the first at whichthe tale of distress, or the cry of misery is heard ; letthe poor always find in you the sympathy of a father,the heart, the bowels of tenderness and compassion ;"the comforting of the sick, especially, "at that awfulhour, which is, perhaps, to decide their eternal lot ;the sinner, at that moment seeing that every thing isdisappearing from his eyes, that this world and thedesires thereof, have passed away, that he himself ispassing like a shadow, will listen with more attentionto your pious exhortations, he will yield to your sighsand to your tears ;" the amicable adjustment of quarrelsand disputes; "seat yourselves down like angelsof peace in the midst of the dissensions, which may.DANIEL MURRAY. 491through human infirmity, occur between your people,and reconcile, by the sweetness of your manner andthe attractions of grace, hearts, which for a momentmay have been alienated from each other." " Remember,then," concludes the document, "that anecclesiastic, whether officiating in the sanctuary, ordwelling in the midst of the world, should appear andbe a man of superior mind and exalted virtue ; a manwhose example can improve society, whose irreproachablemanners can reflect honour on the Church andadd to the glory and splendour of religion ; a man,whose modesty should be apparent to all men, as theapostle recommends, and who should be clothed withjustice, according to the expression of a prophet."This summary of the qualifications and duties of aChristian divine has been thus largely extracted, asaffording the most eloquent illustration of DoctorMurray s life and character. " Of the abundance ofthe heart his mouth speaketh." What he inculcated,himself effected, what he prescribed he practised ; unshaken,unstained, by even the ruder assaults of anIrish element, he stands forth a pillar of strength andornament to the temple of his faith.It but remains to state, that in April, 1 829, thelong deferred measure, that would have made millionshappy, received the royal assent; and those cruelenactments against the Roman Catholic hierarchyand laity, which intolerance had devised in the daysof Elizabeth, and rapine and fanaticism pressed intotheir service during those of the Stuart ; those penaltiesand disabilities, which, from the time of the492 ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN.accession of the illustrious house of Brunswick hadbeen successively deprecated relaxed disused, wereon this welcome occasion utterly abolished. In necessaryconnexion with the latter portion of thesememoirs, it has been an unwelcome duty to recalsome of the bitter inflictions of that penal code, aswell in the earlier period of its growth and vigour,as in the times when, although politically only sufferedto wear out its strength, it was too frequentlybrought forward in mischievous action by evil governorsand selfish subjects. It has been howeverthe object of the author, in introducing such allusions,as far as possible to avoid giving any opinions orcomments of his own, or pertinaciously censuringthose of others when fairly and honourably dissentientfrom his. The course of his life has been studiouslyremoved from party excitements and unholy bigotries,and he fondly indulges the hope, he may live to seetheday, when on their utter extinction, peace, brotherlylove, industry, and universal liberty may smileupon his native land.END OF THE MEMOIRS OF THE ARCHBISHOPS OF DUBLIN
