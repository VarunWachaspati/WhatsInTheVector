It isfounded on many series of accurate observations, on severallines taken across Europe, between the British islands andthe Mediterranean Sea. Although no single straight lineexhibits every formation complete in the full order ofsuccession here represented, no fact is inserted for whichauthority cannot be found. The near approximation ofthis synoptic representation to the facts exhibited by anactual section, may be estimated by comparing it withthe admirable section across Europe, published by Mr.Conybeare in the Report of the Proceedings of the BritishAssociation for the Advancement of Science, 1832, andwith his sections of England, in Phillips and Conybeare'sGeology of England and Wales.The chief merit of the above Section is due to theTalents of Mr. Thomas Webster ; it is founded on a moresimple section which has for several years been used byhim in his lectures, and which exhibits the relations ofthe Granitic and Volcanic rocks to the stratified formations,G. II. bZ EXPLANATION OF PLATE 1.and to one another, more intelligibly than I have ever seenexpressed elsewhere. This original drawing by Mr. Websterhas formed the basis of the present enlarged andimproved section, into which many important additionshave been introduced by the joint suggestions of Mr. Websterand myself. The selection and arrangement of theanimals and plants is my own ; they have been drawn andengraved (together with a large proportion of the woodcuts)by Mr. J. Fisher, of St. Clements, Oxford.For facility of reference, I have numbered the principalgroups of stratified rocks represented in the section,according to their most usual order of succession; andI have designated by letters the crystalline or unstratifiedrocks, and the injected masses and dykes, as well as themetallic veins, and lines of fracture, producing dislocationsor faults. The crowded condition in which all the Phenomenarepresented in this section, are set together, doesnot admit of the use of accurate relative proportions,between the stratified rocks and the intruded masses, veins,and dykes by which they are intersected. The adoptionof false proportions is, however, unavoidable in these cases,because the veins and dykes would be invisible, unlessexpressed on a highly exaggerated scale. The scale ofheight throughout the whole section is also infinitely greaterthan that of breadth. The plants and animals also arefigured on no uniform scale.The extent of the different formations represented in thissection, taking their average width as they occur in Europe,would occupy a breadth of five or six hundred miles. Ascale of heights, at all approaching to this scale of breadth,would render the whole almost invisible. The same causemakes it also impossible to express correctly the effect ofvallies of denudation, which are often excavated throughstrata of one formation into those of another subjacentformation.EXPLANATION OF PLATE 1. 3As it would encumber the section to express Diluvium,wherever it is present, it is introduced in one place only,which shews its age to be more recent than the newest ofthe Tertiary strata; it is found also lodged indiscriminatelyupon the surface of rocks of every formation.Granite.In our early Chapters we have considered the Theorywhich refers unstratified rocks to an igneous Origin, to bethat which is most consistent with all the known Phenomenaof Geology, and the facts represented in the Sectionnow before us are more consistent with the Postulates ofthis Hypothesis, than with those of any other that hashitherto been proposed. I have, therefore, felt it indispensableto adopt its language, as affording the only terms bywhich the facts under consideration can be adequately described.Assuming that Fire and Water have been the twogreat Agents employed in reducing the surface of the globeto its actual condition, we see, in repeated operations ofthese agents, causes adequate to the production of thoseirregular Elevations and Depressions of the fundamentalRocks of the Granitic series, which are delineated in thelower Region of our Section, as forming the basis of theentire Superstructure of stratified Rocks.Near the right extremity of this Section, the undulatingsurface of the fundamental Granite (a. 5. a. 6. a. 7. a. 8.)is represented as being, for the most part, beneath the levelof the Sea.On the left extremity of the Section (a. 1. a. 2. a. 3.) theGranite is elevated into one of those lofty Alpine ridges,which have affected, by their upward movement, the entireseries of stratified Rocks.Corresponding formations of Primary and Transition4 EXPLANATION OF PLATE 1.Strata, are represented as occurring on each side of this elevatedGranite, which is supposed to have broken through,and to have carried up with it to their present elevated andhighly inclined position, strata that were once continuousand nearly horizontal.*The general history of Elevation appears to be, thatmountain chains of various extent, and various directions,have been formed at irregular intervals, during the depositionof stratified rocks of every age ; and that Granite had,in many cases, acquired a state of solidity before theperiod of its elevation.Within the primary Granite, we find other forms of Graniticmatter, (a. 9.) which appear to have been intruded in astate of fusion, not only into fissures of the older Granite,but frequently also into the Primary stratified rocks in contactwith it, and occasionally into strata of the Transitionand Secondary series, (a. 10. a. 11.) these Granitic injectionswere probably in many cases, contemporaneous withthe elevation of the rocks they intersect ; they usually assumethe Condition of Veins, terminating upwards in smallbranches ; and vary in dimensions, from less than an inch,to an indefinite width. The direction of these veins is veryirregular : they sometimes traverse the Primary strata atright angles to their planes of stratification, at other timesthey are protruded in a direction parallel to these planes,and assume the form of beds. Some of the relations ofthese Granitic Veins to the rocks intersected by them arerepresented at the left extremity of the Section, (a. 9.)f .Cases of Granite, thus elevated at a period posterior to thedeposition of Tertiary Strata, occur in the Eastern Alps, where theTransition, Secondary, and Tertiary strata have all partaken of thesame elevation which raised the central axis of the crystalline Graniticrocks. See Geol. Trans. N. S. Vol. III. PI. 36. Fig. 1.f In the Granite at the right extremity of the Section, the graniticveins are omitted, because their insertion would interfere withEXPLANATION OF PLATE 1. 3A. 10. represents a dyke and protruded mass of Granite,intersecting and overlying stratified rocks of the Primaryand Transition series. A. 11. represents the rare case ofGranite intersecting Red Sandstone, Oolite, and Chalk.*Sienite, Porphyry, Serpentine, Greenstone.Closely allied to Granitic Veins, is a second series ofirregularly injected rocks, composed of Sienite, Porphyry,Serpentine, and Green Stone (b. c. d. e.) which traverse thePrimary and Transition formations, and the lower regionsof the Secondary strata ; not only intersecting them in variousdirections, but often forming also overlying masses,in places where these veins have terminated by overflowingat the surface, (b'. c'. d'. e'.) The crystalline rocks ofthis series, present so many modifications of their ingredients,that numerous varieties of Sienite, Porphyry, andGreenstone occur frequently in the products of Eruptionsfrom a single vent.The scale of our Section admits not of an accurate representationof the relations between many of these intrudedrocks, and the strata they intersect ; they are all placed, asthe representation of the injections of Basaltic and Volcanic matterwhich that portion of the section is intended to illustrate.An example of the rare Phenomenon of Granite intruded intothe Chalk formation, in the hill of St. Martin, near Pont de la Fouin the Pyrenees, is described by M. Dufrenoy in the Bulletin de laSociete Geological de France, Tom. 2. page 73.At Weinbbhla, near Meissen in Saxony, Prof. Weiss has ascertainedthe presence of Sienite above strata of Chalk ; and Prof.Nauman states, that, near Oberau, Cretaceous rocks are covered byGranite, and that near Zscheila and Neiderfehre, the Cretaceousrocks rest horizontally on Granite ; at both these places the Limestoneand Granite are entangled in each other, and irregular portionsand veins of hard Limestone, with green grains and cretaceousfossils, are here and there imbedded in the Granite.De la Beche. Geol. Manual. 3rd Edit. p. 295.O EXPLANATION OF PLATE 1.if they had been injected, either at the time of, or after theelevation of all the strata, and had produced but littledisturbance in the rocks through which they are protruded.It should however be understood, distinctly, that some Injectionsmay have preceded the elevation of Strata to theirpresent height, and that numerous and successive elevationsand injections, attended by various degrees of fractureand disturbance, have prevailed in various localitiesduring all periods, and throughout all formations ; from thefirst upraising of the earliest Primary rocks, to the mostrecent movements produced by existing Volcanoes. M.Elie de Beaumont has discovered probable evidence of noless than twelve periods of elevation, affecting the strata ofEurope.Examples of the fractures and dislocations attendingthese movements, and producing faults, are represented inour Section by the lines designated by the letter 1. Some ofthese fractures do not reach to the present surface, as theyaffected the lower beds at periods anterior to the depositionof more recent strata, which cover unconformably thesummits of the earlier fractures. (See 1. I 1 . I 2 . I 3 . I 6 . I 7 .)Basalt.A third series of Igneous Rocks is that which has formeddykes, and masses of Basalt and Trap, intruded into, andoverlying formations of all ages, from the earliest Granitesto the most recent Tertiary Strata. These basaltic rockssometimes occur as Beds, nearly parallel to the strata, intowhich they are protruded, after the manner represented inthe carboniferous Limestone of our Section, f. 2. More frequentlythey overspread the surface like expanded sheetsof Lava. Our Section gives examples of Trap under allthese circumstances. At f. 1. it intersects and overliesPrimary strata ; at f. 2. f. 3. f. 4. f. 5. it stands in similarEXPLANATION OF PLATE 1. 7relations to Transition and Secondary strata ; f. 6. representsan example of an extensive eruption of Basaltic matter,over Chalk and Tertiary strata, accompanied by an intrusionof vast irregular masses of the same materials into thebody of the subjacent Primary and Transition rocks.f. 7. represents strata of columnar Basalt, immediatelybeneath streams of cellular Lava, in regions occupied alsoby craters of extinct Volcanos. f. 8. represents similarbeds of columnar lava in the vicinity of active Volcanos.Trachyte and Lava.The fourth and last class of intruded rocks, is that ofmodern volcanic Porphyries, Trachytes,* and Lavas. Theundeniable igneous origin of rocks of this class forms thestrongest ground-work of our arguments, in favour of theigneous formation of the older unstratified and crystallinerocks ; and their varied recent products, around the cratersof active Volcanos, present gradations of structure, andcomposition, which connect them with the most ancientPorphyries, Senates, and Granites.The simplest cases of volcanic action are those of Trachyte(g. 1.) and of Lava (i. 5.) ejected through aperturesin Granite ; such cases prove that the source of volcanicfires, is wholly unconnected with the pseudo-volcanic resultsof the combustion of coal, bitumen, or sulphur, instratified formations, and is seated deep beneath the PrimaryrocksThe appellation of Trachyte has been given to a volcanic Porphyry,usually containing Crystals of glassy felspar, and remarkablyharsh to the touch, (hence its name from Tga^vq) ; it does not occur inBritain, but abounds in the neighbourhood of almost all extinct andactive volcanic craters.f The occurrence of angular fragments of altered Granite, embeddedin Pillars of columnar Lava, in the valley of Monpezat in theArdeche, shews that these fragments were probably torn off duringO EXPLANATION OF PLATE 1.Craters.Our section represents three cases of Volcanic craters ;the most simple (i. 5.) rising through Granite, or stratifiedrocks, at the bottom of the sea, and accumulating craters,which, like those of Lipari and Stromboli, Sabrina, andGraham Islands, are occasionally formed in various partsof the ocean.* The second case is that of volcanos,which, like Etna and Vesuvius, are still in action on thedry land, (i. 1. to i. 4.) The third is that of extinct volcanos,like those in Auvergne, (h 1 . h 2 .) which, althoughthere exist no historical records as to the period of theirlast eruptions, shew by the perfect condition of their craters,that they have been formed since the latest of thoseaqueous inundations, that have affected the Basalts andTertiary strata, through which they have burst forth.One great difference between the more ancient Basalticeruptions and those of the Lava and Trachyte of existingvolcanos, is that the emission of the former, probably takingplace under the pressure of deep water, was not accompaniedby the formation of any permanent craters.In both cases, the fissures through some of which theseEruptions may have issued, are abundantly apparent underthe upward passage of the Lava through fractures in the solidGranite.At Graveneire, near Clement, a stream of Lava still retains theexact form, in which it issued through a fissure in the side of amountain of Granite, and overflowed the subjacent valley. Mostaccurate representations of this, and many similar productions ofVolcanic Eruptions from the Granite of this District may be seenin Mr. Poulettt Scrope's inimitable Panoramic Views of the Volcanicformations of Central France.Within the last few years, the Volcanic Cones of Sabrina in theAtlantic, and of Graham Island in the Mediterranean, have risensuddenly in the sea and been soon levelled and dispersed by theWaves.EXPLANATION OF PLATE 1. l)the form of Dykes, filled with materials similar to thosewhich form the masses that have overflowed in the Vicinityof each Dyke. #Changes effected by the Igneous Rocks, on the Stratain contact with them.The peculiar condition of the rocks that form the sidewalls of Granitic Veins and Basaltic Dykes, affords anotherargument in favour of their igneous origin ; thuswherever the early Slate rocks are intersected by GraniticVeins (a. 8.) they are usually altered to a state approximatingto that of fine-grained Mica-Slate, or Hornblende-slate.The Secondary and Tertiary rocks also, when they areintersected by basaltic Dykes, have frequently undergonesome change ; beds of Shale and Sandstone are indurated,and reduced to Jasper; compact Limestone and Chalk areconverted to crystalline Marble, and Chalk-flints altered toa state like that resulting from heat in an artificial furnacesIn all these cases, the Phenomena appear to be throughoutconsistent with the theory of igneous Injection, and tobe incapable of explanation on any other Hypothesis thathas been proposed. A summary statement of the probablerelations of the Granitic and Trappean Rocks to the othermaterials of the Globe, and to one another, may be foundin De la Beche's Geological Researches, 1st Edit. Pag.374, et seq.In many dykes the materials have been variously modified, bytheir mode of cooling, and differ from the masses which overflowedthe surface.f Examples of this kind occur on the sides of Basaltic Dykes intersectingChalk in the County of Antrim, and in the Island ofRaglan.

(Conybeare.)8. View of the lower Jaw of Ichthyosaurus seen fromcockles ; but as the horny scales of Fishes, and dermal bones of Crocodileanimals are preserved in the same Lias with the bones ofIchthyosauri, we may infer that if the latter animals had been furnishedwith any similar appendages, these would also have been preserved,and long ere this discovered, among the numerous remainsthat have been so assiduously collected from the Lias. They wouldcertainly have been found in the case of the individual now beforeus, in which even the Epidermis and vessels of the Rete Mucoushave escaped destruction.Similar black patches of petrified skin are not unfrequently foundattached to the skeletons of Ichthyosauri from Lyme Regis, but noremains of any other soft parts of the body have yet been noticed.The preservation of the skin shews that a short interval only elapsedbetween the death of the animal, and its interment in the muddy sedimentof which the Lias is composed.Among living reptiles, the Batrachians afford an example of anorder in which the skin is naked, having neither scales nor dermalbones.In the case of Lizards and Crocodiles, the scaly, or bony coveringsprotect the skin from injury by friction against the hard substanceswith which they are liable to come into contact upon the land ; butto the Ichthyosauri which lived exclusively in the sea, there wouldseem to have been no more need of the protection of scales ordermal bones, than to the naked skin of Cetacea.In the case of Plesiosauri also, the non-discovery of the remainsof any dermal appendages with the perfect skeletons of animals ofthat genus, leads to a similar inference, that they too had a nakedskin. The same negative argument applies to the flying ReptileFamily of Pterodactyles.24 EXPLANATION OF PLATES 11. 12.beneath, exhibiting the course of its over lappingbones. (Conybeare.)A.

Occipital and Cervical Bones of Ichthyosaurus,from the Lias at Lyme Regis.* (Original.)Sir Philip de Malpas Grey Egerton has pointed out some beautifulexamples, hitherto unnoticed, in the Atlas and cervical Vertebraeof Ichthyosauri, of peculiar mechanical contrivances to supportand regulate the movements of their enormous heads. (SeeLond. and Edin. Phil. Mag. Nov. 1835. p. 414.)Fig. 3, a. represents the Basilar portion of the Occipital bone of avery large and aged Ichthyosaurus, from the Lias of Lyme Regis,(scale one eighth). The nearly hemispherical process (a) articulatedwith a comparatively shallow socket in front of the Atlas, (4. a.)and this ball and socket, or universal joint, gave freedom of motionand support to a weighty head.Fig. 4. Atlas and Axis of a very young Ichthyosaurus, (two thirdsof nat. size.) These bones adhere together by two nearly flat surfaces,admitting of the least flexure of any of the Vertebras in thewhole body, but giving the greatest strength to that part of theColumn, where strength rather than flexure was required.On the inferior margins of the Atlas and Axis and third cervicalvertebra, are triangular facets articulating with three strong wedge-shapedsub-vertebral bones (c) hitherto described.EXPLANATION OF PLATES 12. 13. 25A.

Oblique triangular facet on the lower margin of thefront of the Atlas ; this facet articulated with the first sub-vertebralwedge, placed between the Atlas and Occiput.Between the Atlas and Axis, the two sub-vertebral facets formed atriangular cavity for the reception of a second wedge (Fig. 4. c.)and a similar, but smaller cavity received another wedge of thesame kind, between the Axis and third Vertebra. This third wedgegave less support to the head, and admitted of more extensive motionthan the second. All these three wedge-shaped bones are seennearly in their natural position in a specimen from Lyme Regis, inthe Collection of Sir P. G. Egerton.Fig. 4'.

In young animals this frontal facetis nearly smooth and flat ; in older animals (3. b'.) it is rugged andfurrowed. This articulation must have given to the first sub-vertebralwedge great power as a stay or prop, to resist the downward pressureof the head, at the same time facilitating the rotatory movementsof the Occipital bone.Fig. 4. c. Second sub-vertebral wedge articulating with the triangularcavity formed by the marginal facets of the Atlas and Axis.This second Wedge acted as a strong prop supporting firmly thelower portion of the Atlas, and at the same time admitting the smallamount of motion here required.c'.

I. p. 191.Skeleton of the Trunk of a small Ichthyosaurus in theFig. 5. Nearly flat articular surface of (probably) the third cervicalvertebra of the same large Individual as Fig. 3. This surface ofthe bone has only a small cylindrical depression at its centre, insteadof the deep, conical cup of the more flexible vertebras, Cab. E.Near its upper margin is a wedge-shaped elevation (b) and nearthe inferior margin, a notch or furrow (a). These salient and reenteringportions articulated with corresponding depressions andprojections on the surface of the adjacent vertebra, and acted aspivots, admitting a limited amount of lateral vibrations, and at thesame time preventing any slip, or dislocation.Fig. 6. Concave surface of Fig. 5. ; the wedge-shaped projectionnear its lower margin (a) must have articulated with a correspondinggroove or depression on the front of the vertebra adjacent to it,like that at (Fig. 5. a.) As one surface only of these vertebras hada conical cavity, the intervertebral substance must have formed asingle cone, admitting in the neck but half the amount of motion, thatthe double cones of intervertebral matter allowed to the dorsal andcaudal vertebras, (C. B. E.) where greater flexure was required, toeffect progressive motion by vibrations of the body and tail.These dispositions of the articulating facets of the cervical vertebras,acting in conjunction with the three sub-vertebral wedgesbefore described, afford an example of peculiar provisions in theneck of these gigantic Reptiles, to combine a diminished amount offlexure in this part, with an increased support to their enormousheads.It is probable that every species of Ichthyosaurus had peculiar variationsin the details of the cervical vertebras, and sub vertebral wedges,and that in each species these variations were modified by age.In the Gavial Mr. Mantelll has recently observed that the firstcaudal vertebra is doubly convex, like the last cervical vertebra inTurtles. These peculiar contrivances give to the animals in whichthey occur increased flexibility of the Tail and Neck.EXPLANATION OF PLATE 15. 27Oxford Museum, from the Lias at Lyme Regis, containingwithin the ribs, a prolific mass of digested bones, interspersedwith scales of fishes, a, Furcula. b, Clavicle, c,Coracoid bone, d, Scapula, e, Humerus.

(Original.)On comparing this figure with those of P. Dolichodeirusat PL 16, 17. The following differences are obvious :1. The head is very much larger and longer, beingnearly one half the length of the neck.2. The vertebrae of the neck are thicker and stronger inproportion to the greater weight they had to sustain.3. The hatchet-shaped bones differ in form and size, asmay be seen by comparing them with those of P. dolicho-deirus. PI. 19. Fig. 2. and PI. 17.4. The bones of the arm and thigh are shorter andstronger than in P. Dolichodeirus, and corresponding differencesmay be traced throughout the smaller bones of thePaddles; the general adjustment of all the proportionsbeing calculated to produce greater strength in the P. Macrocephalus,than in the more slender limbs of P. Dolicho-deirus.These differences are not the effect of age ; as the twospecimens, from which they are here described, are nearlyof the same length.Fig. 2.

Brongniart, in his Terrain de VEcorce du Globe,.1829, has applied to this middle division the very appropriatename of Terrain Pacified, (from the Greek itom(*o$),a term equivalent to the names Bunter Sandstein, andGoes bizarre, which it bears in Germany and France ; andindicating the same strata which, in England, we call thenew Red Sandstone. (See Plate 1. Section No. 17.)Mr. Conybeare, in his Report on Geology to the BritishAssociation at Oxford, 1832 (Page 379, and P. 405, Note),has proposed to extend the term Paicilitic to the entireGroup of strata between the Coal formation and the Lias;including the five formations designated in our section(PI. 1, No. 15, 16. 17, 18, 19), by the names of New RedConglomerate, Magnesian Limestone, Variegated Sandstone,Shell Limestone, and Variegated Marl. Some commonappellative for all these formations has been long adesideratum in Geology ; but the word Pczcilitic is insound so like to Polite, that it may be better to adheremore literally to the Greek root ttoihi?^, and apply thecommon name of Poikilitic group to the strata in question.*The general reception of such a common name for all thesestrata, and the separation of the Grauwacke series into the Cambrianand Silurian systems, as proposed by Professor Sedgwick and Mr.Murchison, will afford three nearly equal and most convenient groupsor systems, into which the strata composing the Transition and Secondaryseries may respectively be divided ; the former comprehendingthe Cambrian, Silurian, and Carboniferous systems, and thelatter comprehending the Poikilitic, Oolitic, and Cretaceous Groups.EXPLANATION OF PLATE 26\ 39Plate 26 a .Ornithichnites, or foot-marks of several extinct speciesof birds, found in the New Red sandstone of the Valleyof the Connecticut.* (Hitchcock.)In the American Journal of Science and Arts, January, 1836.V. XXIX. No. 2. Professor Hitchcock has published a most interestingaccount of his recent discovery of Ornithichnites, or footmarksof birds in the New Red sandstone of the valley of the Connecticut.These tracks have been found at various depths beneaththe actual surface, in quarries of laminated flag stones, at five placesnear the banks of this river, within a distance of thirty miles. Thesandstone is inclined from 5Â°, to 30Â°, and the Tracks appear tohave been made on it before the strata received their inclination.Seven of these tracks occur in three or four quarries within thespace of a few rods square ; they are so distinct, that he considersthem to have been made by as many different species, if not genera,of birds. (See PL 26% Figs. 1â€”14.)The footsteps appear in regular succession, on the continuous trackof an animal in the act of walking or running, with the right and leftfoot always in their relative places.The distance of the intervals between each footstep on the sametrack is occasionally varied, but to no greater amount than may beexplained by the Bird having altered its pace. Many tracks of differentindividuals and different species are often found crossing oneanother ; they are sometimes crowded like impressions of feet on themuddy shores of a stream, or pond, where Ducks and Geese resort.(See PL 26 a . Figs. 12. 13. 14.)None of the footsteps appear to be those of Web-footed Birds ;they most nearly resemble those of Gralla?, (Waders) or birds whosehabits resemble those of Galls. The impressions of three toes areusually distinct, except in a few instances ; that of the fourth or hindtoe is mostly wanting, as in the footsteps of modern Gralla?.The most remarkable among these footsteps, are those of a giganticbird, twice the size of an Ostrich, whose foot measured fifteeninches in length, exclusive of the largest claw, which measured twoinches. All the three toes were broad and thick. (PI. 26 a . Fig. 1.and P1.26 b . Fig. 1.) These largest footsteps have as yet been foundin one quarry only, at Mount Tom near Northampton ; here, fournearly parallel tracks of this kind were discovered, ajax in one ofthem six footsteps appeared in regular succession, at the distance of40 EXPLANATIONS OF PLATE 26 a .The fossil tracks on this Plate are all nearly on the samescale : viz. one-twenty-fourth. The recent footsteps are ona larger scale.four feet from one another. In others the distance varied from fourto six feet ; the latter was probably the longest step of this giganticbird while running.Next in size to these are the footsteps of another enormous bird(PI. 26a. Fig. 4.) having three toes of a more slender character, measuringfrom fifteen to sixteen inches long, exclusive of a remarkableappendage extending backwards from the heel eight or nine inches,and apparently intended, like a snow shoe, to sustain the weight ofa heavy animal walking on a soft bottom. (See PI. 26 b . Fig. 2.) Theimpressions of this appendage resemble those of wiry feathers, orcoarse bristles, which seem to have sunk into the mud and sandnearly an inch deep; the toes had sunk much deeper, and roundtheir impressions the mud was raised into a ridge several inches high,like that around the track of an Elephant in Clay. The length ofthe step of this Bird appears to have been sometimes six feet. Onthe other tracks the steps are shorter, and the smallest impressionindicates a foot but one inch long, with a step of from three to fiveinches. (PI. 26 a . 2. 3. 5â€”14.)In every track the length of the step increases with the size of thefoot, and is much longer in proportion than the steps of any existingspecies of birds ; hence it is inferred that these ancient birds had agreater length of leg than even modern Gallia. The steps at fourfeet asunder probably indicate a leg of six feet long.In the African Ostrich, which weighs lOOlbs, and is nine feet high,the length of the leg is about four feet, and that of the foot teninches.All these tracks appear to have been made on the Margin of shallowwater that was subject to changes of level, and in which sedimentsof sand and mud were alternately deposited, and the length ofleg, which must be inferred from the distance of the footsteps fromeach other, was well adapted for wading in such situations. NoTraces of any Bones but those of fishes (Palseothrissum) have yetbeen found in the rock containing these footsteps, which are of thehighest interest to the Palaeontologist, as they establish the new factof the existence of Birds at the early epoch of the New Red sandstoneformation ; and further shew that some of the most ancientforms of this class attained a size, far exceeding that of the largestamong the feathered inhabitants of the present world, and wereadapted for wading and running, rather than for flight.EXPLANATION OF PLATE 26 a . 41Fig. 1.

Tubercles and Scales, illustrating the fournew Orders of Fishes, established by ProfessorAgassiz. (Agassiz.)Mr. Poulettt Scrope lias presented to the Geol. Soc. of Londona series of Slabs selected from the tile quarries worked in the ForestMarble beds of the Oolite formation near Bradford and Bath. Thesurface of these beds is covered with small undulations or ripple markings,such as are common on the sand of every shallow shore, and alsowith numerous tracks of small animals (apparently Crustaceans)which traversed the sand in various directions, whilst it was yet soft,and covered with a thin film of clay. These footmarks are in doublelines parallel to each other, shewing two indentations, as if formedby small claws, and sometimes traces of a third claw. (See PI. 2C b ,Fig. 3.) There is often also a third line of tracks between the othertwo, as if produced by the tail or stomach of the animal touching theground. Where the animal passed over the ridges of the ripplemarkings or wrinkles on the sand, they are flattened and brusheddown. Thus a ridge between b. and d. (PI. 26 b , Fig. 3) has beenflattened, and there is a hollow at e. on the steep side of the ridge,which may have been produced by the animal slipping down orclimbing up the acclivity.Explain iATION OF PLATE 27. 43Fio. 8. a.

These greatSauroid fishes, which were first recognized at Edinburgh, in Sept.1834, have also been detected in the English Coal fields of Newcastleon Tyne, Leeds, and Newcastle under Line.44 EXPLANATION OF PLATES 27 a . 27 b .Plate 27 a .

Jan. 1836, the author haspublished a notice of his recent discovery of the jaws of four extinctspecies of fossil fishes of the genus Chimaera, a genus hitherto unknownin' a fossil state. The only known species (C. monstrous)approximates most nearly to the family of Sharks ; and is foundpursuing Herrings and other migratory fishes. The Chimaera is oneof the most remarkable among living fishes, as a link in the family ofChondropterygians ; and the discovery of a similar link, in the geologicalepochs of the Oolitic and Cretaceous formations, shews thatthe duration of this curious genus has extended through a greaterrange of geological epochs, than that of any other genus of fishes yetascertained by Professor Agassiz, and leads to important considerationsin Physiology.The Chimaera partakes of one remarkable character with the Ces-tractionPhillippi, whereby this species alone, among living Sharks,is connected with the extinct forms of that family, in having the firstray of the dorsal fin enlarged into a strong bony spine armed withsharp hooks, like the Ichthyodorulite of the earliest fossil Sharks,48 EXPLANATION OF PLATES 27 f . 28.has brought clusters of these tubercles into contactwith the bone in several parts of fig. 1.

This fossil exhibitsat its smaller End, from d. to b. y a series ofcasts of the Air chambers, from which the externalshell has been removed. The cavity of each chamberis filled with a disc of pure calcareous spar,representing the exact form of the chamber intowhich it had been infiltrated.

I possess a specimen of a fossil Nautilus from the Lias atLyme Regis, in which the external open chamber contains a Rhinechlorite.f This fossil exhibits the Siphuncle in its proper place, passingEXPLANATION OJ PLATE 32, .J.JFig. 3. represents in its natural size, a portion of theSiphuncle which in Fig. 2. is laid bare along itscourse through the chambers, d. e.f.

As in the recent NautilusPoinpilius, there is no communication between the interior of theSiphon and that of the Air chambers, so in this fossil shell, there isproof that no communication existed between these cavities. Atransverse section at a. shews the thin edge of the sheath of the siphuncle,surrounded externally with calcareous spar, and filledinternally with Grit. Other Sections of the Siphuncle at b. d. e.f.shew the calcareous Grit within its cavities to be contracted at itspassage through the collars of the transverse plates, and most enlargedmidway between one transverse plate and another.This fossil affords two proofs that no communication existed betweenthe interior" of the Siphuncle and that of the Air chambers. 1st.the calcareous sheath of the Siphuncle is seen at d. e. f. completelyenclosing the calcareous grit which forms the cast within it. 2dly,had there been any communication between the interior of the siphuncle,and that of the air chambers, these chambers must havereceived some portion of the materials of the grit that have filledthis Siphuncle : not a particle of grit is found in any one of theadjacent air chambers, but they are all lined, and some of themnearly filled with a crystalline deposit of Carbonate of Lime, disposedin uniform plates around the interior of each chamber, and aroundthe Siphuncle. See Fig. 2. c. c 1 . a. a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , and Fig. 3. d â€” k. Thisdeposit can only have been formed from water charged with carbonateof lime, introduced by infiltration, after the interment of theshell, and filling the chambers which are thus uniformly invested.56 EXPLANATION OF PLATES 33. 34.Plate 33.

Hence it follows that no communicationexisted between the Siphuncle and these chambers, at the time whenthis Pipe was filled with the fluid mud, that has formed a cast of Liaswithin it. As the fractures across the Siphuncle in the 2nd and 3rdchambers are filled only with spar, of the same kind as that withinthese Chambers, these fractures could not have existed, when theMud of the Lias formation entered the Siphuncle, without admittingit also into the chambers adjacent to them.EXPLANATION OF PLATE 34. 57a.

The overflowing of this pericardial fluid may pass outthrough the orifices marked by the bristles, c. c.f This upper portion or neck of the Siphuncle, has the form of aflattened canal, with thin Parietes of the same substance as the Pericardium; when the animal expands itself at the bottom of the sea,this neck is probably closed by the lateral pressure of the gizzard, k,and ovary, I, and so acts instead of a valve to prevent the return ofthe pericardial fluid into the Siphuncle. At such times, the deep-seawater must press with great force on the exterior of the Pericardium,and tend to force the pericardial fluid into the Siphuncle; but as anequal amount of pressure is applied simultaneously to the Ovary and58 EXPLANATION OF PLATES 35. 36.Plate 35.

See V. I. p. 351, Note.Von Buch has found evidence to shew that the membranoussigh uncle of Ammonites was continued to a considerabledistance along the outer chamber, beyond the lastor largest transverse Plate.

Similar spiral flutings are introduced for thesame purpose on the surface of thin glass pocket smelling-bottles.In other glass flasks of the same kind which aremade in Germany, the addition of bosses to the surfacesof the flat sides of the bottles, produces a similar doubleresult of ornament and strength.Plate 38.

Anstice in nodulesof Iron stone from the Coal formation of CoalbrookDale.Fig. 1 nearly resembles some of the South Americantypes of Curculio, but the antennae are longer andstronger than is usual in living species. Only theback of the head is visible, with faint indications ofthe place of the eyes ; the Rostrum is not apparent,it probably descends into the Iron stone beneath,and this position will explain the appearance andplace of the Antennae.The Elytra seem to have been connate towardstheir lower extremity, but their line of junction isvisible towards the Thorax. The substance of theElytra and Thorax, and of portions of the legs isreplaced by white Iron ore, having the lustre ofSatin.Mr. Curtis conceives that the tufted appearanceof the legs may have been caused by fungi formedafter death, as often happens in tropical climates.The enlargement of the Femur of the hindmost legin our fossil is a character peculiar to the Circus# (Original.)Fig. 2. Mr. Samouelle considers this extinct fossil speciesto approach most nearly to the Brachycerusuterus of Africa. f (Original.)Until more perfect data are found, on which generic characterscan be established, I propose to designate this Insect by the provisionalname of Curculioides Ansticii.f The animal lies on its back with the left side raised upwards,and exhibiting a portion of the exterior surface of the left Elytron.At a. &.are the remains of antenna?, and near the base of a, ap-explanationOF PLATE 46". 77Fig. 3.

Two spinous tubercles project from near its posteriorextremity, and a corresponding tubercle from the extremity ofthe right elytron. Similar spines occur on the Elytrons of Brachiaand of some Curculionidas of N. Holland. The abdominalrings are very distinct. I shall designate this Insect by the provisionalname of Curculioides Prestvicii.M. Bedouin exhibited at the meeting of the Naturforscher at Bonn,in September, 1835, a beautiful wing of a neuropterous Insect, in anodule of clay Iron stone, apparently also from the neighbourhoodof Coalbrook Dale, which had been purchased at the sale of Parkinson'scollection by Mr. Mantelll, and transmitted by him to M.Brongniart". This wing is nearly three inches long, and closely resemblesthat of the living Corydalis of Carolina and Pennsylvania ;it is much broader and nearly of the length of the wing of a largeDragon Fly.Several specimens of this species are in the collection of Mr.Win. Anstice at Madely Wood. Our figure is taken from a cast orimpression of the back of the animal in Iron stone, in which thetransverse lines across the abdominal segment are not very apparent; other specimens exhibit deep transverse flutings, externallyresembling the separate segments of the back of a Trilobite, butapparently not dividing the shell into more than one abdominalPlate, nor admitting of flexure like the articulating segments of aTrilobite.The transverse depressions on the back of the second segment of78 EXPLANATION OF PLATE 46".Figs. 4 â€” 9.

This Limulus is the Entomologymonopolies of Martin, ( Petrifaction Derhiensia, Tab. 45, Fig. 4.)andBelinurus bellulus of Kong, (Icon. Sect. PL XVIII. No. 230.)M. Parkinson, Org. Rem. iii. PL XVII. Fig. 18, has figured a similarfossil from Dudley, in iron stone of the Coal formation.Mr. Rr. C. Taylor mentions the occurrence of the wing covers ofBeetles in the shale of the Darby Coal pits, in the Eastern Moorlandsof Yorkshire. This shale has nearly the same place in theOolitic series as the Stonesfield slate. See London's Mag. Nat. Hist.V. iii. P. 361.In the private collection of Dr. de Piebald at Leyden, I saw inOct. 1835, a most beautiful and unique specimen of a Buprestis, fromJapan, about an inch long, converted to Chalcedony. Even theantennae and portions of the legs are distinctly preserved.In the same collection are fragments of silicified trees, bored withtubular cavities, apparently by the larvae of animals of this kind ;and within these cavities, a quantity of dust, produced by the boring,was observed by M. Brongniart to be converted to Chalcedony.From this circumstance we may conjecture that the perfect insectwas lodged in a similar tube, when it became transformed into Chalcedony.The surface of this Insect is covered with clusters of minuteconcentric rings of Chalcedony (Orbicular of Brongniart) so commonin silicified fossil shells.EXPLANATION OF PLATE 47. 79and is nearly related to the genus Bibio, which isnow widely distributed, being common in Europe,and in N. and S.

The lateral projectionsare the commencement of the side arms.This specimen has been corroded with acid, and consequentlyhas lost the superficial Corrugations andin his admirable Monograph on Crinoidea, p. 97. " The mechanismof the joints of the side arms, where these insert into the column, iswell worthy of notice, particularly in old specimens. In the earlierstage of their formation, the side arms being very short, and havingthen little weight, a less firm mode of adhesion to the column thanbecomes requisite at a subsequent period, being then sufficient, wedo not find more than one joint lodged in a socket, or concave impressionon the column ; but when increase of size renders a strongersupport necessary, two or three succeeding joints of the side armsbecome imbedded in this socket, (for which its extension as alreadynoticed allows room) and these joints instead of being arranged in aseries branching off at right angles from the column, become oblique,their direction inclining upwards, so as to aid in bearing the additionalweight. The first joint of the side arms, where thus obliquelyinserted in the columnar socket, have that portion of their circumferencewhich is presented towards the upper part of the column,truncated, in such a curve as may fit them to the concavity of theimpression where they rest against it.The surface of these joints, which fit into the columnar impressionissmooth, being destined for adhesion only, but the articulating surfacebetween the contiguous joints, where motion also is to be allowed,exhibits the usual mechanism of radiated ridges and furrows. Thesejoints are convex on the side nearest the column, and concave on thatmost remote."G. II. G02 EXPLANATION OF PLATES 48. 49.Tubercles which appear on the surface of Fig. 6.(Original.)X.

Thomson has more recently conjecturedthat the Pentacrinus Europe's, which in early lifeis fixed by its stem to other bodies, is producedfrom the ovum of the Comatula, and becomes afterwardsdetached, and forms a perfect Comatula, capableof moving freely in the Ocean ; at one timecrawling amongst sub-marine Plants, at others floating,or swimming like Medusae.

The principle of this mechanismis the same as in Pentacrinites subangularis, PL52, Figs. 4, 5, and in Encrinites moniliformis, PL49, Figs. 3, 4 ; but the circular form of the columnin the latter, causes the smallest plate, c, to bevisible around its entire circumference. See V. I.p. 435, Note. (Original.)The bases of two side arms are seen in two of thegrooves, articulating with the uppermost large jointof this column.

Fragment of the bark on the trunk of a Sigillaria,from Earl Fitzwilliam's coal mine at Elsikar, nearRotherham. In this mine many large trunks areseen inclined in all directions, and some nearly vertical.(See V. I. p. 470, Note.) The bark is convertedinto a thin lamina of coal, and remains attached tothe lower portion of this specimen. It exhibits onits outer surface scars formed by the articulationsof the bases of leaves ; these are penetrated neartheir centre by three apertures for vessels thatpassed from each leaf into the trunk. The decorticatedupper part of this specimen presents an impressionof its striated internal surface, and exhibitsbeneath each scale two oblong parallel apertures,through which the vessels from a leaf penetratedthe trunk. Scale one-half. (Original.)The substance of the trunk must have been inastate of decay, before the mud, which is now hardenedinto shale, could have entered the interior ofthe bark. When trunks of this kind are inclinedat an angle exceeding 45Â°, they are usually distendedwith sandstone, or sandy shale; when at aless angle than 45Â°, they are most commonly compressed,and have only a thin flat portion of shale,formed of indurated mud within their bark. Thebark, wherever it has not perished, is converted tocoal.2'. Articulating leaf-scar on the exterior of the bark ofanother large trunk of Sigillaria from Elsecar. Nat.M. Ad.

On comparing this scar with those upon thebark of Fig. 2, it may be seen that the differentmodes of articulation of the leaves with the corticalintegument present obvious characters, on whichspecific distinctions may perhaps most easily beestablished, in this very obscure and curious familyof extinct plants. See various figures of these leaf-scarsin Lindley and Hutton's Fossil Flora, Plates55. 56. 51. 71. 72. &c. In Figs. 2, and 2', as inmany other species, decurrent lines are visible onboth sides of the scar. (Original.)Fig. 3. Ulodendron Allan, (nobis) scale one-fifth.See Vii. p. 475. Note. Drawn from a plaster castof an impression on sandstone, in the Museum ofthe Royal Society of Edinburgh from the Coal formationat Craigleith. This sandstone has formeda natural mould on the outer surface of a stem,which has entirely perished ; our cast gives a facsimileof the small rhomboidal scales, and of threelarge round scars on the exterior of the trunk.This impression has been figured, in an invertedposition, by Mr. Allan in Vol. IX. Trans. RoyalSoc. Edin. 1823. PL XIV. p. 236. (Original.)Our figure represents the trunk in its naturalposition. In the centre of each scar is a cavity,indicating the place of attachment of a cone. Theupper portion of each scar is marked with furrows,produced by pressure of the long radiating scalesat the bottom of the cone. This pressure hasnearly obliterated the smaller rhomboidal scales ofthe bark, in those parts where the furrows aredeepest; on the lower portion of the scars, thescales of the bark have been but slightly modifiedby pressure of the cone.EXPLANATION OF PLATE 56. 93Fig. 4. A single scar formed by the attachment of a coneof another species, Ulodendron Lucas, (nobis) discoveredby Mr. Lucas in the S. Wales Coal fieldnear Swansea. Some scales and speared-shapedleaves of the trunk are still preserved around the marginof this scar. As the bark has fallen off, we haveonly the impression of its inner surface. This surfaceexhibits small apertures, through which vesselsentered from beneath the bark-scales into the trunk.On the upper part of the disk, the traces of manyof these vessels have been obliterated by pressureof the cone. Scale one-fourth. (Original.)Fig. 5. Ulodendron Stokes. (nobis) A large oval scar,(4j inches in its longer, and 3j inches in its shorterdiameter) preserved in shale from an unknown localityin the English Coal Formation. On themargin of this scar are the remains of rhomboidalscales, and impressions of scales, and a few smallleaves. Within the disk a few fragments only ofthe bark remain near its upper margin. Near itscentre, is the mark of the insertion of the stem ofa large cone. The lower half exhibits a series ofsmall tubular cavities, marking the place of vessels.which passed from the bark into the trunk, onebeneath each of the bark-scales that have fallen off.In the upper half of the Scar, there are but slighttraces of these cavities, and the surface is markedwith furrows, produced by pressure of the longradiating scales of the base of the cone. Scale one-fifth.(Original.)Fig. 6. Ulodendron Rhodii. (nobis) Scar on a scalystem, from the Coal field of Silesia, figured by Rhodein his Beverage sur PJtanzenkunde der Vowels, L.2. PI. 3. Fig. 1. The lower portion of this Scar94 EXPLANATION OF PLATE 56.retains the bark-scales modified by pressure of theTroilus or cone that grew from the centre of thedisk. The upper portion of the Scar is without indicationsof bark-scales, and is covered with radiatingfurrows, impressed on it by the long slenderscales of the base of the Troilus, which have obliteratedthe bark-scales.*The character of this scar approaches to that ofFig. 5, but its proportions differ, measuring 3 Jinches in the longer, and 2i inches in the shorterdiameter. The scaly bark (which in Fig. 5 hasbeen almost entirely removed from the area of thescar), is preserved on the lower portion of the diskof Fig. 6. Scale two-ninths. (Original.)Fig. 6'. Cast of Ulodendron Conybearii (nobis) formedby Pennant sandstone of the Coal formation atStapleton near Bristol. This cast expresses theexact form of an oval scar, or cavity on a stemfrom which a cone had fallen off.The disk is covered with slight ridges and furrows,radiating in all directions from the point of insertionof the cone, and formed by pressure of itslowest scales upon the portion of the stem to whichit was attached. Beneath the point of insertion, aThe portions above and below the line drawn across Fig. 6, arecopied from two scars in Rhode's figure. Rhode considers theseimpressions to be flowers, and the compressed bark-scales to be thePetioles of the flower, and has represented the trunk in an invertedposition.As, in every species of Ulodendron which we have seen, the furrowsproduced by scales at the base of the cone, are deepest on theupper portion of the Scar, we infer from this circumstance that thecones were inclined upwards and inwards, with their axis approximatingto that of the stem from which they issued.EXPLANATION OF PLATE 56. 95few small scales of the bark remain adhering to theSandstone. Scale one-fourth. (Original.)Fig. 7. Portion of the Trunk of Favularia, one-fourthnat. size. This plant is distinguished by the tessellatedappearance of the scales, which cover the spacebetween each fluting of the Bark. In the centre ofthe area of each scale is a club-shaped scar, whichgave origin to a leaf; it was a dicotyledonous plant,probably allied to Sigillaria; and its stem musthave been covered with a mass of densely imbricatedfoliage. In the Genus Sigillaria the leaves weremore distant from one another. The Rows of scarsare separated by a groove, Fig. 7. b. ; their dispositionin the vertical direction is indicated by theline a. (Lindley, Foss. Fl. PL 73.)Fig. 8. Reduced from Lindley and Hutton's figure (PI.31) of the central portion of a Stigmaria ficoides,from Shale in the roof of the Jarrow colliery nearNewcastle. We have here a view of the inferiorsurface of this curious plant. Its dome-shapedhollow central trunk, or stem, was three feet indiameter, and fitted to sustain horizontally in afloating position the numerous long branches bywhich it was surrounded ; these divide into two, ata certain distance from the Trunk. When perfect,and floating in water, its appearance must haveresembled the form of an Asturias. On the twolongest branches, a. b. is seen the longitudinal depression,which is usually adjacent to the smallinternal woody axis of these branches, and from itsposition in this fossil, we learn that the place ofthis depression was on the inferior surface of eachbranch.

Xxiii The advantagesThe lower and richest beds of this Coal district are not onlyraised to the surface, and rendered easily accessible around the externalmargin of the basin, but are also brought within reach inconsequenceof another important elevation, along an anticlinal line,running nearly E. and W. through a considerable portion of theinterior of the basin, in the direction of its longer diameter.t I feel it a public duty to make known an act of Mr. Buddie,which will entitle him to the gratitude of posterity, and has set anexample, which, if generally followed in all extensive collieries, willsave the lives of thousands of unfortunate miners, that must otherwiseperish for want of information which can, at this time, be easilyrecorded for their preservation. This eminent Engineer and CoalViewer has presented to the Natural History Society of Newcastle,EXPLANATION OF PLATE 67. 105resulting from these Interruptions of the continuityof the strata are pointed out in pp. 543, 544.A large portion of the surface of these stratanear Newcastle is covered with a thick bed ofdiluvial Clay interspersed with Pebbles, in themanner represented at the top of this Section. Theeffect of this Clay must be to exclude much rainwaterthat would have percolated downwards intothe Coal mines, had strata of porous Sandstoneformed the actual surface.Plate 67. V. I. p. 559.Fig. 1. represents the case of a valley of Denudation instratified rocks, terminated abruptly by a cliff oncopies of his most important plans and sections, accompanied bywritten documents, of the under ground workings in the Collieriesnear that town, in which all those spaces are carefully noted, fromwhence the Coal has been extracted. Every practical Miner is toowell acquainted with the danger of approaching ancient workings inconsequenceof the accumulation of water in those parts from whichCoal has been removed. The sudden irruption of this water into amine adjacent to such reservoirs is occasionally attended with mostcalamitous and fatal results. See History of Fossil Fuel, the Collieriesand Coal Trade, 1835. P. 249 et seq.The dictates of humanity which prompt us to aid in the preservationof human life, no less than the economical view of renderingavailable at a future time the residuary portions of our beds ofCoal, which will not now repay the cost of extracting them, shouldinduce all proprietors and other persons connected with Coal Mines,and especially Engineers and Coal Viewers, to leave to their successorsa legacy, which will to them be precious, by preserving minuteand exact records of the state of the coal in their respective districts.It can, however, scarcely be expected, that such measures will begenerally and systematically adopted throughout the many Coalfieldsof this country, unless the subject be legislatively taken up bythose official persons, whom it behoves, as guardians of the futurewelfare of the nation, to institute due measures, whilst the opportunitiesexist, for preventing that loss of life and property, which alittle attention bestowed in season, will preserve to posterity.106 EXPLANATION OF PLATE 67.the sea-shore; this figure is intended to illustratetwo causes of the production of Springs by descentof water from porous strata at higher levels; thefirst, producing discharges in vallies of Denudation,along the line of junction of porous with impermeablestrata ; the other, by the interruption offeredto descent of water by Faults that intersect thestrata.The Hills A, C, are supposed to be formed of apermeable stratum a, a\ ci resting on an impermeablebed of Clay b, b', b". Between these twoHills is a Valley of Denudation, B. Towards thehead of this Valley the junction of the permeablestratum a, a', with the Clay bed b, b ', produces aspring at the point S. ; here the intersection ofthese strata by the denudation of the valley affordsa perennial issue to the Rain water, which fallsupon the adjacent upland plain, and percolatingdownwards to the bottom of the porous stratum a, a',accumulates therein until it is discharged by numeroussprings, in positions similar to S, near the headand along; the sides of the vallies which intersectthe junction of the stratum a, d, with the stratumb,V. See V. I. p. 559.*The Hill C, represents the case of a spring producedby a Fault, H. The Rain that falls uponthis Hill between H, and D, descends through theporous stratum a", to the subjacent bed of Clay b".The term Combe, so common in the names of upland Villages,is usually applied to that unaltered portion of a valley, which formsits continuation beyond, and above the most elevated spring that issuesinto it ; at this point, or spring head, the valley ends, and the Combebegins. The conveniences of water and shelter which these spring-headsafford, have usually fixed the site of the highest villages thatare planted around the margin of elevated plains.EXPLANATION OF PLATE 67. 107The inclination of this bed directs its course towardsthe Fault H, where its progress is interceptedby the dislocated edge of the Clay bed b ' , and aspring is formed at the point f. Springs originatingin causes of this kind are of very frequent occurrence,and are easily recognized in cliffs upon thesea-shores In inland districts, the fractures whichcause these springs are usually less apparent, andthe issues of water often give to the Geologist noticeof Faults, of which the form of the surface affordsno visible indication.

Themean direction of the greatest number of them isnearly from E. N. E. to W. S. W. They are intersectednearly at right angles by other and less numerousVeins called Cross Courses, the contentsof which usually differ from those of the E. andW. veins, and are seldom metalliferous.The Granite and Kills and other rocks whichintersect them, e. g. Dykes and intruded masses ofmore recent Granite, and of various kinds of porphyriticrocks called El vans (see PI. I, a 9. b. c.)are considered to have occupied their present relativepositions, before the origin of the fissures,which form the metalliferous Veins, that intersectthem all. (SeeVV. I. p. 550.)*In Vol. I. P. 552, Note, a reference is made to some importantobservations by Mr. R. W. Fox on the Electro-magnetic actionswhich are now going on in the mines of Cornwall, as being likely tothrow important light on the manner in which the ores have been introducedto metallic veins.The following observations by the same gentleman in a recentcommunication to the Geological Society of London, (April, 1836,)appear to contain the rudiments of a Theory, which, when maturelydeveloped, promises to offer a solution of this difficult and complexProblem.If it be admitted that fissures may have been produced by changesin the temperature of the earth, there can be little difficulty in alsoadmitting that electricity may have powerfully influenced the existingarrangement of the contents of mineral veins. How are we otherwiseto account for the relative positions of veins of different kindswith respect to each other, and likewise of their contents in referenceto the rocks which they traverse, and many other phenomena ob-explanationOF PLATE 68. 109Plate 68.

Copper, Tin, Iron, and Zinc, in combinationwith the sulphuric and muriatic acids, being very soluble in water,are, in this state, capable of conducting voltaic electricity ; so, if bymeans of infiltration, or any other process, we suppose the waterto have been impregnated with any of these metallic salts, therocks containing different salts would undoubtedly become in differentor opposite electrical conditions ; and hence, if there were noother cause, electric currents would be generated, and be readilytransmitted through the fissures containing water with salts in solution; and decompositions of the salts and a transference of theirelements, in some cases, to great distances, would be the natural result.But, on the known principles of Electro-magnetism, it is evidentthat such currents would be more or less influenced in theirdirection and intensity by the magnetism of the earth. They cannot,for instance, pass from N. to S. or from S. to N. so easily as fromE. to W. but more so than from W. to E. The terrestrial magnetismwould therefore tend, in a greater or less degree, to direct thevoltaic currents through those fissures which might approximate toan east and west bearing, and in separating the saline constituents,would deposit the metal within or near the electro-negative rock,and the acid would be determined towards the electro-positive rock,and probably enter new combinations. Or, the sulphuric acid might,by means of the same agency, be resolved into its elements ; in whichcase the sulphur would take the direction of the metal, and the oxygenof the acid, and in this way, the metallic sulphurets may haveprobably their origin ; for, if I mistake not, the metallic sulphates,supposing them to have been the prevailing salts, as at present,would be fully adequate to supply all the sulphur required by thesame metals to form sulphurets ; indeed more than sufficient, if wededuct the oxyde of tin, and other metalliferous oxydes found in ourmines. The continued circulation of the waters would, in time,bring most of the soluble salts under the influence of these currents,till the metals were in great measure separated from their solvents,110 EXPLANATION OF PLATE 69.Plate 69.

(Hericart de Thurn.)and deposited in the East and West veins, and near the rocks towhich they were determined by the electric currents'In a Letter to the Author upon this subject (June 29, 1836), Mr.Fox further remarks.It should be observed that in proportion as the deposition of themetals proceeded, the voltaic action must necessarily have beenconsiderably augmented, so as to render it highly probable that themetals were chiefly deposited at rather an early period in the historyof the containing veins ; and their intersection by other veins seemsto strengthen this probability."Mr. Fox has found by experiment that when a solution of muriateof Tin is placed in the voltaic current, a portion of the metal is determinedtowards the negative pole, whilst another portion in thestate of an oxide passes to the positive pole. This fact appears tohim to afford a striking illustration of the manner in which Tin andCopper have been separated from each other in the same vein, or incontiguous veins, whilst these metals also very commonly occur togetherin the same vein.INDEX.Acrodus, a genus of fossil sharks, i.288.Actinocrinites, 30-dactylus, Miller'srestoration of, i. 429.Adapts, character and place of, i. 82.Agassiz, his recognition of the scales offishes in coprolites, i. 191 ; on causesof the death of fishes, i. 122 ; on originof colonies, i. 200 ; on Glaris turtle,i. 257 ; his classification of fishes,i. 268; documents consigned to himby Cuvier, i. 267 ; his new orders offishes, i. 269, 270 ; geological resultsestablished by, i. 272, 273;his new arrangement of Monte Bolcafishes, i. 285 ; his discovery of be-samniteswith ink bags, i. 374 ; onthe bilateral structure of radiated animals,i. 415.Agnostus, a genus of trilobites, i. 391.Aichstadt, pterodactyles found at, i.221.Aix, fossil fishes of, i. 285.Allan, Mr., his paper on Antrim be-samnites,i. 377.Amber, fossil resin from lignite, i. 520.Amblypterus, fossil genus of fishes, i.278.Ammonites, formed by cephalopodousmollusks, i. 333 ; characteristic ofdifferent formations, i. 333 ; geologicaldistribution of, i. 334 ; geographicalditto, i. 335 ; extent and numberof species, i. 334 ; size of, i. 334 ;sub-genera of, i. 334 ; shell composedof three parts, i. 336 ; externalshells, i. 337, 338 ; outer chambercontained the animal, i. 337 â€”339 ; double functions of shell, i.338 ; contrivances to strengthenshells, i. 339â€”344; ribs, architecturaldisposition of, i. 341 ; transverseplates, use of their foliated edges, i. 344349; compound internal arches, i.349 ; siphuncle, organ of hydraulicadjustment, i. 350, 351 ; siphuncle,occasional state of preservation, i.351, 352 ; siphuncle, placed differentlyfrom that of nautili, i. 353 ;siphuncle, Dr. Prout's analysis of,i. 352 ; air chambers, more complexin ammonites than in nautili, i. 350:ammonites, how different from nautili,353 ; Von Buch's theory of, i.352 ; uses of lobes and saddles in,i. 354; concluding observations upon,i. 355 â€” 357 ; probable place of heartin, ii. 58.Anarchists, palatal teeth of, i. 281.Animals, final cause of their creation,i. 101 ; lower classes of, predominatein earlier strata, i. 115 ; extinctraces, how connected with existingspecies, i. 581 ; causes of their suddendestruction, i. 122 ; small numberadapted for domestication, i. 100 ;terrestrial, how buried in strata offresh water and marine formation, i.128.Animal enjoyment, one great object ofcreation, i. 293, 301.Animal kingdom, four great divisions of,coeval, i. 61 ; early relations of, i. 87.Animal life, extent of upon our globe,i. 102; progressive stages of, i. 115 ;remains of in secondary strata, i. 72.Animal remains, most instructive evidencesin geology, i. 128 ; preservedchiefly by agency of water, i. 126.Annelidans, fossil remains of, i. 387.Anning, Miss, her discovery of ink bagwithin horny sheath of belemnite, i.374 ; her discoveries at Lyme Regis,passim ; her observations on connectionof lignite with pentacrinites nearLyme, i. 437 ; her discovery of fossilpens and ink bags of Loligo, i. 304.Anoplotherium, character and place of,i. 81.Anstice, Mr. W., his discovery of insectsin coal formation, i. 405 ; ,&c. found in CoalbrookDale, by, ii. 43.Ant eater, humerus like that of megatherium,i. 154.Anthracotherium, character and placeof, i. 82.Apiocrinites, or pear encrinite, Miller'srestoration of, i. 428.Arachnidans, two great families of,found fossil, i. 405.Aragon, M., on expenditure of rainwater,i. 557 ; on Artesian wells inFrance, i. 564.INDEX.Araucaria, fossil in coal formation, i.486 ; peculiarity in structure of, i.486; fossil trunks near Edinburgh,i. 487; fossil in Lias, i. 487 ; localitiesof living species, i. 488.Argonauts, its origin still doubtful, i.313.Armadillo, habit and distribution of, i.144 ; fore foot of, adapted for diggingas in the megatherium, i. 154 ; bonyarmour resembling that of megatherium,i. 160â€”162.Artesian wells, method of obtaining,i. 561. 568 ; examples of action of,i. 562 ; where most available, i. 563 ;cause of rise water in, i. 564 â€” 567 ;temperature of water in, i. 567 ; extensiveapplication of, i. 568 ; Chinesemanner of boring without rods,i. 568 ; great importance of, i. 569.Articulate, earliest examples of, i. 62 ;remains of fossil, i. 386 ; four classesin all fossiliferous formations, i. 412 ;changes in families of, i. 412.Artois, artificial fountains in, i. 562 â€”566.Asaph us, i. 391.Asaphus caudatus, fossil eyes "of, i.398.Aspidorhynchus, i. 276.Asterophyllites, abundant in coal, i.479.
