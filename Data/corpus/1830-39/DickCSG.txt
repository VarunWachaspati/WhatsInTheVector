NOAKES.Oh! nonsense! — Tell him to go into the commercial room.third w.I told him so, ma'am, but the Strange Gentleman says he willhave a private apartment, and that it's as much as his life isworth, to sit in a public room.MRS. NOAKES.As much as his life is worth ?third w.Yes, ma'am. — Gentleman says he doesn't care if it's a darkcloset ; but a private room of some kind he must and will have.MRS. NOAKES.Very odd. — Did you ever see him before, Will ?third w.No, ma'am ; he's quite a stranger here. — He's a wonderful manto talk, ma'am — keeps on like a steam engine. Here he is, ma'am.Strange Gentleman (without).Now don't tell me, because that's all gammon and nonsense;and gammoned I never was, and never will be, by any waiter thatever drew the breath of life, or a cork. — And just have the goodnessto leave my portmanteau alone, because I can carry it verywell myself ; and show me a private room without further delay;for a private room I must and will have.— Damme, do you thinkI'm going to be murdered ! —[Enter the three Waiters, c. door — they form down L. H., theStrange Gentleman following, carrying hisjportman tea aand great-coat.There — this room will do capitally well. Quite the thing, — justthe fit. — How are you, ma'am ? I suppose you are the landladyof this place ? Just order those very attentive young fellows out,will you, and I'll order dinner.b 24 THE STRANGE GENTLEMAN.mrs. noakes (to Waiters).You may leave the room.STRANGE G.Hear that ? — You may leave the room. Make yourselvesscarce. Evaporate — disappear — come.[Exit Waiters, c. DOOR.That's right. And now, madam, while we're talking over thisimportant matter of dinner, I'll just secure us effectually againstfurther intrusion. (Bolts the door.)MRS. NOAKES.Lor, sir ! Bolting the door, and me in the room !STRANGE G.Don't be afraid — I won't hurt you. I have no designs againstyou, my dear ma'am : but / must be private. (Sits on the portmanteau,R. H.)MRS. NOAKES.Well, sir — I have no objection to break through our rules foronce; but it is not our way, when we're full, to give private roomsto solitary gentlemen, who come in a gig, and bring only oneportmanteau. You're quite a stranger here, sir. If I'm notmistaken, it's your first appearance in this house.STRANGE G.You're right, ma'am. It is my first, my very first — but notmy last, I can tell you.MRS. NOAKES.No?STRANGE G.No (looking round him). I like the look of this place. Snugand comfortable — neat and lively. You'll very often find me atthe St. James's Arms, I can tell you, ma'am.MRS. noakes (aside).A civil gentleman. Are you a stranger in this town, sir ?STRANGE G.Stranger ! Bless you, no. I have been here for many yearspast, in the season.MRS. NOAKES.Indeed !THE STRANGE GENTLEMAN. 5STRANGE G.Oh, yes. Put up at the Royal Hotel regularly, for a longtime; but I was obliged to leave it at last.MRS. NOAKES.I have heard a good many complaints of it.STRANGE G.terrible ! such a noisy house.MRS. NOAKES.Ah!STRANGE G.Shocking! Din, din, din — Drum, drum, drum, all night.Nothing but noise, glare, and nonsense. I bore it a long timefor old acquaintance sake ; but what do you think they did atlast, ma'am ?MRS. NOAKES.1 can't guess.STRANGE G.Turned the fine Old Assembly Room into a stable, and tookto keeping horses. I tried that too, but I found I couldn'tstand it ; so I came away, ma'am, and — and — here I am (rises).MRS. NOAKES.And I'll be bound to say, sir, that you will have no cause tocomplain of the exchange.STRANGE G.I'm sure not, ma'am ; I know it — I feel it, already.MRS. NOAKES.About dinner, sir ; what would you like to take ?STRANGE G.Let me see ; will you be good enough to suggest something,ma'am ?MRS. NOAKES.Why, a broiled fowl and mushrooms is a very nice dish.STRANGE G.You are right, ma'am ; a broiled fowl and mushrooms formavery delightful and harmless amusement, either for one or twopersons. Broiled fowl and mushrooms let it be, ma'am.THE STRANGE GENTLEMAN.MRS. NOAKES.In about an hour, I suppose, sir ?STRANGE G.For the second time, ma'am, you have anticipated my feelings.MRS. NOAKES.You'll want a bed to-night, I suppose, sir ; perhaps you'd liketo see it ? Step this way, sir, and — (going l. h.)STRANGE G.No, no, never mind. (Aside.) This is a plot to get me outof the room. She's bribed by somebody who wants to identifyme. I must be careful ; I am exposed to nothing but artificeand stratagem. Never mind, ma'am, never mind.MRS. NOAKES.If you'll give me your portmanteau, sir, the Boots will carryit into the next room for you.strange G. (aside).Here's diabolical ingenuity; she thinks it's got the name uponit. (To her.) I'm very much obliged to the Boots for hisdisinterested attention, ma'am, but with your kind permissionthis portmanteau will remain just exactly where it is ; consequently,ma'am, (with great warmth,)if the aforesaid Bootswishesto succeed in removing this portmanteau, he must previouslyremove me, ma'am, me; and it will take a pair of very stoutBoots to do that, ma'am, I promise you.MRS. NOAKES.Dear me, sir, you needn't fear for your portmanteau in thishouse ; I dare say nobody wants it.STRANGE G.I hope not, ma'am, because in that case nobody will be disappointed.(Aside.) How she fixes her old eyes on me !MRS. noakes (aside).I never saw such an extraordinary person in all my life. Whatcan he be ? (Looks at him very hard.)[Exit MRS. NOAKES, C. DOOR.STRANGE G.She's gone at last ! Now let me commune with my owndreadful thoughts, and reflect on the best means of escapingTHE STRANGE GENTLEMAN. 7from my horrible position. (Takes a letter from his pocket.)Here's an illegal death warrant ; a pressing invitation to beslaughtered ; a polite request just to step out and be killed,thrust into my hand by some disguised assassin in a dirty blackcalico jacket, the very instant I got out of the gig at the door.I know the hand ; there's a ferocious recklessness in the cross tothis "T," and a baleful malignity in the dot of that "I," whichwarns me that it comes from my desperate rival. (Opens it, andreads.) " Mr. Horatio Tinkles " — that's him — " presents his complimentsto his enemy" — that's me — "and requests the pleasure ofhis company tomorrow morning, under the clump of trees, onCorpse Common," — Corpse Common ! — " to which any of thetown's people will direct him, and where he hopes to have dissatisfactionof giving him his gruel." — Giving him his gruel !Ironical cut-throat ! — " His punctuality will be esteemed a personalfavour, as it will save Mr. Tinkles the trouble and inconvenienceof calling with a horsewhip in his pocket. Mr.Tinkles has ordered breakfast at the Royal for one. It is paidfor. The individual who returns alive, can eat it. Pistols —half past five — precisely." — Blood-thirsty miscreant! The individualwho returns alive ! I have seen him hit the painted manat the shooting gallery, regularly every time in his centre shirtplait, except when he varied the entertainments, by lodging theball playfully in his left eye. Breakfast! I shall want nothingbeyond the gruel. What's to be done ? Escape ! I can't escape ;concealment's of no use, he knows I am here. He has dodgedme all the way from London, and will dodge me all the way tothe residence of Miss Emily Brown, whom my respected, butswine-headed, parents have picked out for my future wife. Apretty figure I should cut before the old people, whom I havenever beheld more than once in my life, and Miss Emily Brown,whom I have never seen at all, if I went down there, pursued bythis Salamander, who I suppose is her accepted lover! Whatis to be done? I can't go back again ; father would be furious.What can be done ? nothing ! (Sinks into a chair.) I mustundergo this fiery ordeal, and submit be packed up, and carriedback to my weeping parents, like an unfortunate buck, with a8 THE STRANGE GENTLEMAN.flat piece of lead in my head, and a brief epitaph on my breast,"Killed on Wednesday morning." No, I won't, (starting up, andwalking about). I won't submit to it ; I'll accept the challenge,but first I'll write an anonymous letter to the local authorities,giving them information of this intended duel, and desiring themto place me under immediate restraint. That's feasible ; onfurther consideration, it's capital. My character will be savedI shall be bound over — he'll he bound over — I shall resumemy journey — reach the house — marry the girl — pocket thefortune, and laugh at him. No time to be lost ; it shall be doneforthwith. (Goes to table, and writes.) There; the challengeaccepted, with a bold defiance, that'll look very have when itcomes to be printed. No w for the other. (Writes.) " To theMayor — Sir — A strange Gentleman at the St. James's Arms,whose name is unknown to the writer of this communication, isbent upon committing a rash and sanguinary act, at an earlyhour tomorrow morning. As you value human life, secure theamiable youth, without delay. Think, I implore you, sir,think what would be the feelings of those to whom he nearestand dearest, if any mischance bes al the interesting young man.Do not neglect this solemn warning ; the number of his room isseventeen." There — (folding &£>). Now if I can find any onewho will deliver it secretly. —Tom Sparks, with a pair of hoots in his hand, peeps in aithe c. d.TOM.Are these here yo&r'n ?STRANGE G.No.TOM.Oh ! (going baric),STRANGE G.Hallo ! stop, are you the Boots ?TOM (still at the door).I'm the head o' that branch o' the establishment. There'sanother man under me, as brushes the dirt off, and puts theTHE STRANGE GENTLEMAN. 9blacking on. The fancy work's my department ; I do thepolishing, nothing else.STRANGE G.You are the upper Boots, then ?TOM.Yes, I'm the regular ; t'other one's only the deputy ; top bootsand half boots, I calls us.STRANGE G.You're a sharp fellow.TOM.Ah ! I'd better cut then (going).STRANGE G.Don't hurry, Boots — don't hurry ; I want you. (Rises, andcomes forward, r. h.)tom (coming forward, L. H.).Well !STRANGE G.Can — can — you be secret, Boots ?TOM.That depends entirely on accompanying circumstances ; — seethepoint ?STRANGE G.I think I comprehend your meaning, Boots. You insinuatethat you could be secret (putting his hand in his pocket) if youhad — five shillings for instance — isn't that it, Boots ?TOM.That's the line o' argument I should take up ; but that an'texactly my meaning.STRANGE G.No!TOM.No. A secret's a thing as is always a rising to one's lips. Itrequires an astonishing weight to keep one on 'em down.STRANGE G.Ah!TOM.Yes ; I don't think I could keep one snug — regular snug, youknow.10 THE STRANGE GENTLEMAN.STRANGE G.Yes, regularly snug, of course.TOM.If it had a less weight a-top on it, than ten shillings.STRANGE G.You don't think three half-crowns would do it ?TOM.It might, I won't say it wouldn't, but I couldn't warrant it.STRANGE G.You could the other !TOM.Yes.STRANGE G.Then there it is. (Giveshim four half-crowns.) You see theseletters ?TOM.Yes, I can manage that without my spectacles.STRANGE G.Well ; that's to be left at the Royal Hotel. This, this, is ananonymous one ; and I want it to be delivered at the mayor'shouse, without his knowing from whom it came, or seeing whodelivered it.TOM (taking the letters).I say — you're a rum 'un, you are.STRANGE G.Think so ! Ha, ha ! so are you.TOM.Aye, but you're a rummer one than me.STRANGE G.No, no, that's your modesty.TOM.No it an't. I say, how veil you did them last hay-stacks.How do you contrive that ere now, if it's a fair question. Is itdone with a pipe, or do you use them Lucifer boxes ?STRANGE G.Pipe — Lucifer boxes — hay-stacks! Why, what do you mean?tom (looking cautiously round).I know your name, old 'un.THE STRANGE GENTLEMAN. 11STRANGE G.You know my name ! (Aside.) Now how the devil has hegot hold of that, I wonder !TOM.Yes, I know it. It begins with a " S."STRANGE G.Begins with an S !TOM.And ends with a " G " (winking). We've all heard talk ofSwing down here.STRANGE G.Heard talk of Swing ! Here's a situation ! Damme, d'ye thinkI'm a walking carbon of vitriol, and burn every thing I touch?Will you go upon the errand you're paid for ?TOM.Oh, I'm going — I'm going. It's nothing to me, you know; Idon't care. I'll only just give these boots to the deputy, to takethem to whoever they belong to, and then I'll pitch this hereletter in at the Mayor's office-window, in no time.STRANGE G.Will you be off ?TOM.Oh, I'm going, I'm going. Close, you knows, close !exit Tom, c. door.STRANGE G.In five minutes more the letter will be delivered ; in anotherhalf hour, if the Mayor does his duty, I shall be in custody, andsecure from the vengeance of this infuriated monster. I wonderwhether they'll take me away? Egad! I may as well be providedwith a clean shirt and a night-cap in case. Let's see, she saidthe next room was my bed-room, and as I have accepted thechallenge, I may venture so far now. (Shouldering the portmanteau.)What a capital notion it is ; there'll be all the correspondencein large letters, in the county paper, and my namefiguring away in roman capitals, with a long story, how I wassuch a desperate dragon, and so bent upon fighting, that it tookfour constables to carry me to the Mayor, and one boy to carry12 THE STRANGE GENTLEMAN.»my hat. It's a capital plan — must be clone — the only way Ihave of escaping pursued from this place, unless I could putmyself in the General Post, and direct myself to a friend in town.And then it's a chance whether they'd take me in, being so muchover weight.[Exit Strange Gentleman, with portmanteau, l. h.Mrs. Noakes, peeping in c. door, then entering.MRS. NOAKES.This is the room, ladies, but the gentleman has stepped outsomewhere, he won't be long, I dare say. Pray come in, Miss.Enter Mary and Fanny Wilson, c. door.MARY (C.).This is the Strange Gentleman's apartment, is it ?MRS. noakes (r.).Yes, Miss ; shall I see if I can find him, ladies, and tellhim you are here ?MARY.No ; we should prefer waiting till he returns, if you please.MRS. NOAKES.Very well, ma'am. He'll be back directly, I dare say ; for it'svery near his dinner time.[Exit Mrs. Noakes, c. door.MARY.Come, Fanny, dear; don't give way to these feelings of depression.Take pattern by me — I feel the absurdity of oursituation acutely ; but you see that I keep up, nevertheless.FANNY.It is easy for you to do so. Your situation is neither so embarrassing,nor so painful a one as mine.MARY.Well, my dear, it may not be, certainly; but the circumstanceswhich render it less so are, I own, somewhat incomprehensibleto me. My hare-brained, mad-cap swain, John Johnson, imploresme to leave my guardian's house, and accompany him on anTHE STRANGE GENTLEMAN. 13expedition to Gretna Green. I with immense reluctance, andafter considerable pressing —FANNY.Yield a very willing consent.MARY.Well, we won't quarrel about terms ; at all events I doconsent. He bears me off, and when we get exactly half-way,discovers that his money is all gone, and that we must stop atthis Inn, until he can procure a remittance from London, bypost. I think, my dear, you'll own that this is rather an embarrassingposition.FANNY.Compare it with mine. Taking advantage of your flight, Isend express to my admirer, Charles Tomkins, to say that I haveaccompanied you ; first, because I should have been miserableif left behind with a peevish old man alone ; secondly, because Ithought it proper that your sister should accompany youMARY.And, thirdly, because you knew that he would immediatelycomply with this indirect assent to his entreaties of three months'duration, and follow you without delay, on the same errand.Eh, my dear?FANNY.It by no means follows that such was my intention, or that Iknew he would pursue such a course, but supposing he has doneso ; supposing this Strange Gentleman should be himself —MARY.Supposing ! — Why, you know it is. You told him not todisclose his name, on any account; and the Strange Gentlemanis not a very common travelling name, I should imagine ; besidesthe hasty note, in which he said he should join you here.FANNY.Well, granted that it is he. In what a situation am I placed.You tell me, for the first time, that my violent intended must onno account be beheld by your violent intended, just now, becauseof some old quarrel between them, of long standing, which hasnever been adjusted to this day. What an appearance this will14 THE STRANGE GENTLEMAN.have ! How am I to explain it, or relate your present situation ?I should sink into the earth with shame and confusion.MARY.Leave it to me. It arises from my heedlessness. I will takeit all upon myself, and see him alone. But tell me, my dear — asyou got up this love affair with so much secrecy and expeditionduring the four months you spent at Aunt Martha's, I haveneveryet seen Mr. Tomkins, you know. Is he so very handsome?FANNY.See him, and judge for yourself.MARY.Well, I will ; and you may retire, till I have paved the wayfor your appearance. But just assist me first, dear, in making alittle noise to attract his attention, if he really be in the nextroom, or I may wait here all day.DUET.A t end of which[Exit Fanny, c. door.

Oblige me by forwarding them tomy agent in the course of the week, and I free you from anyinterference in this little matter. (Crosses to L. H. and is going.)Overtop.Stay, Miss Dobbs,stay. As you say , we are old acquaintances,andthere certainly were some small sums of money, which — which —JULIA.Which certainly are still outstanding.Overtop.Just so, just so ; and which perhaps you would be likely toforget, if you had a husband — eh, Miss Dobbs, eh ?JULIA.I have little doubt that I should. If I gained one throughyour assistance, indeed — I can safely say I should forget allabout them.Overtop.My dear Miss Dobbs, we perfectly understand each other. —Pray proceed.JULIA.Well — dear Lord Peter —Overtop.That's the young man you're going to run away with, I presume?JULIA.That's the young nobleman who's going to run away with me,Mr. Overton.THE STRANGE GENTLEMAN. 21Overtop.Yes, just so. — I beg your pardon — pray go on.JULIA.Dear Lord Peter is young and wild, and the fact is, his friendsdo not consider him very sagacious or strong-minded. Toprevent their interference, our marriage is to be a secret one. Infact, he is stopping now at a friend's hunting seat in the neighbourhood; he is to join me here ; and we are to be married atGretna.Overtop.Just so. — A matter, as it seems to me, which you can concludewithout my interference.JULIA.Wait an instant. To avoid suspicion, and prevent our beingrecognised and followed, I settled with him that you should giveout in this house that he was a lunatic, and that I — his aunt — ■was going to convey him in a chaise, to-night, to a privateasylum at Berwick. I have ordered the chaise at half-past onein the morning. You can see him, and make our final arrangements.It will avert all suspicion, if I have no communicationwith him, till we start. You can say to the people of the housethat the sight of me makes him furious.Overtop.Where shall I find him ? — Is he here ?JULIA.You know best.Overtop.I!JULIA.I desired him, immediately on his arrival, to write you somemysterious nonsense, acquainting you with the number of hisroom.overton (producing a letter).Dear me ! he has arrived, Miss Dobbs.JULIA.No!22 THE STRANGE GENTLEMAN.Overtop.Yes — see here — a most mysterious and extraordinary composition,which was thrown in at my office window, this morning,and which I could make neither head nor tail of.
