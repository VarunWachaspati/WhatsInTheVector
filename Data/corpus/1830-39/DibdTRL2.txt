The Library.IN the third volume of The Bibliographical De-cameron,and in a note at the 388th page of thatsame volume, will be found the following passage :It was quite at the end of the month of May, in theyear 1811, that I paid my first visit to the Noble Owner ofthe residence under description. The day had been excessivelyhot, and I reached Althorp, from London, betweenthe hours of six and seven, to a late dinner. The sun wasthen beginning to decline, so as to cast a breadth of shadowfrom the long avenues of elm and beech, and lime, withwhich the back front of the house is adorned*, or enfiladed.Sitting on a seat beneath one of these elms the cawingof innumerable rooks from the adjoining avenues thetranquillity of the approaching evening the calm, clear,You approach the front of the house through avenues of oak, ofwhich some are indisputably proved to have been growing towards thelatter rnd of the reign of Henry VII.558 Author.and almost cloudless sky and (shall I dare avow it?) morethan either of these causes, or the whole of them collectively,the near and immediate view of a suite of rooms in whichwas contained the FINEST PRIVATE COLLECTION OF BOOKSPERHAPS IN EUROPE could not fail to produce emotionsof no ordinary occurrence, to one, who, for several previousyears, had vehemently sought after such a gratification.After a due time devoted to musing, I entered the aforesaidsuite of rooms, and more especially rested in that whereina fine Raphael was over the fire-place, and a French clockwas ticking upon the marble mantle-piece. The cloth waslaid, and the exemplification of the good old maxim (theusual theme of our school days) nil prater ordines wassingularly manifested to view. The sun was now sinkinglower and lower, and the shadows became proportionablybroad and massive. No sound was heard from without,save the nibbling of the deer, who quite peeped intothe windows of the apartment. His Lordship arrived atsevenI will conclude this i View of the Interior' (as theFlemish painters designate such subjects) by adding, thatthat congenial visit was the prelude to the many subsequentones which have taken place since the said 'year 1811.'But the mansion the library rejoins the impetuousreader ! I must be briefer than I could wish in satisfyingsuch impetuosity. Yet know, cultivator of bibliomanicalantiquities, that the name of SPENCER or Despencer (formerlythe same) is far from being barren in the annals ofbook-collecting ; for in the ancient time, Hugh Despencerhad a Son, Thomas, Earl of Gloucester, who, in 21 Rich.II., by petition in Parliament, obtained the revocation ofthe judgment of exile against his great grandfather, HughLe Despencer. In this petition it is stated (inter alia) thathe, the said Hugh, had at that time, Plate, Jewels, andready money better than 10,000/., xxxvi sacks of wool, anda LIBRARY OF Bores.' Collins, in his Baronetage, vol. i.SI/THORP.p. fl<)9, edit. 17'20, refers to Hot. Purl. *J1 Hie. II. n. .T>,60, 64,(*Now, if the reader pleases, he may contrast thissomewhat quaint, but " drawn on the spot," pictureof Althorp, with that which has been recently publishedin the pages of one of the most celebratedfemale writers of the day. Mrs. Jamieson's out-of-doorwinter view of Althorp shall speak foritself in the subjoined note*. Mine is a summer" It was on such a clay as I have seen in Italy in the month ofDecember, but which, in our chill climate, seemed so unseasonably, soominously beautiful, that it was like the hectic loveliness brighteningthe eyes and flushing the cheek of consumption, that I found myselfin the domains of Author. Autumn, dying in the lap of winter,looked out with one bright parting smile; the soft air breathed of summer;the withered leaves, heaped on the path, told a different tale. Theslant, pale sun shone out, with all heaven to himself: not a cloud wastin if, not a breeze to stir the leafless woods those venerable woodswhich Evelyn loved and commemorated. I was much struck with theinscription on a stone tablet, in a fine old wood near the house: ' thiswood was planted by Sir William Spencer, Knight of the Bath, in theyear of our Lord, 1624' on the other side, ( up and lee doing, andGod will prosper.' It is mentioned in Evelyn's ' Sylva.' The finemajestic old oaks, scattered over the park, tossed their huge bare armsagainst the blue sky ; a thin hoar frost, dissolving as the sun rose higher,left the lawns and hills sparkling and glancing in its ray ; and then ahare raced across the open gladeAnd with her feet she from the plashy earthchaises a mist, which, glittering in the sun,Runs with her all the way, wherever she 'doth run.'Nothing disturbed the serene stillness, except a pheasant whirring froma neighbouring thicket, or at intervals the telling of the deer, a soundw> peculiar, and so fitted to the scene, that I sympathised in the tasteof one of the noble progenitors of the Spencers, who had built a huntinglodge in a sequestered spot, that he might hear the harte bell.' Thiswas a day, an hour, a scene, with all its associations, its quietness, and560 Author.view. It is pleasing to tread the same ground, andto gaze upon many of the same objects, with a writerof the charm and power of Mrs. Jamieson's pen ;but at the expense of having my principles of chivalryquestioned, I must be permitted to break a tinylance with that " fair Lady," in commenting upona few defects of omission and commission whichseem to me to be involved in her description. Inthe first place, it is to be regretted that Mrs. Jamie-sonsuffered her agility of limbs, or buoyancy ofspirits, to carry her up the "great staircase" beforeshe had made the Tour "of all the rooms below ;"and most marvellous, or at least incomprehensible,to me, it is, that of a mansion, in which the FINESTPRIVATE LIBRARY IN EUROPE is contained andwhich library may be said to be nearer three thantwo hundred feet in length NO mention whateveris made !beauty, { felt in the blood, and felt along the heart.' All worldly caresand pains were laid asleep ; while memory, fancy, and feeling waked.Althorp does not frown upon us in the gloom of remote antiquity ; ithas not the warlike glories of some of the baronial residences of our oldnobility ; it is not built, like a watch tower, on a hill, to lord it overfeudal vassals ; it is not bristled with battlements and turrets. It standsin a valley, with the gradual hills undulating round it, clothed withrich woods. It has altogether a look of compactness and comfort, without pretension, which, with the pastoral beauty of the landscape, andlow situation, recall the ancient vocation of the family, whose grandeurwas first founded, like that of the patriarchs of old, on the multitude oftheir flocks and herds." Visits at Home and Abroad.A beautiful copper-plate vignette of this " UP AND BE DOING" Woodmay be seen in the Des Althorpiance, vol. i. p. 18, which had doubtlessescaped the recollection of Mrs. Jamieson.Author. ~>I51It is doubtless very possible that Mrs. Jamieson'slove of pictures and of portraits may be so muchthe ruling passion," as to " swallow up" everyparticle of interest or curiosity in the matter of1 JOKES ; and yet SHE, who has added to all ourLibraries by the production of one of the cleverestand most interesting " bones" of its kind*,ought, methinks, to have dropped more than onepassing courtesy as she glided by the interminableand glorious volumes of science, art, philosophy,belles-lettres, and Divinity, with* which the shelvesof Althorp are at once loaded and adorned. Butlet us keep to PICTURES. Let us suppose that, foran object not apparently developed, it was Mrs.Jamieson's exclusive wish to notice only the productionsof the pencil at Althorp. By not "gliding"through the library and by not beginning "atthe beginning" in the Dining Room she hasin fact lost the opportunity of exercising herivady and eloquent pen upon the best pn-t'trrsin the House. Nor when she has ivachril theCharnrtrrixtirg of Women, 3 vols. 8vo.t To the above assertion I here add the proof.

It shouldseem as if she came and went away full of the Gram-montMania and for fear of its abatement, had leftthe place (undoubtedly well calculated to produce it)without even visiting another room.

The Billiard library containstwo beautiful SIR Joshua the one of the present Earl Spencer,when four years of age ; the other, of the late Marchioness Camden :both these portraits were admirably engraved for my work. The Marlboroughlibrary contains a most extraordinary portrait of John, Dukeof Marlborough, also engraved for the work in question. I mention afew of the principal pictures in these rooms, of which a glimpse onlymight have rewarded the toil of a little extra locomotion. Mrs. Jamie-sonhas well and warmly noticed the REMBRANDT'S MOTHER, paintedby the son ; but might she not have also just dropt the fact of thesplendid engraving of that matchless portrait to be found in ' the workwhich is briefly mentioned by her as if it had been an eighteen-pennyGuide to a Watering Place ?

This doesnot apply so much to the DIANE DE POICTIERS, because there was onlya very limited number (75 impressions) taken off, and the plate wasafterwards destroyed. I learn that 31. 13s. 6d. has been given for asingle impression of this most original and fascinating portrait.The Anne of Austria and the Ninon de Enclose were offerings atmy hands as gifts. Of the latter, a beautiful engraving, in stirling, onsale, is the property of Mr. Pickering, the bookseller.t It was obtained, as well as two small and very curious heads ofFrancis II. and Marie Stuart, of Mr. Carman, from the Question Crawfordcollection. I think that seventy guineas were given for the Due deGuise ; and not above sixteen for the two small heads which I believeto be thoroughly, if not EXCLUSIVELY, genuine.

It has been my lot to sleep there two nights : in the depthof the winter of 1818, when on a visit to the Duke of Devonshire at'chatsworth. I have made mention of this visit at Hardwicke in theLibrary Companion, p. 596-7, second edit. His Grace drove me overfrom Chatsworth, and left me, at my particular request, to soliloquisetwo days within the spacious and deserted walls of this, his most ancientancestral residence. In my bed-room were the old silver-toppeddogs ; and a huge fire was blazing upon the hearth when I retired to rest(The particulars preceding this retirement may be sought for in thework just mentioned). Opposite the foot of the bed, over the entrancedoor of the room, were some small leaden casements, which caught theflickering light of the expiring flame. The walls of the room werecovered with tapestry of some century and a half standing. The windowwas a large bay one, of the early time of James I. On retiring torest I locked my door ; and, after my first short slumber, I started up,thinking I heard a noise. The fire was yet burning, and through thecasements, just mentioned, I thought I discerned human faces, lookingat me some in anger, some in sorrow, and some in laughter. I fixedmy eyes upon the tapestry. I fancied I heard the huntsman's halloo,the dogs yelling: and the very trees, like those of " Birnam Wood,"seemed to be moving towards me. I leaped from my bed, and sprungto the door : unlocked and opened it. The whole delusion was dissipatedin an instant. There were no human faces ; the trees, and tin-huntsmenand the dogs were fast fixed in their worsted trammels; andon drawing the window curtain aside, to look abroad, I gazed only uponthe leads of the building, bristled with a hoar-frost, upon which t he-coldclear moonbeam seemed to love to be sleeping.I hid Urn rummaging among some old black-letter books, beforeretiring to rest, which may account for this "fantasia." I preserve a566 Author.well as at Althorp, at home. Her work is full ofpoint and vivacity. Perhaps it is too sparkling andabounding in quotation ; but it is the work of a wellcultivated understanding, and of a practised hand.Retournons a nos moutons."In the exact chronological order to be observed,an account of the publication of the BibliographicalCameron should have preceded that of the sedesAlthorpiance : but to keep those works in connectionwhich have an exclusive reference to the name andproperty of my late Patron, I deem it best to speakof the latter in the present place. I took up myground quickly and boldly. The " Cameron"was scarcely sold, and beginning to be very generallycirculated, when I issued proposals for the "jades ;"and at this very moment, too, I meditated my Bi-biographicalTour upon the Continent. The beginning,therefore, of the year 1818, was full ofexcitement and occupation. Within the first threemonths of it, I had satisfactorily ascertained thatmy projected work of the " JEdes" would succeed ;and that I had only to make the necessary arrangementswith Artists under favour of the Nobledrawing (now much injured), made by me, of this identical bedroom ;not forgetting the key of the door, which is silver, and of the prettyworkmanship of the seventeenth century.

It may be well said, that " it deserves to be held in veryhigh estimation for its enchanting delicacy, silver-toned brightness, andextraordinary finish." It came from the Sunderland collection.

Yet it might in some measurebe considered an experimental effort. I was persuadedthat, not only must the work necessarily be ofa totally different complexion from its Decameronicprecursor, but that nothing on the score of art (ofwhat may be called a distracting variety) would befound in it at all comparable with such a precursor.The latter might even with sobriety be designated asoverwhelmingly splendid.

I was, however,particularly fortunate in the selection of twoartists, who did ample justice to the subjects undertakenby them.

Since the very humble employment afforded him at my hands, bycopying a few of the Althorp subjects, Mr. Uwins has visited Italy ;has enlarged his knowledge, and improved his taste; and has enrichedthe walls of our annual exhibition by specimens of art in oil colours,which breathe of the classical air of the country in which they wereconceived and executed.It may not be unacceptable to the reader to be made acquainted withthe subjects at Author which were copied by Mr. Uwins for the publicationin question :Sophonisba Angosciola, Fragment of Cartoon, Raffaelle,Viscount Althorp, A Calm, by Cuyp,John, Duke of Marlborough, A Masked Ball,John, Marquis of Blandford, Georgianaa, first Countess Spencer,Colonel John Russell, Nell Gwynn,Henry VIII., Q.

I was not disappointed in this expectation; but our present business is at Althorp. Inthe summer of 1819 my Noble Patron and hisCountess went abroad ; and in the autumn of thatsame year I took up my position to commence immediateoperations at Althorp.

An avenue of elms,of some two hundred and fifty yards in length,planted by the mother of the late Earl, is the connectinglink, as it were, between the church* andthe private western park gate. Along this route,and from thence to the mansion, was my regulardaily walk, to and fro, in the execution of my labours.Some account of this church, and of its double chancel, of whichone is filled by the MONUMENTS of the SPENCER FAMILY, will be foundin the earlier pages of the Mes ; together with a small plate of two ancientand grotesque ornaments upon the tops of two pews.

"The reader may not be displeased with a part of the note subjoined,in the work here referred to. " This is a scriptural phrase, see 1 Chron.xxii. 16. The earlier versions of this passage come closer to the languageof this inscription : thus, in Coverdale's Bible, of 1535, it is ' Get,get the up and be doing, and the Lorde shall be with the.' In Matthew'sBible, of 1537, it is, ' Up therefore and set upon it, and ye Lordeshal be with the,' In Grafton, 1540, ' Up therefore and be doing,and the Lord shall be with the,' In Barker's, 1607, * Up thereforeaud be doing, and the Lord shall be with the;' and in Barker, 1611,Arise therefore and be doing, and the Lord shall be with thee ;' whichis the present RECEIVED TEXT.

Itcannot be denied that the highly finished copies ofthe original pictures at Althorp, by Messrs.

Mi tan f, . 15710I have been always given to understand, that the extremely ablemanner in which this Engraving was executed led to the choice of Mr.Fiiulen, by Sir Thomas Lawrence, for the execution of the great plateof the late King sitting on a sofa. If this be so, it led at once to profitand to fame. And yet, methinks, a little memento (not savouring ofmoney) might have been transmitted to the Individual, by whose means,not very indirectly, such a result ensued ? Mr. Finden well knows howfond I am of art, and of his talents as an artist.t It was originally intended to have secured Mr. C. WARREN uponthis enchanting little drawing. He was at that time sitting on the tree-topof his art ; and he would doubtless have executed it in a style verysuperior to that in which it now appears ; although, as will be seen, thesame sum was given to Mr. Milan, who certainly does not appear tothe same advantage in this plate as in many of those in the Tour. Itwas a matter of equal anxiety and distress to me to be obliged (from thepressure of time) to take it out of Mr. Warren's hands; but his familyafflictions at once distracted his attention and engrossed his time. Hisson-in-law, Mr. C fennel, was one of the most promising artists of theday, and his death produced a deep sympathy among his graphicbrethren. It strikes me that the two following letters by Mr. Warren,upon the beautiful picture here alluded to, will be read with some interest,as the effusion of a mind sensibly touched with the conflictinganxieties which beset him.Con *t it ttt ion Row, Gray's Inn Road, Jan. l 26, 1819.DEAR SIR,I called on Mr. Arch on Saturday, and saw the exquisitely finishedDrawing you referred me to.

I have now attentively examined the Drawing, which possessesso many difficulties, as well as beauties, that it will require a greatportion of time, and the utmost exertion of the talents I possess to doitjustice.

After the frankoffer you made, I should not have pressed an advance on it ; but froma full conviction that to execute it in the way you will expect from me,it is worth every shilling of the sum. With respect to the mode ofpayment, I wish for no advance till the plate is finished; but contemplatingthe length of time it will occupy, and the trying situation I amplaced in by the afflicting state of my son-in-law, Mr. Clennell, and thedeath of my daughter (having him and his family to support), I shouldbe glad to receive half the amount in Cash, on delivery of a. finishedproof, and the remainder by Note as you propose.

I looked on an old volume as athreefold object of art, curiosity, and intrinsic worth ;and, therefore, I strove immediately to bring it underthe reader's eye, by a faithful tracing of some of itsembellishments, and as faithful a transcript of itstext. In the mode of extract from the latter, thebook itself may be said to be in a manner sub oculis.Tin 1 Catalogue of the Royal Library here, and ofthat in France, is yet more extensive ; but each hasasort of stately aridity, in presenting us with themere titles of books, undiversified by fac-similes, andunaccompanied by disquisitions.

I admit that, in theBIBLIOTHECA SpENCERiANA, very many articles areboth needlessly and injudiciously extended ; and thatfac-similes have been somewhat profusely bestowedupon descriptions of volumes of a secondary importance.But much must be allowed to the fashion andfeeling of the day. On the other hand, in the accountof valuable and scarce works divested of em-helli>hment, there has been, on no one occasion, tothe best of my recollection, any shrinking from ai-lnse and vigorous grappling with the articles described.Cicero, Horace, Terence, and Virgil, aroexamples of this fullness and fidelity of description.Undoubtedly, if opportunity and inclination served,nothing would be more acceptable to the biblio-graphical world if not to the public at la rue than588 Author.an ABRIDGMENT of these seven volumes in one ;divested of all ornament, and containing the descriptionsof such books (and they are many) which havebeen acquired subsequently to the original publication.But it should be of the same size, and in thesame beautifully executed stile of printing.

I had, in turn,erected a Monument to the name of SPENCER . . .quod nee Jovis ira, nee ignes,Nee potent ferrum, nee edax abler vetustas."Whatever of careful research, minute description,and varied detail made public in a form unprecedentedfor its splendour could contribute towardsthe substantial materials of such a Monument, maybefound in THAT . to which I allude. Of course,it is understood that I also include the six othervolumes devoted to the account of the LIBRARY.Civil wrath, rather than "the wrath of Jove " "fire,sword, or time," may and will, in the end, level theproudest structures which have been raised ;but BOOKS will live for aye."This quotation has been before the Public in the Bibliophobia,p. 78. It is a translation " by a Wit of the Age' from the followingOriginals :Author'.The other source of consolation is, that if I havebeen occasionally generous at the expense of pni-rA'y/rr, in the remuneration given to Artists, I havein many instances done good by having cheered asinking heart, and excited a praiseworthy spirit ofemulation.Two years may be said to have elapsed in thepreparation of those materials for the work whichrelated to the Engravings. During that time theBiographical Tour was almost ready to be started.1 had originally intended to have incorporated, inthe first volume of the "^Edes," an account of suchbooks in the Althorp Library as had been in the collectionof DE THOU*, and of such as had been printedMurmur pelisse Homines?

It is, however, a well authenticated fact,that the manuscripts were purchased by COLBERT, and, with the rest ofthat great Minister's manuscripts, were bequeathed to the Royal Library.590 Author.at the presses of the ALDINE FAMILY. My lists ofthese two classes of Books, which were of consider-thequestion is, in regard to the PRINTED BOOKS. Did they go entire tothe President, or did he only become the purchaser of the greater partof them at the sale of the library by public auction ? It is ascertainedthat Du Puy and Queene drew up the catalogue of the library for theexpress purpose of public sale by auction.These doubts have arisen in consequence of casting an eye over thosepieces relating to De Thou's library, which are to be found at the endof the seventh volume of Burley's edition of De Thou's History of hisOwn Times. The principal evidence is that of the learned and irreproachableHurt. He says (ex Commentary de rebus ad eum pertinacious.Aught. 1718, 12mo. p. 390, &c.) : " A few years ago, De Thou,the descendant of the illustrious family of that name which has deservedso well of literature returned from Holland. He was our ambassadorin Holland, where he lived with the greatest splendour, andmaintained the dignity of the French name most gallantly and successfullyagainst the wiles and contumacy of the Spanish ambassador. Helived, however, in so liberal and sumptuous a manner as to injure hisprivate affairs ; which could only be redeemed by the sale of his ancestor'slibrary of that LIBRARY (continues Hurt) which had cost theoriginal possessor full forty years of diligence and expense in the collection; and of which, that it might be preserved entire for the benefitof his family and the literary world, he had strictly forbidden the dispersion,by any means, in his last will and testament. Notwithstandingthe operation of the law had sanctioned this testamentary disposition, itwas nevertheless resolved, from the pressure of domestic necessities, thatthe library should be parted with. I had been somewhat intimate withyoung De Thou for a few years past. He came to me one day, in avery dejected manner, and prefacing something about the difficulties ofthe times, asked me whether I thought I could persuade the king(Louis XIV.) to purchase this library for the use of the Dauphin ?Hurt was the Dauphin's head preceptor] adding, that it was not lesschoice than extensive, and particularly distinguished for the eleganceand splendour of the books. I told him that his wishes should be communicatedto the king and to his minister Colbert.The proposal was unsuccessful. The king answered, that his ownlibrary was already sufficiently large, and that the dauphin might havethe use of that. De Thou, dejected and disappointed, turned round inpursuit of other purchasers : but these he found so callous and parsimonious,that, not agreeing upon a price, the books continued in theirALTIIOK1'.able extent, had undergone the revision of myPatron ; but on second consideration it was thoughtoriginal state, and in the mean time the possessor of them died. Hisheirs reaped so little emolument, that although the bindings, ornaments,and illuminations, &c., had cost little short of 100,000 livres (so DeThou told me himself), the books were absolutely sold for little morethan one-third part of that sum. I bought some of them at the publicsale, and consider them as the greatest ornaments of my library." How,therefore, can we reconcile this statement with the purchase of thelibrary by the PRESIDENT MENARS?Perhaps the noblest specimens in the world of what are called DE'liii or BOOKS, are the Polyglot Bible of Plantin, at Althorp, and theeGrffici of H. Stephen, 1566, folio, at Paris. The latter has beenbriefly, but warmly noticed in the Tour ; the former merits a more expandeddescription than what appears in the James, and is here subjoinedas a specimen of the execution of any of the articles in the Listabove alluded to.This wonderful set is upon LARGE PAPER ; with the exception ofthe three last volumes, which probably were never printed of the samesize, or they would have unquestionably found their way into the libraryof DE THOU. The sacred text is complete in the first five volumes,upon large paper. To say that this is the finest copy of any workwhich belonged to its first illustrious owner, is to say little or nothingwhich can convey an idea of the extraordinary beauty of the types,press-work, and paper. Yet the form is perhaps a little whimsical, itbeing evidently too broad for its length. The praises bestowed uponPlantin, in the fourth page of Montague, 'preface to the reader,' areonly what that incomparable printer merited. De Bure confines hisdescription of this edition to the last three volumes ; but it may be aswell to know, that after the half title of the first volume, three copperplateembellishments (of which the first is the general tide) ensue,and that the title to the cornu cement of the Pentateuch is cut inwood. 'I' In- two prefaces of Montague are followed by three royal< s or admonitions, preceding the Pentateuch title. It is also surprisingthat De Bure mentions no copy of it upon \i Hum, or uponlarge paper. Hrunet notices the vellum copy formerly in the royal libraryranee, now restored ; but says nothing respecting large paper. Isthe present tin only kiu,\m copy of this latter description?

It seemed, however,in the first instance, that I was bound in honour toresuscitate the Dramatis Persona in the Bibliomaniaof which, about this time, a copy wasscarcely to be procured " for love or money." Ifound that I could easily erect my scaffolding ; butof what materials the building was to be constructed,and how its furniture was to be supplied, seemed torequire repeated deliberation.An accident furnished a hint sufficiently strong toset me to work upon. I was walking one eveningwith my friend Mr. Wade*, in the immediate frontof Holland House, and seeing several carriagescoming up the avenue, to set down parties to dinnerwhile the lamp was beginning to shine decidedly inthe large front room on the first floor, which is infact the dining-room my friend jocosely observed,that " those ladies and gentlemen were, withoutdoubt, coming to talk about old pictures and oldbooks, while the lamp had been just trimmed to throwa better light upon the objects before them ;" thatthey had all got their night-caps and morning dressesin their carriages ; and that the Noble Owner of theMansion, with his accustomed urbanity and love ofSee page 330, ante.Decameron.'] PUBLICATIONS CONTINUE > 597hospitality, meant to make it a sort^ visit."

By that time,too, the chief outlines of my plan as it now appearsbefore the public were sufficiently delineated. Ihad been for several years collecting typographicalcuriosities, in the shape of printers' devices, oldwoodcuts, and " id genus omne" and I had alsofilled several memoranda books with notices of thetreasures and illuminations in the British Museumas well as in very many private collections. Thesewere materials in abundance to which I would beof ten secretly wishing to give publicity in some popularshape. The moment, therefore, seemed to be nowarrived when I could bring all my scattered rays tobear upon one point, and to break upon the publicat tendon with a singularity as well as splendour of embellishmentto which it had been hitherto a stranger.The Spencer Library was sailing with a steady andprosperous breeze before the wind, when I first madepublic my intentions of giving existence to the BI-biographicalDECAMERON, by &slightavantpropos,in which the work was announced as likely to bein two volumes*.

The Public are aware that it was theintention of the Author to have confined his Work within two Volumes ;but, as is frequently and indeed generally the case, a quantity of matterhas been collected, the extent of which was not foreseen, and the natureof which is presumed to be too interesting to abridge or suppress. TheOrnaments have increased in the same proportion. It has thereforebecome absolutely necessary to encroach upon a third Volume, which,with copious Indexes, will certainly conclude the Work. This arrangement,however, is made with no view of increasing the original Price,which continues the same ; namely, 7 1. 17 s. 6d. for the small paper, and15/. 15s. for the large. The only method left for the Author to meet theserious increase of expense, unavoidably attendant upon such enlargementof plan, has been to fix upon every remaining copy, on the day ofpublication, an additional Guinea and a Half ; that is to say, 9/. 9s. forthe three volumes complete. In the mean time the price will continueas before. The Publication will unquestionably appear in the course ofthe ensuing Spring.

Another object pressed uponmy consideration after the work had gone to press.I was desirous of a LIVING PORTRAIT or two (as Ihave been, equally in vain, in the present work togive an additional interest, as well as embellishment,to my pages; and those of Mr. Roscoe and Mr.George Hibbert were thought likely to be productiveof the object in view.

He was the largest shareholder(as may be seen at page 600) in the Cameron Sank, and it wasonly due to his prompt and generous support that he should have someidea of the Work to which he had so liberally lent his aid.

It happens that good fortune now and thenputs some good books into my possession; and when inyour work (which will be consulted hereafter by all whoadopt this pursuit) I find it recorded that I possess any suchrare treasure, I consider the record as valuable to me, becauseit ensures, in a great degree, to me, or my successor,the public estimation of the article.

Ihoped, however, to possess the physiognomy of the veteran Orontes(see p. 294, ante), or James Bindley, Esq. ; the more so, as his firstrefusal was somewhat coy or coquettish. He observed to me " that hecould not bring his mind to say positively yes, or no ; and must thinkthe matter over more than twice before he ventured to appear in public;"adding, " that he never had his portrait painted, and now felt less inclinationthan ever upon that subject" Finding it a doubtful point, Iceased to press it : although that venerable gentleman did afterwards sitfor his portrait to Mr. Beings ; and a private plate is struck off from it.If I mistake not, there is also a print of Mr. Bindley 's portrait takenwhen he was about forty-five ; with his hair tied behind in a club, andwith formal side curls.t The passage in question is as follows : . . . .

There are in addition two octavo volumes of Supplement, and onenot yet quite completed, in folio.The ten volumes contain about FIFTEEN HUNDRED additions or Illustrations,which may be thus classed : 450 proofs, for the most partonIndia paper, and before the letter, of the ordinary decorations andplates of the book ; some with variations, and some originally intendedfor the book, but not published. This in itself would amount to anillustration of the best class. Above 400 portraits, some proofs, andseveral private plates ; 200 drawings and tracings from manuscripts andold books several coloured in imitation of the originals ; and nearly 500other pieces, original devices of printers, views, alphabets, wood cuts,and miscellanies of every description.u The first volume of the Supplement is of a miscellaneous character ;the principal features of which are letters from Walter Scott, Mr. Jones,Mr. Hebe, and other distinguished Collectors, &c., pending the sale ofthe Roxburgh Library, literary trifles connected with the Bibliomaniacs,and the accounts for printing, paper, engraving, &c., for the Biblio-graphical Cameron. The second volume of the Supplement is formedwholly of copies of decorations, 100 in number, from books more or lessrare, executed with singular spirit and fidelity, by a near and dear relationof the owner of the book, with a masterly and appropriate frontispiecefrom the pencil of Mr. J. P. Nealee. ' The boards ' for the binding, arethe original copperplates of the Diana of Poictiers and Lady Jane Gray.The third, or folio volume of the Supplement (not quite complete), containsa few portraits too large for the book, and title pages, chiefly fromthe Plantin press, many of them proofs before the letter. The contentsof the Supplements are exclusive of the 1530 additions to the Ten Daysor volumes of the book.The insertion of portraits in a book is the easiest of all modes ofillustration, if there be a sufficiency of means wherewith to procure them.In the absence of these means, the possessor of these volumes has notmade engraved portraits his particular object ; his aim has been to collectmaterials rather out of the ordinary track of illustration, yet appropriateto the subjects treated upon in the book. Amongst the drawingsare some few very pretty specimens byUwins, J. P. Nealee, G. Lewis,and the Author.

[The Tour.before the public, in three splendid octavo volumes,aided and adorned by all the luxury of paper, printing,and ART. I place a stress on the latter word,as I am well justified in doing ; for the united expensesof DRAWING and ENGRAVING amounted tofour thousand seven hundred and forty pounds ; addabout three thousand for paper, printing, copperplateprinting and boarding and you have the extentof the risk. But I was resolved to spare nopains, and to shrink from no liberal remuneration ofacknowledged merit. For upwards of two years, conjointlywith the JEdes Althorpiance, was the Tourprogressing at the press and with various artists.Of these artists, Mr. GEORGE LEWIS must necessarilybe placed at the head ; not only because heattended me professionally through the whole tour,but because his pencil, with some very few exceptions,furnished the entire materials for the burin.Mr. Lewis, at starting, was less known to me thanhis brothers : but as he was recommended to me bya very old friend and competent judge, Mr. Masquerier*; and as his manners were simple andobliging, and his diligence, activity, and versatility,beyond all question, I consented, scarcely withouta moment's hesitation, to engage him.

He travelled like agentleman, and he fared like one. For a youngman, imperfectly known in his profession, the opportunitywas, in every sense of the word, a GOLDENone. It proved abundantly to be so. Mr. Lewismight have equally enlarged his knowledge and improvedhis taste by what he did, and been paid liberallyby his employer ; but there the matter mighthave ended. Not so his engagement with me. Hehad the extraordinary good luck to have his talentsmade known in the most favourable manner imaginable.The very first artists, as Engravers, wereengaged upon his drawings. These drawings werecarefully executed in sepia from his first pencilsketches taken on the spot ; and as there was onlyone colour to manage, the facility of execution wasmaterially promoted. There can be no doubt butthat the drawings were as full of ability as theyevinced versatility of talent : but when one remembersthat such men as Mitan, Landseer, LeKeux, Finden, Smith, Robinson, Romney, th, and Worthington, &c., were engaged at liberalprices, to engrave them, surely the designer hadabundant reason to congratulate himself upon thefelicity of his lot. In fact, such a sort of stemscarried him at once to the top of the tnv.I must do Mr. Lewis the justice to add, that hethrew his whole soul into the undertaking ; and wasarmy and late, as well in preparing his own designs656 PUBLICATIONS CONTINUED.

Frommy back parlour window, " many a time and oft,"have I seen him, with accelerated step, making towardsme, brandishing a rolled proof in his hand,his countenance beaming with delight if it happenedto be to his heart's content. But what a continuedsketch of mental anxiety on my part ! What tempersto soften down what irregularities to controlwhat delays to endure what SUMS TO PAY ! ! In acentury hence, the following list of payments to theseveral engravers and artists engaged in this Tour,may possibly be considered a curiosity : and if thereader have expressed his surprise at the paymentsfor the Althorpian decorations*, he may be stillmore astonished at what he is here about to peruse.Perhaps I was the first individual to give one hundredguineas for a plate to be inserted in a royaloctavo volume ; but such w T as the price paid for theSouth View of Rouen Cathedral, engraved by Mr.Henry Le Keux, and for the Halt of Pilgrims, byMr. Mitan t.

Itis the assemblage of such numerous figures which gives an air of indescribablebrilliancy to the print in question. The TWO Le Keuxs aregiants in their way. The burin of John, the elder, is perhaps bolder andbroader, and for effects on a larger scale : but let any man view the interiorof Milan Cathedral by Henry, and how absurd to institute comparisons,when each talent of its KIND is equal !

It will be seen to what an extent he wasremunerated for his contributions to my work. He was an admirableartist, ready at anything, and clever at every thing : but the " Halt nfthe Pilgrims" vol. iii. p. 421, is not calculated, from the heaviness andsameness of the draperies of the numerous figures, to do exact justice tohis merits. I consider the Stuttgart Market-place (for which he hadeighty guineas) to be the chef-d'ceuvre of his talents, in the Tour ; andeven beyond the very expensive plate of the " Masked Sail" (see p. 583ante), in the ^Edes Althorpiana?. The street scenery at Vire, and thegroups at St. Lo and in Strasbourg Cathedral, (vol. i. p. 394 ; vol. iii.p. 32), are singularly clever and effective.It will be seen that the elder Mr. Lewis (Frederick Charles) wasalso pretty amply remunerated as an engraver for his labours on myTour.

And so I would speak of his Lady Wriothesley Russell,from the elegant pencil of the elder Charon. It is perfection. Andso of the " Seville Nun" from the beautiful drawing of his son John.The black gown, and the picturesquely disordered head-dress, have allthe freedom and the mellowness of the pencil. In sketchy subjects ofthe human figure, there is nothing to equal him. Mr. Lewis is nowengaged upon bringing out twenty plates from the drawings of ClaudeLorraine in the British Museum, bequeathed to that establishment by thelate Richard Payne Knight. They will be executed in the manner ofEarlom's engravings of the Liber Veritatis, and cannot fail, I shouldthink, of securing a very large sale. Still, as was observed by me twentyyears ago, I greatly desire talents like his to be applied to one TRULYNATIONAL object, the engraving of the HOLBEIN PORTRAITS in theRoyal Collection. Compared with what I have seen of ONE engravingby him from these portraits, that of Pestalozzi is a FICTION.I have spoken of Mr. Lewis's son : I might have said Sons. If thereflex of his own talents as an artist can make a father happy, Mr.Lewis has just cause to be both happy and proud of his progeny. JohnFrederick is galloping as fast as a young man can possibly gallop towardsperfection in his Art : and yet, let me whisper in his ear, " Festinalente." He has brought home all Spain in his portfolio her nuns,monks, friars, monasteries, palaces, and fastnesses. His Alhambra isa masterly production ; spirited, sketchy, and full of interest and instruction.But Murphy's Antiquities of the Arabs in Spain must andwill never be forgotten. See Bibliog. Cameron, vol. ii. p. 391. Mr.Lewis's " Preaching Friar" may even presume to elbow the JohnKnox of Wilkie. He has a brother of the name of Charles, who is takingup a position as an Acquaint Engraver, which promises to place him onthe topmost branch of the tree in that department of art.Then again we have one Charles Lewis the uncle, and thereforebrother of Frederick Charles and George who may be fairly said, Ithink, to have some notion of BOOK BINDING !

[Tie Tour.There were 100 copies upon large paper and 900upon small. Owing to many of the prints being toolarge for a sufficient margin in the small paper, thecopies upon large paper are doubtless, on this accountalone, to be much preferred ; but in addition,these latter contain all the earlier impressions of theplates. And yet, in many instances, so sound andartist-like was the workmanship of the engraver,that, with one plate the portrait of Pisan, in volumetwo 1 presented a seven hundred and fiftieth,and a seventy-fifth impression, and the former waspreferred. In fact, all the characteristic smallerplates which may be called the marrow of thework being executed in the line manner, and uponIndia paper, there is very little perceptible differencebetween the impressions of the two papers. Afest of the earlier copies will be found in thefigure of Christ, and of the Soldiers sleeping, (inthe second volume, between pages 146 and 147),being of a somewhat darker hue in the brown inkin which they are printed. On the day of publication,the fight and struggle was to obtain copies withthe earlier impressions. Messrs. Leighton were myboarders. Their premises were besieged by hackneycoaches. But every one could not have theirs biteof the apple ; and even those who came in for thefifth or sixth bite, were at last reconciled to theirfate. The apple appeared to be yet juicy and wellflavoured, and was soon " bought up" in the market.I have spoken of the " first step" taken as beingThe Tour.] PUBLICATIONS CONTINUED.

Had an additional guinea been putupon each copy (and a very knowing bookseller toldme that the three volumes were cheap at \ C 2L 12&),I might have probably realised about 900/. As itwas, I think I lost 120/. as a dead book-debt withallmy travelling expenses (about 300/.) unredeemed.Even the sale of Mr. Lewis's beautiful drawings leftme miserably deficient. But then there was glory,and honour, and even patriotism, to reward me ! Ihad travelled far and wide in search of books andof book-establishments ; I had lost no opportunityof making known the treasures of my own country,whenever a fit occasion presented itself. I soughtpeace and good-will among men, and I found it.On a limited but honourable scale, I may be said tohave been a benefactor ; for in various towns I purchasedlargely, and upon liberal terms. Before Iturned my back upon the Continent, I incline tothink that little short of 900/. had been expended inParis, Augsburg, Munich, and Vienna, for books,chiefly for the library of my Noble Patron : andthis, without mention of the bold stroke of biblio-graphical diplomacy at the court of Stuttgart, whu-hsecured for him the two Virgilss, of which he hadfor twenty years anxiously desired the possession*.This "bold stroke of bibliographical diplomacy" has been twicetold in both editions of the Tour. In the second edition (vol. iii. p. 56)it will be seen that, together with a fac-simile of his autograph, a doubt<d about the then existence of M. LeBret, the librarian of thepublic library, with whom the diplomacy was conducted. I since learnthat he is dead. His memory will be as much cherished by me as was664 PUBLICATIONS CONTINUED. [The Tour.Nothing gave greater energy to my exertions thanthe warmth of his approbation and the liberality ofhis requital. When at Munich, on sitting down inan apartment, of which the floor was covered withmy purchases for Spencer House while the Latin and German Bibles, and the AldineGreek Force of 1498, were within an arm's lengthof me I scarcely knew how to moderate my expressionsof joy in transmitting the intelligence toHis Lordship. Nor was Lord Spencer's reply lessjoyous and commendatory. In a letter from Ride,dated August 30, 1818, he thus observed: "Youhave indeed a right to say that your letter containsGREAT AND GLORIOUS NEWS ;' and to borrow anyboastings from the broadsides of Erhard llatdolt * ;his person and many excel! em good qualities. It was said that I hadoutflanked him in the negotiation, and that he had yielded too soon.All that need be observed in reply is, that the King of Wittenberg, hismaster, was entirely satisfied with the result. This " bold stroke " wasachieved at Manheim, on quitting Germany to return through France.Lord Spencer was thus pleased to express himself, in a letter dated 18thOct. 1818, from Althorp, on receiving the news of the acquisition of theVirgilss. " Though I apprehend that it is probable that this letter willnot be in time to reach you before you leave Paris, I cannot resist riskingit to say with how much pleasure I received (on the 16th) yoursfrom Manheim, dated the 7th, which proved, indeed, a glorious conclusionto your bibliographical expedition in Germany. I cannot sufficientlypraise the prompt decision of your measures, by which yousecured the possession of the two Virgilss, and I am quite satisfied withthe bargain, which, all things considered, is as good an one as couldbe expected."I had purchased a broadside (the only one I have ever seen) printedby Erhard Ratdolt, a beautiful printer of great celebrity, at Venice inthe fifteenth century of the Curators of the public library at Augsburg.I think the price was about three or four pounds.The Tour.~\ PUBLICATIONS CONTINUED.or of any other more fortunate Bibliomaniac. Intruth, you have really done wonders ." In thissame letter His Lordship was pleased to remark,that " Mr. Grenville, who was present that morningon the receipt of my Munich letter, was nearly asmuch pleased with its contents as he was himself."And I have it in the handwriting of that eminentindividual and profound bibliographer himself, thathe had seen, with equal delight and surprise, theextraordinary acquisitions which I had made forLord Spencer, and which exceeded all that couldhave been hoped for."

I had paid Fend 10/. 10*. for this fac-simile, which had beenconfided by Bartsch to one of the Ambassador's (Marquis of Londonderry's)Couriers.

After the first ordinary salutations, ourfamiliarity increased ; when, pacing the magnificentmarble floor of that matchless book-room, and lockinghis arm within mine, he observed, " Je n'aimepas vos compatriotes.

Of these, his Pointe GBAVEUB,in 22 vols. 8vo., is justly the most celebrated. Some of Bartsch's ownetchings might, in three instances out of five, be mistaken for the Originalsof which they are copies. In the whole, his name is subjoinedto five hundred and five engravings. A fac-simile of his autographappears in vol. iii. 394 of the second edition of this Tour. Bartsch was acautious man in discourse, with a warm heart, and a vivid fancy. Thegovernment of his country had somewhat austrianised his principles,which, left to the freedom of their own operation, were liberal andurge. He told me that a Review like the Edinburgh would not betolerated ; and even the Quarterly was a little too saucy for some of theVienna stomachs. And yet every body loved the Emperor and calledhim a " BON PAPA."

When I drove up to theGrand Hotel at Nancy, there seemed to be a demurto admit me. I was anxious to know the cause ;and alighting, begged forthwith to see the Masterof the Inn. He approached hesitatingly, and evidentlynot much disposed for the interview. Mysalutation was one of studied civility. He returnedit yet more formally. " Cannot I have admissionhere, Sir, to-night ? My train is small." " Sir,have you any acquaintance with the ladies and gentlemenwho have just left us?" On asking theirnames, and finding that I was wholly ignorant ofthem, I replied, "none at all."

He then told me that they had called forChampagne, and not satisfied with it in bottles, hadboiled it in a kettle, and thrown a large tumbler ofit, hissing hot, into the face of his head waiter. Amost sympathetic " Mon Dieu!" on my part helpedto soothe his irritability and a solemn assurancethat I could not afford to drink Champagne, hot orcold. " But, sir, you do not wage war againstBurgundy ?" To win myself into his good graces,and to make him forget my predecessors, I ordered abottle of Vin de Beaune, and his best/ricandeauof any kind. I begged he would come and sit withme after dinner ; help to dispatch my Burgundy,and to draw up " our judgment." "When thesecond bottle, sir, has had its proper influence," saidhe archly interrupting me. He came, and beforethe appearance of the judgment working secondbottle, he was perfectly appeased.

Vainbewitchery! Add to all this book-fever of thebrain, I encountered much locomotion, which, withshort stoppages, and hurried glances of objects, tendprodigiously to diminish the weight of human flesh.When I returned to Paris, I was scarcely recognisedby some old Kensington friends. But to return tothe immediate consequences, or in other words, togive an account of the publication of a WORK, uponwhich so much time, so much anxiety, and so muchmoney had been expended. Cooled by the result ofthe Cameron, I did not, even for a moment, anticipateany elaborate review of it in our more po-popularCritical Journals ; but in the mean time mysubscribers and kind Mends were as prompt andenergetic as ever in their congratulations on thesplendour of the graphical embellishments, whichseemed even to eclipse their predecessors. A veryodd but I am sure a very honest feeling possessedme at starting. I was resolved to make presents offour copies (with the earliest impressions) to thefollowing distinguished public characters with thetwo first only of whom I had any personal knowledge: namely, to my Diocesan, the then Bishop ofLondon, and now Archbishop of Canterbury ; toThe Tour.'} PUBLICATIONS Continued i7 >Sir Walter Scott, to Robert Southey, Esq. (the PoetLaureat), and to Thomas Campbell, Esq., thePoet. I considered the three latter not only tobe at the head of their several departments, ingenius and literature, but as veterans entitledto an act of homage and respect from a "rankami file" man in the regiment of the belles-lettres.With the Bishop, I felt great delicacy in theapproach. A splendid present from an beneficedclergyman to his Diocesan, carried with it a sortof prima facie doubt or suspicion about the disinterestednessof the gift, and in consequence tojustify its refusal. What the exact words of theletter, accompanying the donation, were, I cannottell, for the whole was a sort of off-hand production.But this I can tell that my feelings and views wereutterly unconnected with professional objects. Ihad long considered Dr. Rowley, not only as myDiocesan, but as a Gentleman, a Scholar, and aDivine. The language of his acceptance of myhumble offering, while it confirmed my appreciationof his character, was most gratifying to my feelings,and will I am persuaded be most acceptable tomy readers.Fulham, May 21, 1821.DEAR SIR,"The sentiments expressed with so much delicacy in theIrttcr which accompanied your very splendid ;ind beautifulwork, have relieved me from the embarrassment which 1should actually have felt at a mark of attention which isusually confined to publications of less expense, and to\ \674 PUBLICATIONS CONTINUED.

LONDON."So much in consequence of the first donation.The result of the second is worth the reader's especialattention. It is this identical answer, which, inreference to the writer, I have called in a precedingpage*, " perhaps one of the most curious onrecord." I had long been fully convinced that SirWalter Scott was the " Author of Waverley" evenbefore I had read the very ingenious and convincingpamphlet upon the subject by the younger Mr.Adolphus. " Aut Scotus aut" .was ever mysecret conviction. Thus impressed, I sent thatillustrious Individual a copy of my Tour ; with therequest or condition that he would be pleased toconvey it to the Author of Waverley, as a humbleproof of my admiration of those talents which, inthe estimation of others as well as of myself, had solargely contributed to the delight and instruction ofthe British public. My letter was somewhat afterthe fashion of that in the case of the Bishopof London, but I took no copy of what I wrote.The drencher, however, was as follows. I apologisedSee p. 398.The Tour'] PUBLICATIONS CONTINUED. 675to Sir Walter for imposing this trouble upon him ;but " after repeated inquiries, I found that the onlyprobable chance of my Present reaching the Authorof Waverley, was through his own kind intervention."His reply at once dissipated the fiction, andconvinced me that " the Author" in question, andSir Walter Scott, were ONE AND THE SAME PER-Songe."Edinburgh, June 13, 1821.MY DEAR SIR,Upon my return from a little excursion to the country,I found your splendid work, which I think one of the mosthandsome that ever came from the British Press and returnyou my best thanks for placing it in my possession as amark of your regard.

It was my good fortune, between the publicationsof the Cameron and the Tour, to makethe acquaintance of a Mr. Dobree, sen., a septuagenarianat the time of my acquaintance with him.He was a native of Jersey, and a retired Britishmerchant his son having a counting-house in thevicinity of that all-important street "hight" Threadneedle.Although our acquaintance had been ofvery short growth, it quickly ripened into whatmight have been called intimacy. In Mr. Dobree,sen., I found my old friend Mr. Tyson* revived.See page 197, ante.The Tour.] Publications CONTINUED. 687He lived at Walthamstow ; one of the very prettiestand most picturesque (if the neighbourhood of Poorestbe taken into consideration) villages invicinity of London. I have spent more thanone or two most sympathising days with him there ;for his cellar was curious, and his table was large.He loved art in all its varieties ; and had been asort of Maecenas, in former days, to Chantrey, toTurner, and to Wilkie *: having some fine sea-piecesof the second (when his style was grand fromthe breadth of his shadows and the sobriety of hiscolouring), and of the latter, the original picture ofHiring the Servant." In fact, the print from thislatter picture was dedicated to its owner. Mr.Dobree had, of all men whom I knew, one of themost pleasant and unaffected modes of address, andreception of his friends. His heartiness of speechdid not enumerate into noisy exclamation or generalisingremark. It was quiet, warm, and winning.A few words, in his sotto voce manner of utteringthem, found their way directly to your heart. Hishand was always fully grasped within yours . not asort of cold, stiff, protruding, pick-locking forefingerbut the whole four fingers and thumb wentinstantly within all the wards of friendship's lock.My intimacy with him was of too short a duration :Mr. Wilkie was engaged by Mr. Dobree to design his first historicalpicture being the death of Sir IMnlij Suliu-y, in small and engravedley llaimbach, for Mr. Dobree's very curious book, entitled the BOOK OPDEATH.688 PUBLICATIONS CONTINUED.

I believe Mr. Dobreewas buried in Walthamstow churchyard, not far fromthe grave of one, over whom he had been instrumentalin procuring the chisel of Chantrey toraise a splendid monument. It will be seen fromthe ensuing letter by my departed friend, that hewas disposed to " revel" in more than one copy ofthe work under consideration.

Of this publication,Mr. Abraham John Valpy (of whose spirit of enterprise,as well as love of honest literature, I have saidno more in the Cameron* than is justly his due)was at once the Patron, the Printer, and Publisher.The first Editor was a Mr. Peter Bailey, a gentlemanwholly unknown to me ; but apparently a man ofan elegantly constructed mind, and by no meansdeficient in the ordinary topics of taste and criticism.He was gentlemanly in his manners, andmild in his discourse. Mr. Valpy, Mr. Bailey, andmyself met at my house to concoct the IntroductoryAddress ; always the most awkward, generalising,and little meaning, piece of composition in the wholework, and usually as safe . as a speech from thethrone. I composed an address myself, which wasapproved in part : two others were composed butneither of the three was adopted.

Of thesecontributions, the most remarkable in its effect wasthat entitled " A Day at Dulwich College' 9 Perhapsthe personal history of Literature contains noinstance of stouter courage than that of a Writercoming forward, in the most solemn manner whichthe law could impose upon him, to avow himself tobe the Author of a production, supposed and believedto have been written by another 9 for the expresspurpose of wounding the feelings of a third person.This is all I choose to say upon the subject at thispresent moment.

The scene describedtook place on the 4th of June, 1822, when Dr.Butler was head master."A DAY AT HARROWAND A SPEECH-DAY too ! On Thursday, June 4, I ascended, aslead Ixjen 'the custom of my forefathers,' the hill of Harrow, in orderto witness the gay sights, and to hear the grand speeches, which areusually made at that distinguished seminary about a fortnight or a monthbefore the Midsummer recess. It is all mirth, joyance, and jollity, onthese occasions. Every tongue breaks out into rapturous exclamations ;every eye sparkles with delight, and every bosom beats with expectation.It is difficult to say which of the two classes, the lads or their parents,feel the greater gratification; and may I not add a third class theMasters? * * * * *No well-educated human being, I verily believe, whether or not hehave a son there, can visit Harrow on these occasions without feelinghis spirits dancing within him. The road, the country, the ascent, theview, the RECEPTION always render such a journey among the pleasantnessof my existence. And if the day be fair and fine, it is hardlypossible for any thing to exceed the rich and unbounded champagnewhich lies out-stretched before you. So much for protege. I ascended,as 1 said and according to the custom of my forefathers the hill ofHarrow, on the 4th of this month ; but not on foot. It was agreed thatmy old friend BERNARDO should put his well-known pair of black, fleetcoursers, to a neat tea-coloured carriage, which might be very easily mistakenfor a physician's, and that, with a postilion, in a sort of Epsomlivery, (being a white silk jacket, with chocolate-coloured stripes), weshould move forward, &c. &c.We rattled onward at more than a swing canter, passed every thingand every body, to the admiration of the lads, who were now, like bees,all swarming over the place and pulled up, as a postilion so attiredought to pull up that is to say, at something like the peril of tearingthe horses' tongues out of their mouths. We made our salutations toour excellent old friend and right-hospitable host, MENALOAS, as well asto his fairest of all fair sposas f BELINDA, and then lost no time in endeavouringto secure good seats at the forthcoming exhibition.

The communication was sentby me to the Museum, the day after the speech, inthe following words :On Friday, the 10th of this month May, 1822], Mr. Canning issupposed to have made his farewell speech in the House of Commons,on the second reading of his own bill for the restoration of the rightsof seven Roman Catholic Lay Peers to sit in the House of Lords. Thefirst reading of this important bill was carried by a majority of five, in aHouse so crowded, as to want only one towards the number of 500members. The second reading was carried by a majority of twelve, inaHouse wanting about forty of the same number. This shows what alively interest the country took in the discussion. But, if we mistakenot, an interest almost as lively was taken, by the House of Commonsin particular, to witness the last display of senatorial eloquence by theRt. Hon. Mover of the bill. It was evident, both from the complexionof the debate, and the general feeling of the House, that this ' lastspeech* was anticipated with that sort of vehement desire, and personalfondness, which we take in the farewell of any favourite public characterwho has charmed us by his talents, and won us over to him by his attainments.The triumph of Mr. Canning on his taking a temporaryleave of his country, for the highest of all situations in the Asiaticworld was indeed complete ; for he received alike the applause of theTreasury Bench, and the cheers of the Opposition. Now, we contendthat nothing but absolute and unequalled talent, in the way in which itwas exhibited, could have called forth this general and simultaneousdemonstration of respect. We have nothing here to do with politics.In the devious and intricate mazes of a political life, especially in thehigher departments of it, we know perfectly well how difficult it is tojudge from a partial knowledge, and from imperfect glimpses ; and thatgeneral and damnatory conclusions are drawn where the premises havebeen limited, and where a consequent restraint has been imposed whenacting within such limits. We believe, however, that we are speakingthe words of truth and soberness when we observe, that there is not asingle member of his majesty's privy council, nor one of the most activeand able leaders of the opposition, who is not ready to express bothsurprise and regret at the withdrawing of so radiant a star from thepolitical hemisphere.The political life of Mr. C. is about to receive rather a prematuresuspension, than decease. He leaves us, with the regrets and wishes ofevery benevolent heart that his return may be speedy and safe; and inhis absence, we shall dwell upon the recollection of his talents, as we doMuseum'] PUBLICATIONS CONTINUED. 711on the pencilled resemblance of a dear and separated friend. Our presentbusiness, however, is to say a few words on the character of Mr.Ces ELOQUENCE; of that eloquence, which includes reasoning, wit,imagery, declamation, and persuasion. It will be better, perhaps, tomix all these points together in our remarks ; for nothing is more tediousand uninteresting than a lecture on each of these distinctive peculiaritiesof eloquence.Longinus seems to concentrate the whole excellence of oratory inaction.If this be so, Mr. C. will not be very remote from perfection.The charm of action may be said to depend a good deal upon the charmof person ; and especially on physiognomical expression. With a figurea little above the mean or middle stature, the countenance of our oratoris most expressive. A broad open front, elevated forehead, large blueeyes now beaming with gaiety, and now flashing with indignationwith an action, always animated, and not unfrequently graceful, aidedby a full and melodious voice these have always obtained for Mr. C.that attention, which, even unconnected with other causes, an orator ispretty sure to obtain. Yet there is a mannerism in his voice and action.In truth, all first-rate geniuses are mannerists. Mr. Pitt was a mannerist,and so was Mr. Fox. There is, indeed, a mannerism in all thespeeches of the House of Commons ; a mannerism, decidedly capableof improvement. Hence we observe that swing of the arm and sway ofthe body, that frequent jerking at the close of a period, and that violenceof action, where the matter is not proportionably weighty and convincing.If, however, Mr. Canning be not free from some of these objections, hepossesses many qualifications which more than counterbalance them.Whenever he rises on a subject of which he is full, and in which heconfidently anticipates the cheering of the House, nothing can be moredelightful and gratifying than his strain of eloquence. His thoughtsseem to breathe, and his words to burn ; and the country, as well as theHouse, seems to hang upon the music of his periods, and the energy ofhis appeals. Sometimes, at the end of a long and didactic speech andin which there was necessarily much official detail we have seen himbreak forth in a strain of brilliancy, like stars from an expiring rocket,which made you forget all its preceding dryness. In argument, Mr. Canningis not so close, vehement, and irresistible, as was Fox. We cannotsay of him as Plutarch said of Pericles fipovrav fie ainbv Roi atnpair-7. ii' ore cijfir)^opolij t Seivbv 6e Kcpavvbv cV <y\u>fforj 0t'^>i/ Xe<yoVro>>and as, indeed, we may say of Fox. But then Mr. Canning is notwanting both in clearness of conception and acuteness of reasoning ; andin all the constitutional speeches which he has made, at Liverpool andin London, (in which, doubtless to his own disbelief, there is nearly asniiu-li of ul t i : />jittm as of toryUm), one cannot but discover the traits of712 PUBLICATIONS CONTINUED. [Museum.a mind singularly adapted to comprehend all the philosophical views, aswell as the minuter machinery, of the British Constitution. Cradled inwhiggish, it was natural that our Orator should at times betray theproofs of a mitigated Tory.In wit, he is now without a rival. Perhaps he is not so brilliant aswas Sh erica ; and, if irony be considered a constituent part of wit, notso caustic and cutting as Pitt. He has a great portion of humour, andis singularly playful and splendid. At times, however, his wit has greatforce ; and, as a proof of it, is generally dreaded by his opponents. Whois now to make a finishing speech commenting on the conflicting argumentsin the debate, and interweaving with his comments a hundredlittle brilliant flowers of classical gaiety it were perhaps vain to inquire.Who is now after a hot and tempestuous night of angry discussion tocheer and refresh the wearied combatants by a display of beautiful fancy,enlivened by apt quotation? Have we not, on many such eveningsfound the remarks of Quintilian on Cicero abundantly verified in ourCanning ? ' Non enim pluvias (ut ait Pandarus) aquas collegii, sed vivogurgle exundat, dono quondam providence genius, in quo total viresseas eloquent experiretur. Nam quis ducere diligenter, movere vehementlyprotest? Cui tanta unquam jucunditas adfuit*?' The Atticsalt and pleasantry of Mr. C. will not indeed be easily supplied fromother quarters.In imagery, our Orator is inferior to Burke, and in declamation toPitt : but he combines more of these two properties than either of hisgreat predecessors. His love of classical lore mixes itself with almostevery thing which he describes : but this weakens in some measure theeffect of his own natural powers. His periods are sometimes mouldedin Ciceronian structure ; and yet this is not always accomplished withoutinversion and obscurity. There is less verbosity about his speeches thanin those of Mr. Pitt; from some of whose most elaborate orations yourose rather with astonishment than conviction that great man beingfrequently, like Julius Africans, f in cura variorum nimis, et com-position non nunquam longer.' In point of polish, or finish, perhapsthe preference is to be given to Mr. Canning ; in whose exuberance,even, there is generally something classical and impressive.The art and end of eloquence, let Longinus and Quintilian declaimas they please, is persuasion. Now persuasion depends a good dealupon personal authority, or relative situation. A minister is sure to bemore persuasive than an independent member. Both shall be equallysincere. But if we could put relative situation out of the question, weDe Inst. Oral. lib. x.Museums"] PUBLICATIONS CONTINUED. 713can conceive nothing more persuasive (even without the recent evidenceof it furnished by Sir T. Lethbridge*) than the eloquence of Mr. Canning; and supposing him to have held the high and responsible situationof Pitt, the world would have beheld in him perhaps the most perfectorator of the British Senate."Mr. Canning did afterwards hold " the high andresponsible situation" of his early friend and patron,Mr. Pitt ; and just as his commanding talents andmagnificent views were about to be triumphantly developed,it pleased a mysterious but all-wise Providenceto take him from us. Like the leader whomhe succeeded in the House of Commons, HE, too,sunk prematurely . . . but from a cause of a wholly oppositenature. It seemed to me, on my last view ofhim in the House, as if the weight of the world weresitting on his brow : so deeply anxious the mindso palpably yielding the body ! I did not hear hismarvellous speech in justification of sending troopsto Portugal then, in fact, upon their march butmore than one or two friends who did hear it, andwho were old stagers in the House, and Whigs intothe bargain, assured me that it was something almostunearthly. But a truce . for the present.Upon the death of Mr. Bailey t I was offered theEditorship of the Journal at a salary of 200/., with aSir Thomas Lethbridge avowed that Mr. Canning's eloquence orargument had induced him to change his mind in favour of RomanCatholic emancipation.t His death was sudden, and free from pain.

It seemed,therefore, that I had only to apply the key in mypossession to the door of that Cabinet, in which, forso long a time, a great mass of bibliographical materialshad been gradually accumulating.Under this impression, I sketched the outline ofmy LIBRARY COMPANION, and submitted it to myPublishers, of whom Mr. Joseph Harding, not longthen established as the successor of Messrs.

His proposals for thepurchase of the copyright, along with Mr. Major,each to have a half-share, were so liberal that Ihesitated not one moment to accept them; and Iwent to work with as much zeal and alacrity as hadever possessed me.

See the JEdes, vol. i. 207 225.t To Mr. Petrie, the friend of my early youth, I also owed manyobligations for corrections and additions in my " English De Sure"and the "first day" of the Bibliographical Cameron. His knowledgeof ancient MSS. places him second to none ; while in those whichappertain to " BRITISH HISTORY," I consider him the facile princeps ofliving antiquaries. How well and wisely are hands like his employed,by the government of his country, in erecting and consolidating thefabric of our Ancient History !

To the latter I had, and ever shall have,a weight of obligation to acknowledge, which is notlikely to be effectually discharged without attainingto the age of twice " threescore years and ten."Other aids abroad, were the libraries of EarlSpencer, Right Hon. T. Grenville, Mr. Hebe, Mr.Hibbert, &c. ; and as a test of the weight and importanceof such aids, I request the reader to turnto these respective names in the " INDEX" and tosee how they each stand out and shine forth. . . " velut inter ignesLuna minores."I have endeavoured to express my sense of thankfulnessfor such and other aids in the preface to thework*. Those arising from "at home," were theembodying of all that was useful in my previouslyprivately printed tracts* as well as from a collectionof extracts, memoranda, letters, and a varietyneeded by One who will have dug infinitely deeper below the surface ofthat soil of which they may be said to have comparatively only tuntrdup the turf, or upper stratum. With" what sincere gratification didI learn (when meeting my friend at his annual visits with myself atAlthorp) that the late Sir James Mackintosh had declared that "he shouldbe proud to carry a straw towards the erection of such a building asTHAT which Mr. Petrie was then occupied in raisiiur."It is not a little singular that, in the fourth, and by far the richest,part of the library of the late Mr. Hebe, there will scarcely be foundone rare poetical tract, or piece, but what has been more or less noticedin the " Library Companion" or in the 3rd and 4th volumes of the7 '/// < ></ graphical A antiquities."t See page 338, ante.718 PUBLICATIONS CONTINUED.

The pearlswere all loose in a large box and I had only tostring those, as from Ceylon, which should maintaintheir lustre for the longest period. It was necessaryto give the text a sort of readable character, as I feltpretty confident about the notes ; and I am willingto believe that this point has been accomplished.The departments of Divinity, History, Voyages andTravels, and Poetry, were those which required aminuter attention, and exacted a greater labour.Some of the notes were incorporated and written inavery small hand, measuring four feet of copy whenextended, and poor Batsford* used to growl dreadfullyas he held them up to the Compositor !There was, however, one thing which I thoughtneedful before publication and that was, a Dedicationof the Work either to some " Young Man," orOld Man." My thoughts at first were naturallydirected in the former channel, to the Hon. andReverend George Spencer, youngest Son of thevenerable Earl to whom the " Spencer Library"had been as naturally inscribed ; but Mr. Spencernot only declined the intended honour with a delicacypeculiarly his own, but approved, and evenapplauded the choice of the " Old Man," to whomSee page 602, ante.t In a second letter upon this subject after having, in his firstdeclined the acceptance of the offer of the dedication, my amiable correspondentwrote thus : " I was anxious to look at the page next to theCompanion'] PUBLICATIONS CONTINUED. 719the volume was in fact inscribed. And that venerableindividual was the late Mr. THOMAS PAYNE*.When the volume was ripe for publicity, the Publisherannounced and subscribed it at what is calleda trade sale ; and I own that the number of copies(twelve hundred) subscribed for, exceeded my mostsanguine expectations. I had however a few confidentialanticipations. My friends at the corner ofCornhill had not only had a "peep behind thecurtain," but had expressed themselves well pleasedwith what they saw; while the more interested butsharp and critical examination of that bookseller,whose name stands at the foot of the title-page ofthe volume and whose name, ALONE, I am as proudTitle, as you may suppose ; and I think the name which appears in it,in every way and on all accounts, most suitable : much more so thanthat of a certain other person that shall be nameless. In fact, I don'tthink you could have chosen better ; and a very kind and proper feelingappears in it knowing, as all do, the kind of intercourse whichyou have always had with that veteran Bibliopole."The Dedication is simply thus " To Mr. THOMAS PAYNE, Bookseller,this Work is inscribed, with every sentiment of respect andesteem, by his faithful and humble servant, the AUTHOR." This excellentman, and highly respectable Bookseller, died in 1833, in his 79th year.What is said of him in the Bibliophobia, p. 28, is said truly as well asfeelingly, " and he is yet before me," as he rose and spake the " Z ds"recorded in a preceding page : 550. But another word of him in anensuing Chapter.t " We are much obliged (says Mr. John Arch) by the sheets of theL.

Some squeamish Sentimentalisthad attacked the pure memory of ISAAC WALTON by an indirect imputationof cruelty from the apparent cold-blooded minuteness withwhich his instructions are given for fastening the frog and the wormbaits. Mr. Major fired up at the supposed charge and his Muse dictatedto him the following vigorous couplets on the occasion :Go, hypocrite ! indulge thy secret hateOf ah 1 that's open, manly, good and great ;For slight obliquities affect remorse,But act enormities as things of course.Spare the blunt insect from thy just control,And save thy tortures for the human soul.Strike at mans heart; and then serenely sleepAssured the wound is exquisite as deep."But Mr. Major has since taken loftier ground as a Bookseller and Publisher,in coming forward, conjointly with Messrs.

Perfectly persuaded, as well ofthe upright spirit of my book, as of my motives inits publication, I felt quite sure that the former couldnot give the slightest possible offence, nor the latterreceive an improper construction. As before, I wasswift to acknowledge obligations by presents of copiesof the work to those who had aided me during itsconcoction, or to whom I stood in that sort of relativesituation as should seem at once to call forand to justify such a mark of its acknowledgment.Of the first description, there was in fact no oneso thoroughly entitled to it, as my excellent friendMr. Amyot: of the latter, the Bishop of Londonand of Norwich, and the Earl of Liverpool* hadthe only claims.

I have also seen the critique upon itin the Monthly Magazine. The editor seems to have mistaken theobject of the work : it is intended for the use of gentlemen, and notmechanics ; and I cannot help fancying, when reading the MonthlyMagazine, that I am in the company of a strange sort of people ; suchas tax-gatherers, with pen in mouth good sort of men hearty fellowsin worsted stockings clumsy fists black waistcoats with whitestars ; whose conversation is made up of General Washington Buonapartefine fellows politics grumble grumble steam engines patentmachines to feed workhouse brats. f A penny saved is a penny got,' aspoor Richard says : ' patent fences, which break cows legs &c. &c.The Gentleman's Magazine is a very different work, and is excellent.I.

We had been neighbours and friends atKensington, and occasional oppositionists at vestrymeetings. In fact, we were as pitted champions in thedisputatious arena of those uproarious assemblagesof the human race. Sometimes he was the Demosthenes,and I was the Aeschines of the day : at othertimes, it was vice verse. I forget who bore the palmwhen the crown was awarded to the victorious championof eloquence.Almost simultaneously with the exhibition of thejudicial powers of the British Critic, appeared the"Censure" in the WESTMINSTER REVIEW the mostelaborate, but the most violent and vituperative of allthe reviews of the work in question. Nothing, frombeginning to end, can exceed the solemn fopperyand fierce invective of this piece of composition.There should seem to have been, in the motto or ruleassumed by the writer of it, the following wordsborrowed from the Trachinice of SOPHOCLES :*raw* c/toO KryaeiV. 477-8.Indeed that very writer himself may be thus described,in the language of the same great dramatist :BXcVw reap \0pov 0uvra, ital-rax'liv KatcSt?T\WV, & STJ KttKOvpryoi egtKon' i' /}/<."V. 1061.The latter is from the Ajax Flogellifer no bad designationof this splenetic Soils himself.

Intentionally, by inference, by word ofmouth, or in deed, I never gave him cause of offence.I once assisted him in some trifling directions, ratherthan instructions, in a meditated trip to Munich ;and I have openly praised several of his contributionsto the RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW *, of which hewas the reputed Editor. He has shown a gratefulsense of such conduct on my part.But severity, or rather vituperation, was " theorder of the day ; " and down came the QuarterlyReview upon my heterodox volume. Now, as aReview, strictly speaking, is the opinion only of onewriter, I might have rested, and did in fact rest,satisfied with those commendatory opinions fromcharacters of undoubted literary distinction, withwhich the preceding pages have abounded ; but assuch opinion, when incorporated in a large body ofcriticism or collection of opinions in one volume,or journal, gains an additional force, its effect,whether in favour of, or in opposition to, the workreviewed, is apt to be more influential. This I believeis the secret history of almost all reviews,and of the sensitiveness of authors in consequence.Moreover, there are some people who have no eyesof their own to perceive, or judgments to exerciseor depend upon, in the perusal of an author. Theymust borrow the intellectual optics of others.

From theQuarterly, I had both right and reason to expect atleast " fair play." The principles of my book werein strict consonance with those of the establishedchurch and state. I had impugned no rites andceremonies which had been sanctioned by time andpractised by the learned and the good. I had bespatteredno gentleman with the dirt and filth ofslander and detraction ; nor had I, on the otherhand, been the slave of a sneaking hypocrisy. I hadcompromised no just and liberal principle. Myheart dictated what my pen indited. Moreover, thepublisher of the Quarterly Review had been knownto me for a long period even during his residencein Fleet Street, where, for the first time, I met hisfriend Mr. D'Israeli at dinner. Mr. Murray'sfather had been one of the publishers of my unfortunatevolume of poems ; and had shewn kindness aswell as readiness in the bibliopolistic patronage conferred.In Fleet Street the Quarterly Review tookits birth. I had watched, with anxiety and evenfondness, its first struggles for distinction its earliestefforts at flight. I saw it flapping the groundwith the tips of its wings, till, confident in thestrength of its pinions, it soared, eagle-like, in theblue sky .Para met prime ; mox sese attollit in auras."I had in an especial manner noticed many of itsSB740 PUBLICATIONS CONTINUED.

That it did not lay inthe breast of the Publisher to have softened suchacrimony, or to have diverted or omitted the attackaltogether, is a position which I cannot bring myselfto admit ; for I know that such interventionhas been, both before and since, indisputably andeffectually exercised by the Publisher and Proprietorof the Review. I must be among the weakest ofmankind to take any protestation to the contrary, asbased upon truth. Who the then Editor was, I canhave as little curiosity to know as inclination torespect. The report was, he was " a Gentleman ofthe Law." A member of the profession he mighthave been ; but the genius and the judgment of itslate editor, Mr. Gifford, certainly did not appearto possess his successor. He might have put thehelmet of Minerva upon his head, but the bird ofinspiration did not grace its front. It should seem,however, that matters had a disposition at that timeto retrograde at head quarters, and that there was a"screw loose" somewhere. In consequence, thefollowing and sixty-fourth number of the QuarterlyReview came out under fresh editorial auspices. Agentleman succeeded who not only brought with himPUBLICATIONS CONTINUED. 741a large share of necessary experience in the mechanicalmanagement of a periodical journal, butsuperadded genius, taste, and eloquence ; a poet, anovelist, and a practised critic.

But so it was and duringthat time I must have necessarily seen manyshifting, and changes, and losses, and gains, in thecircle in which I moved ; together with numerousalterations in the external face of things.

Mr. Delafield was a sensible and highly respectableman. His house was enfiladed by two avenues of elm-trees, of beautifuleffect, at a given distance ; and the house, though small for hisestablishment, had the snug and picturesque air of a country villa.Now, all is changed. The elms have disappeared ; a brick wall encirclesthe garden; and the tube of the astronomer is nightly levelled atthe stare, where, erst, the quiet rubber and the pi tit souper resuscitatedand enlivened the parting guest.

He was agentleman and a scholar, and a man of a broad andliberal understanding. His amalgamation of whiggishand toryism was admirably managed, so as tooffend neither party ; and during the threatened invasionof this country, by Bonaparte, my friend Mr.Willis, (par courtoise Colonel) who was the secondin command of the Kensington Volunteers, (MajorTorriano being the Colonel), felt as gallantly and aseagerly disposed to cut off the head of the Invaderas the Right Honourable William Pitt himself.His loyalty was not to be questioned; but hewould pin his faith, and fasten his creed, upon noman's sleeve, unless he had liberty to form and todefend it to the utmost as the result of his ownunblessed conviction. There was no slavish suc-currencyabout him to any man, however exaltedby rank or condition. At one time he was consideredto have been intimate with the Princeafterwards George IV. ; but he would cultivate nosociety where there was not a thorough congenialityof feeling.

Mr. Williswas very much above the ordinary run of gentlemen-scholars; and, like the present venerable Bishop ofNorwich, having an aptitude in quoting Latin prose,he would frequently, in my hearing, give us manyeloquent passages from Livy an author to whomhe was particularly attached.

But I cast myeyes around for a more lofty object of professionalambition. The Philanthropic Chapel was justerected, and, as usual, scores of Candidates were inmotion. There was no chance.

He was opinionated,dogmatical, and, at times, overbearing. There was only one dictum towhich he, apparently, deferred and that was, the opinion of the manby whose instrumentality he is reported to have become the successorof Mr. Artie, as Keeper of the Records in the Tower of London ; asituation of equal respectability and responsibility, and not destitute ofa substantial revenue. The " man" here alluded to, was the late SirJoseph Banks. Mr. Lysons could " bear no rival near his throne."Few men intrigued so deeply in all matters connected with the Societyof Antiquaries ; and to oppose him was to seal your own doom, if youhad any material object to accomplish.

See this curious matter referred to in the Bibliomania,page 61, note.But this is NOT Mr. Tyson's " due," because the more commendablepart of his public character ought not to be withheld. He was ardent,active, and indefatigable in all measures which he believed to be conduciveto the Society's credit and well-doing. He had scarcely a rivalin antiquarian and tasteful acquirements. He had a ready pencil and afaithful needle; and he etched with the facility that he drew. Youmight depend upon the general truth and character of all that came fromhis pencil. His productions were numerous, for their labour and expense.In the " Environs of London," in which he largely assisted hisBrother, the author of the work, he may be said to have scarcely donemore than executed an elegant outline of an interesting picture.

He was the Crib of all antagonists, " never knowing whenhe had had enough." His works are indispensable to all well-selectedlibraries.It has been a matter of surprise to me, that, to the active and enterprisingmind of the late Mr. Samuel Lysons, it never struck him thatthe appendage of a MUSEUM to the Society of Antiquaries might beboth an appropriate and a highly instructive appendage. There wouldbe only two modes of accomplishing this : a grant or loan of money, inthe first instance, and a subscription of I/, per annum from each member,to cover the loan and contribute to occasional contributions.

They looked forwardto "another and another still succeeding," withan absolute " increase of appetite," which seemed togrow by what it fed upon." The blaze of his prosehas now perhaps reduced his poetry to a fainter tint ;but Sir Walter Scott is the second of modern poetsonly because Lord Byron is the first. What a preludeto his Marion, and the Lady of the Lake,was his Lay of the Last Minstrel the most finished,as well as elaborated, of all his poems.

But surely no more pleasurableexcitements ever took place in the breast of thepublic, than on the announcements, and yet more onthe deliveries, of the quarto volumes of these immortalpoems ! poems, in which a strict principleof morality is combined with the loftiest romanticdaring ; in which virtue can be yet braver, and morebeautiful, than vice ; and in which all the stirringsympathies of kind and of country are most singularlydeveloped, and pressed home upon the bosomof the enchanted reader.

It was represented, when Isaw it, after the play of Rob Roy . . . when Mr. Macready walked acrossthe stage in the very dress in which he had played that character witha discrimination and force to leave all rivalry at a distance.I yet hope to see a good bulky octavo volume, entitled SCOTTIANA,developing all those curious, amusing, and collateral circumstances connectedwith the literary life of this GREAT MAN. Mr. Lockhart will doubtlessdo much ; but his line is more direct and exclusively biographical.Two things were always the attendant upon the introduction of the subjectof Sir Walter Scott's Novels : first, who was the AUTHOR ? secondly,which was the MOST DELIGHTFUL ? I remember being privy to ratheran angry discussion upon the first point : a Lady having boldly declaredthat they were written by one of her sex, an American, and regularlytransmitted from Baltimore across the Atlantic ! This was indeed verydroll! . . . but cheeks reddened, and eyes flashed fire during the discussion.Had it been from " the sterner sex," something else mighthave also " flashed fire !"

I have saidthat our acquaintance originated (as our friendshipwas afterwards confirmed) upon "very extraordinarygrounds." Thus it was. Opposite to methere lived an amiable lady, a widow, whose husbandhad been lost at sea off the Cape in that terriblestorm in which Admiral Trowbridge went down inthe Blenheim that vessel being the convoying shipto a large fleet of East India Merchantmen. Shewas about to retire into Kent, with a numerous littlefamily, and to economise upon what her stintedincome allowed. The bill for the letting of herhouse was affixed to the window, and some tradesmenhad also a written notice of her intendeddeparture.It chanced that Mr. Neunburg, who was awidower, and a retired City Merchant, had takenup his quarters at the King's Arms Coffee House,at Kensington ; being not only desirous of changeof air, but of a small commodious residence in theimmediate neighbourhood. By accident, he calledwhere there was an announcement of my friend'shouse about to be let. He was directed to the houseit-elf; its owner happening to be at the time engaged760 KENSINGTONIANA.at dinner. He examined the furniture, attendedby the Servant expressed himself well satisfiedwith what he saw, and asked, on retiring, for herMistress ? He received an answer that she couldnot then, conveniently, see him 5 but if he wouldcall on the morrow, the business might be furthergone into. He called on the morrow. Not Edwardthe Fourth could have been more struck with thepresence of Elizabeth Woodville, than Mr. N. waswith my opposite neighbour. She was in truth ahandsome woman, and in the prime of life. TheVisitor had turned his sixtieth year.He ran his eye quickly, but confusedly, over theseveral items of furniture, and expressed himselfentirely satisfied with the charges " but, Madam"(said he, addressing himself directly to the fair mistressof the house, who at the time was surroundedby her large and blooming family), " there is ONE,and, as it strikes me, the MOST ESSENTIAL, piece offurniture which you have omitted ? " Now few mencould assume a more gentlemanly air, and tone ofvoice, than the Visitor in question. The lady couldnot comprehend what was meant or alluded to. Shethought there had been a strange neglect in makingout the Inventory, and begged the unknown "wouldbe more explicit?" "Madam," rejoined that unknown," CAN I be more explicit ? On what objectare my eyes fixed upon, BUT YOURSELF . in makingthis declaration? You will forgive me, but I speakas I feel." I would here ask the most experiencedKENS1NGTON1ANA. 761of novel readers, or novel writers, whether " theRomance of real life" furnished anything moreromantic than THIS? But so it was and withinsix months of this memorable interview, the partiesbecame man and wife at Kensington Church theceremony having been performed by myself.Mr. Neunburg took his Bride down to his mansionat Stamford, in Lincolnshire, where he had long resided,and ably and faithfully performed the dutiesof a magistrate for the twenty preceding years. Hewas the very next neighbour to the Marquis ofExeter, whose park enfiladed the back part of hishouse. His connexion with the late Marquis continueduninterrupted till the day of the death of thelatter ; and more than upon one occasion of electiondid my friend's influence with the freeholders ofStamford stand the Marquis in "good stead." Iwas not long in paying a visit to the " Happy Pair,"and found them not only extremely well disposed togive me the warmest reception, but the Library * ofthe bridegroom had more than ordinary attractionsto prolong my sojourn.

My expedition with him to Dash, the bookseller,at Kettering, is recorded in the Biog. Cameron, vol. ii. p. 53 ;and his precious little volume of a collection of black-letter Catechismsis described at page 528-9. This was the last book I ever put into thehands of the late Bishop of Ely, who seemed to devour it, as he placedit upon a shelf within reach.

Theaffectionate attention of Mr. Neunburg never forone moment knew diversion or decay. He died inhis seventy-second year in 1822, and was followedby his widow in 1831 * after sustaining her protractedsufferings with christian-like fortitude andresignation.Towards the year 18 14 I quitted my residence inHornton for one at the top of Hornton Street thenjust newly built ; and although my house was verylittle larger, the situation was more airy and agreeable: for nothing intercepted my view of the avenuecrack volume of black-letter rarity, in my friend Mr. Neunburg's library,was, Fullest's Flower of Fame, which was sold for 30/. 9*., at the saleof his library after his decease, which sale produced 1750/. Many anhour have I tarried with the owner in his library : many a draweropened : many a shelf cleared, filled, cleared, and filled again. He wasdelightfully exulting over his fine and perfect copy of Bentley's Monumentsof Matrons; or, Seven several Lamps of Virginity, 1582, 4to. ;Nichols' History of Leicestershire, which was sold for 51 1. 9s. ; and,above all, his Illustrated Granger, which produced 210/. But myhospitable friend had as curious a cellar as a library ; and, open-heartedand generous to excess, was himself little beyond a sipper and taster ofvinous fluids. Some few dozens of champagne and burgundy wereone day denounced as acid and worthless : " I'm glad they are not myBOOKS" . . . was his only reply.Mrs. Neunburg's second son is now Rector of Carlton Scroop, nearGraham.

It was in many respects a desirableand cheerful residence. I had not long enteredit, when my friend FRANCIS DOUCE, Esq., came topitch his tent in Kensington Square, so as to reconcileme yet more to having resisted all attacks andappeals for transferring my Penates to London.The reader has been repeatedly introduced to Mr.Douce in the previous pages in the character of anHistoriographer*, in which he certainly maintainsno despicable reputation.

Yet it was surprisinghow, in a great measure, he lived by such a rule,and harassed himself, in very many instances, inconsequence.Of this indiscretion, my amiable and generousfriend was not, strictly speaking, fully sensible ; buthe was nevertheless an eminently amiable and generousman. The gentle attentions and civil courtesiesshewn to him by Dr. Bandied and others, at theBodleian Library, secured to that magnificent establishmentthe bequest of his library. The cordialhospitality extended to him by Sir Samuel RushMeyrick, at his residence in Monmouthshire, wonthe visitor's heart ; and his collection of curiosities,antiquities, &c., were bequeathed to his host in consequence: so that there must have been no smallsusceptibility or consciousness of kindnesses and .765mentions bestowed, on the part of Mr. Douce*. Myfriend died a very rich man, although a dozen yearsbefore his death he was scarcely in possession of afifth of what he left behind ; with the exception ofhis library and curiosities. It may be doubtedwhether his peace of mind was not a little broken,and his serenity of temper a good deal ruffled, bythe NOLLEKENS LEGACY. I do not think that hewas ever afterwards so happy as he was beforenotwithstanding his increased ability to meet all thetaxes which the state and the parish might imposeupon him! Indeed I have the evidence of his ownconfession in writing, that this suggestion is but toowell founded. A portion of a letter, written undergreat morbidity of feeling, ends thus :Upper Gower Street, 26th April, 1828.MY DEAR FRIEND,* * * * *How strangely things go in this incomprehensible world !Y<>u keep up your spirits amidst occasional adversity.

He concludes :66 I might as well attempt to fly as to walk to you on sucha day as this which, while it enlivens other INSECTS, para-linesME.Yours, ever most cordially,F. DOUCE."Such is the dispensation of things which reconcilesus to our thatched roofs and our " dinners ofherbs." The letter was in all respects teeming withpersonal kindness towards me. What was rathersingular, I saw my friend the very morning when hewas fastening on his sabots to go to London to hearNollekens's will read ; and quietly observed to him,in the ignorance of my heart, " I hope you havenot been for gotten ? " He was remembered . to theamount of 50,000/. and was carried through all thecontingent expenses and worries of law litigation witha high and triumphant hand, by a common friend,who was certainly not over-rewarded by two of thelegatees for the trouble and difficulties encountered t.The same kind of feeling possessed him a dozen years before ; forthus most considerately did he express himself to me, in one of hisletters of this date, on the loss of my younger son : " I am apparentlyusing you very ill, in not noticing, otherwise than through Mr. Ellis,your obliging letter and Catalogue Raisonne of Hearne's Pieces ; butI really forbore to molest you, until I thought time had, in some degree,mitigated the affliction you have undergone, and for which, indeed,I am most heartily sorry ; I cannot doubt that you submit with fortitudeto measures, to us INSCRUTABLE, but undoubtedly JUST."t I allude to what all our common acquaintance know full well theexertions, as well as discretion and judgment, displayed by JAMES HeywoodMaryland, Esq. I could have wished, in addition to the honorKNSINOTONIANA. 767It will be over and over again imagined that Mr.Douce, as a sensitive man, would be obnoxious toall external, as well as internal, nuisances. Hehappened to be the neighbour of the late Mr. Cobbett: that is to say, their gardens, behind, joined ;or rather a brick wall only separated them. Cobbettkept dogs to protect his property. My friend complainedbitterly of their barking by day and howlingby night. In return, his neighbour thought he hada more serious cause of complaint or charge againstMr. Douce, for he threatened to bring an actionagainst him on account of the trespasses committedby his slugs and snails. The mind of my friendfired up at this imputation, and he sought counseland advice in the following truly original effusionfurnished me by our common friend.Kensington, 28th April, 1825.MY DEAR SIR,Will you believe that I am menaced with an action ofdamages from Mr. Cobbett, as to whom I am more ' sinnedagainst than sinning He complains that he has sufferedimmense loss by the migration of the snails and slugs frommy garden into his ; and that I do not feed them at homeby cultivating my ground in a proper manner.

THAT was eminently richand curious : and its owner might have been calledthe Ballet or the La Monroe of his day. Not abook but what had its fly-leaf written upon.

Such is the spirit-stirring language of my friend, Dr. Ban-dine,who adds, that " when all the books and papers, on which theyare catalogued, are numbered, we shall instantly go to press." Thesooner the better, rejoin I. Among the books which grace this veryvaluable, if not extraordinary, collection, is ONE upon which I desiresomewhat to pause. Look, gentle reader, at the OPPOSITE PLATE.

I had purchased it of Mr. Trip-hookfor 20.

It wasconcerning his conjecture about the exact meaning of Lady Macbeth'sexhortation to her husband, to " screw his courage to the sticking-place."My friend had a crotchet that this referred to the formationof certain daggers in inflicting a mortal blow.

By rushing out for medical aid, I immediatelyobtained that assistance which, in the end,wrought his cure. His life at that moment seemedscarcely worth twenty-four hours purchase. He recovered,and was never again subjected to epilepsy.But his hour came at last within some ten or twelveyears afterwards. Scarcely six months had elapsedfrom his telling me of the death of our commonfriend Mr. Hebe*, when he himself became thevictim to the " irresistible summons." I knew littleor nothing about his illness till within a fortnight ofhis demise. His bodily suffering was, I believe,great. It was evident, too, that the intellects wereyielding to the inroads which disease was makingupon the body. On his decease, his man-servantbegged that I would see his master ere the lid ofthe coffin was irrevocably fastened. I did sohesitatingly and reluctantly; but I had seen a latecommon friend t in the same situation, and whyshould I shrink from contemplating those featureswhich had never been turned towards either of usbut in expressions of affectionate friendship?

His WILL was more thana"nine days* wonder*.The WILL of FRANCIS DOUCE, Esq., is no longer matter of secrethistory. Its publication in the pages of the Gentleman's Magazine forAugust, 1834,, renders it of general cognizance. To that publication isprefixed a memoir of the testator, of which Mr. W. W. Singer is thereputed author. There were sufficient motives, both on the score ofzeal and gratitude, for such a memoir j which might indeed have beenof yet more copious dimensions for its author had been remembered,by the subject of it, not only with a legacy of 500/., but. by being appointedone of two residuary legatees, and by reaping the fruits of somewhereabout 22,000/. by such appointment ! while three nephews, fromthe loins of his OWN BROTHER, found a remembrance of not one-fifth partof such sum. The remaining co-legatee was the Rev. Edward Goddard,a friend from early youth, of about the same closeness of alliance as Mr.Singer. To the brief memoir of the deceased by the latter, a reply byA LOVER OP JUSTICE," appeared in the month of October in the sameMagazine. This reply not only contains sharp words, but home-truths,and should seem to have been the production of one of thenephews ; if so, it might have dealt out heavier blows.In the will of Mr. Douce 1 found myself a legatee to the amount of500/., bating the duty. I will honestly confess that I was wholly unpreparedfor it ; neither syllable nor sentence, by word of mouth or bypen, ever having in the least taught me to expect such a solid mark ofmy friend's remembrance. His will was made in 1831, on the death ofhis wife. The legacies in money were about thirty in number, amountingto somewhere under 10,000/. The property was sworn to be under80,000/. The harvest of the co-legatees could not, therefore, be called ascanty one. In the absence of relationship, but on the footing of an oldand affectionate friend, I do not pretend to that puling affectation tosay, that " I little merited" what was bequeathed me ; for, as far as themerit of a respectful attention, and a cordial sympathy in very manytastes, and for some twenty-five years, went, I gave only the same"valuable consideration" for the gift as either of the two residuarylegatees. And further, in no one instance did I, or would I, surrenderto him, my departed friend, the free exercise of my own thought, or ofmy own expression, by word of mouth or by pen. Indeed, we wouldsometimes have skirmishes which gave indication of an approachingbattle.But, sitting down to exercise the opinion of an experienced and .777The settlement of my friend WILLIAM Yoi \<,OTTLEY, Esq., in Pliillimore Place, was another ofpassionate friend, upon the spirit and tendency of this WILL, I cannothold back the expression of my deep regret that it was not ennobled andadorned by SOME remembrances which would have helped to canonisethe memory of the Testator. The reader may hence account for thecapricious lights and shades of his character: those crotchets impulses,and immoveable prejudices, above mentioned in the text, whichpeculiarly distinguished him. Surely, his OWN BLOOD might have receivedat least one third of the whole Property ?

But he may be remembered by the co-residuarylegatees ! I will hope it . I will believe it. This, however, I do believe,and will as solemnly avow . . . that if I had been one of them, God'sblessed sun should not have shed its evening's rays on my pillow withouta communication imparted to that old friend of the deceased thatan annuity of a hundred pounds per annum should be paid him by mybrother trustee and self, as long as he lived or, in default of thatbrother, he should have fifty from myself ! The heart of man, be heking or subject, is inscrutable.The bequeathing of papers, including letters, memoranda, diaries,&c., not to be opened till the year 1900, is a sad instance, of the manyon record, of a foolish and unworthy disposition of property : implyingas much cowardice and conceit as discretion and candour. If thesepapers contain useful intelligence, why not benefit the present generation? If otherwise the inference is that they may be only a secondedition of the slander and misrepresentation of COLE. Even to thelast at least, while making his will three years before his death he wasnot divested of his " crotchets." His friend, Sir Anthony Carlisle, thesurgeon, is requested, in that will, to sever his head from his body, ortnki' <>nt his heart, to prevent the "return of vitality." Here he tooka leaf out of the book of his old friend and co-residuary legatee, .Mr.Enrich, who had even requested the same operation to be performedin the presence of his SON !

On more accounts than one Iam well pleased, if not proud, to call that settlementto recollection. Mr. Ottley and myself had, in manyrespects, kindred pursuits. I believe I was the firstto infect him with the bibliomaniacal disease ormania as it respected enquiries into the Origin ofPrinting ; but at no time was I resolved to go tosuch great and fearful lengths as he was pleased topush that subject, in relation to the claims of Holland.Indeed, whenever the COSTER-FEVER wasfully upon him, I usually made my escape ; for hewas dangerous of approach unless he were copiouslyblooded*. But it is not so much on thisaccount that I call the residence of my neighbour,Mr. Ottley, to a pleasurable " reminiscence :" it is,on the contrary, because through my instrumentalityhe became engaged with Messrs. Arch to executehis noble work upon the History of Engraving,It was at my house, some time in 1813, before the sale of theMerely Library, that Mr. Ottley was induced to institute his enquiriesabout fixing the dates of the block books, in consequence of seeing in thatcollection a Dutch and a Latin edition of the Speculum. These enquirieswere carried out at full length, and triumphantly proved in his workupon Engraving ; because the conclusions were drawn from the verysingular evidence of the Cuts. But he is now busily engaged in bringingout an ex professor work upon the same subject, in 4 to., illustratedwith a profusion of most curious engravings j the result of which workis to annihilate the claims of Strasbourg and Mente, and to establishthe first rocking of the cradle of the Art of Printing in Holland orHarlem applied, however, to the furnishing of merely elementaryworks upon education.KENSINOTONIANA. 779in two quarto volumes; a work, of which LordSpencer was well pleased to accept the Dedicationto Himself.And of yet higher " pith and moment" to myfeelings, was my friend's extraordinary collection ofPrints ; and most curious assemblage of Pictures,chiefly ancient of which some reached the periodof Giotto and Cimabue. These latter ought to becomeNational Property, as containing the germ orelements of Art upon which Raffaelle, while gazing,might have caught more than a common sparkof inspiration*. My friend is now, with great propriety,enrolled among the intellectual " officers" ofThis extraordinary collection of ancient pictures gives us no faintor unsatisfactory idea of the restoration of the Art of Painting, from itsdawning at Pisa and Florence, in the middle of the 13th century, andat the beginning of the 14th, under Giunta Pisano, Cimabue, Ugolinoda Siena, Giotto, &c., to the close of the 15th century, when Leonardoda Vinci, Fra Bartolommeo, Michel Angelo, and Raffaelle shone forth,perfecting the Art. There are yet, however, in this curious collectionsome earlier and connecting steps, upon which the student may walkwith equal surprise and gratification ; for my friend possesses three orfour very curious Greek pictures, executed from the 8th to the 13thcentury ; one or two of them being in encaustic. The other, Florentine,pictures, are all, with the exception of one (in fresco) painted indistemper ; or, to use the Italian phrase, a tempera.I can conscientiously, because truly, add, that this collection has beencarefully examined by competent critics foreigners as well as natives ;and that in pronouncing it to be worth some few thousand pounds, itmust be remembered that this valuation is made under the fixed impressionthat such ANOTHER collection could not be got together. Now,we are building a NATIONAL MUSEUM, or GALLERY, of some 400 feetin KiiLrth.

The Museumdoes itself honour by the enrolment : for, added tohis critical powers*, Mr. Ottley is himself an artistmade up of all the stirring elements of the MichaelAngelo school. His " Fall of Satan," or conflictbetween the host of heaven and hell, supplied bythe text of Milton, has scarcely been equalled byany living artist t. It breathes of the genius of thatgreat man, whom, in frequent converse with his latefriend, Mr. Fuseli, I have heard " our Ottley" placealoft in a state of beatification which the Mantuabard could scarcely have described . as reposingamongancona viretaFortunatus decorum, sedesque beats."My friend very soon and very successfully gave proof that thetreasures of ancient art, scattered, in the character of illuminations,through the myriads of volumes in the British Museum, had attractionswhich might be made instrumental to public instruction. A Latinversion, by Cicero, of the astronomical poem of Aratus, written inminuscules, or small lower-case roman letters, happened to have illuminationswhich caught Mr. Ottley's eye, as being indicative of art ofthe fourth century, before the time of Constantine. It has long beenan established rule (from Pavillon downwards) that minuscules couldnot be pushed up beyond the lath century; but Mr. Ottley has uponthe whole successfully combatted this position in a long and learneddissertation read to the Society of Antiquaries, and illustrated by plates,which has been just published in the Archaeological. The scription ortext seems here to be a secondary question ; as it might have beenwritten upon the vellum which had long previously contained the illuminations.Upon the whole, my friend has produced a very preciousmorsel for hungry dilettante to feed upon.t It was exhibited at Somerset House, and is executed in black andwhite crayons, upon paper of a blue ground, measuring some five feetin length by four in height.K ! NSINOTONIANA. 781The mention of Mr. Ottley reminds me of thelate Sir Thomas Lawrence, his especial and mostintimate friend ; to attend whose obsequies he cameover express from Holland, where he had beenpushing his researches, with unabated ardour, tosubstantiate the claims of his beloved Coster. Imet Sir Thomas several times at the table of an oldcollege-friend, Col. Wesley, then living on this sideof Hammersmith, in a pleasant sort of Tusculum,not vehemently encroached upon by brick, mortar,or lath and plaster. The trees were sufficientlygreen, and the sky continued to exhibit, now andthen, some lapis-lazuli tints; which, to Mrs. Wesley,a very extraordinary artist in oil painting, could notfail to have their decided uses. I remember once,after dining in company with Sir Thomas, at ourcommon friend's on returning home in his chariot,I took occasion to observe to him that my aunt,Mrs. William Compton (already introduced to thereader's acquaintance * ) had known him when quitea lad, at Devises, and had thrown off some stanzasin praise of him on the sight of a red-chalk drawingof a subject from Homer, executed by himfrom a print by Roland, after Angelica Kauffman.Sir Thomas Lawrence drew most beautifully for histender years. I asked him if he would like to hearlhe<e verses for about a dozen years before I hadcaused them to be printed in the European Magazine.He said he should be well pleased so to do.Page 65, ante.782 KENSINGTONIANA.I repeated only the two following stanzas for Ireally had, and still have, forgotten the remainder.Go on, sweet youth, the glorious task pursue ;On Emulation's wing let Fancy soar ;Depicture Nature in its loveliest viewWhat could a Raffaelle or a Reynolds more !LAWRENCE the name to future years shall liveShall greatly live till Time's Memorial dies :Merit to merit shall its tribute give,And Italy's proud Sons yield up the prize."On concluding this recitation, Sir Thomas, withsingular aptitude, and with only a slight perversion,or addition, replied : " Thou knowest the mask ofnight is on my face, else would a mantling blushbepaint my cheek."My subsequent intercourse with Sir Thomas Lawrence was ratherslender,, even when I came to settle in town. We lived far apart, andit might be almost said of both of us " nulla dies sine LINEA." To thepublication of Thomas a Kempis he became a subscriber, as will beseen in a subsequent page. The last time I called upon him, and sawhim, was, when he was touching a proof of the mezzotint of Charles X.from his own portrait of that ill-fated monarch. " You see (said he) thatpainters and authors are at least alike in touching up a proof sheet" Hetold me he had been four hours upon it. It was surprising to see howhis touches (in black and white chalk) told. His WORKS are the propertyof the whole civilised world. The Royal collection may boast of hisfinest picture all things considered. It is the HAMLET, for which theportrait of the late Mr. Kemble furnished the physiognomical representation.It is altogether a thing apart unearthly : the mind and soul of thefigure being as it were concentrated in heaven. How beautifully drawnthe latter, and with what appropriate accompaniments !

It is rather extraordinary thatReynolds's finest (portrait) picture, should be the Sister of this india783But Kensington need not have boasted of the flyingvisits of Sir Thomas Lawrence to connect it,however remotely, with the fine arts. It had solid,stationary, and as it were indigenous, claims to attentionand admiration. Here lived WILKIE ; andhere lived Alcott : names, of great and glowingreputation that gave a sort of sunny tint to thewhole neighbourhood. I was intimate and thoughfate has of late years locally severed us I amwilling to believe that I am yet intimate with boththese illustrious Artists : quite, as I conceive, at thehead of their respective departments. There wasthis marked peculiarity or difference in their mannerof work. Mr. Alcott never cared how much youtalked with him while he was painting*. Mr.vidual, who here appears in all the dignity of tragic garb and expression.But we must not institute comparisons. It is a glory for eachindividual to have been instrumental to the exercise of the pencil of thegreatest artists, in their respective days, in its happiest effort. When Isay this, I do not forget the pencil of Lawrence in two other delineationsof the same great actor ; the one as Coriolanus, the other as Holla. Theformer was exhibited in 1798, and I yet possess a manuscript criticismupon it, made of materials supplied while standing opposite the picture.Of this I had personal experience on visiting him while he wasoccupied with his Pool of London and View off Dover; the former,one of his most surprising and successful efforts. With what delightdo I call to mind his Water-mill more than the dawn of that transcendantmerit by which the majority of his pictures is distinguished ! Ilove his gray tints, his quiet skies, his cool shadows, his refluent waves,and his classical groups . the latter more especially designated in hialate Italian views ! The first of his pictures, of the latter kind, may besaid to have, in a manner, transfixed me. The Caracas could not haveexhibited finer grouping, nor Claude himself a more delicious Italiansky and atmosphere. While fixed before it (I think it was a view ofBologna or of Florence), a foreigner, who had been eyeing it very KENSINGTONIANA.Wilkie, to my knowledge (and my visits to him,from his contiguity, were more frequent than to histalented neighbour), never exercised the brush atany one visit which I paid him and yet I haveseen the progress of execution of very many of hismore celebrated pictures *. The first sketch of JohnKnox and the completion of the Chelsea Pensionerswere no every day objects to fasten an hungry eyeupon. Unless I am much deceived, I was indirectlyinstrumental to the fixing of the price upon thislatter, most felicitous and bewitching effort of hisunrivalled pencil.It was during the progress of working at my attentively,turned round to me, and telling me he was perfectly well acquaintedwith the spot, added "En effet, monsieur, Jay suis." Then,again, his Italian Sea-Ports Can one vouchsafe a glance upon VERNETafterwards ? Yes ; but for thirteen seconds only.Mr. Wilkie lived comparatively within a stone's-throw of me.

The Chelsea Pensionersthe perfection of THE, as well as of his, art the Sketch ofJohn Knox preaching : and I think of several others. The highestcompliment ever paid to a Royal Academician, was paid to Mr. Wilkieon the exhibition of his Chelsea Pensioners. I was present on the firstday ; the pressure to see it was prodigious ; and the picture being placedon a level with the eye, every body chose to exercise the nose too. Meanwhile,rims of bonnets were rubbed upon the surface of the painting, whichwas soon likely to be killed with over-much caressing. I acquaintedMr. Wilkie with this circumstance, and the mischief likely to ensue ;and the next day saw the picture guarded by a semicircular brass-fence.I reviewed it, as well as the Parish Beadle, in the Museum. I oughtto add, that I saw his Duke of Fork and Distraining for Rent in theirprogress of execution. Mr. Wilkie's pictures are painted for all agesand all countries. The immense sale of the PRINTS, executed fromthem, is a triumphant confirmation of the latter.K.ENSINGTONIANA.cameron, that I received visits from two Artists ofvery different complexion and degrees of reputation :I mean NORTIICOTE and BLAKE.

Iused to meet Mr. Northcote frequently at dinner atthe late Bishop of Salisbury's, in Upper SeymourStreet, and was always well pleased at his courteousbehaviour and gentleness of expression. Few electricalsparks were ever elicited from him in conversation; but one liked to listen to the periods, shortor quaint as they might have been, of ONE who hadpainted so much, and done many things so well, asNORTHCOTE*.The establishment of the SHAKSPEARE GALLERY may be said tohave established Northcote's fame upon a more permanent basis than ithad yet rested. His " Smothering of the Young Princes t, Hubert andArthur, and more especially, Lady Jane Grey," are among the mostmasterly efforts of his pencil. Of these, my friend Mr. Neeld, memberfor rhippenham, possesses the latter, for which he gave 300 guineas. Itis full of pathos, or sympathy for suffering beauty and innocence ; forto talk of tjitilt in a child of seventeen is an insult upon the human understanding,and an outrage upon all law or principle, human and divine,t I remember, during the evening, after a dinner party at Mr. WatsonTaylor's, in Cavendish Square, being called by the host to notice theexact conformity of the figures of these two young princes asleep, withthe two celebrated young sleeping figures on the monument exhibited byi . Clan trey, some twenty years ago, which justly ran away with allthe applause of the room of sculpture at Somerset House.

In an instant he was inhis "third heaven" flapped by the wings ofseraphs, such as his own genius only could shape,and his own pencil embody. The immediate subjectof our discussion and for which indeed he professedto have in some measure visited me was,the minor poems of Milton."

Heaven,hell, and earth, and the depths below, are some of the scenes he seemsalike to have tenanted ; but the invisible world also busies his fancy ;aerial beings which could only float in his visions, and unimaginablechimeras, such as you have never viewed, lie by the side of his sunshinypeople.

The finish, the extreme delicacy of his pencil, in hislight gracile forms, marvellously contrast with the ideal figures of hismystic allegories ; sometimes playful, as the loveliness of the arabesquesof RafFaelle.

Not theleast extraordinary fact of these designs is, their colouring, done by theartist's own hand, worked to his fancy ; and the verses, which are oftenremarkable for their sweetness and their depth of feeling.

Among these, I was sometimesfavoured with a call from Sir Harry Englefield,who once breakfasted with Mr, Kett at my house.The latter was at that time considered as an Exilefrom Oxford. I have before made mention of him,and through him I was indebted for my introductionto the venerable and learned President of MagdalenCollege*. In these Spencerian labours, whileoccupied with the editions of Juvenal, I had recourseto a copy of Gering*s edition as supposed to bethefirst which was in the library of MagdalenCollege, in order to make my description complete :a copy of that identical impression being then onits way from the Continent to Lord Spencer. Itwas a pity not to lose such an opportunity of completingthe description. Moreover, the volume wasessential to me for the purpose of making the facsimilewhich appears in the work, vol. ii. p. 21,From the President I received the following graciouscommunication :Magdalen College, Oxford, Feb. 9, 1813.DEAR SIR,4 As I should too probably have omitted some curiousSeepage 115.KENSINGTON1ANA. 791particulars in my description of the Gearing's Juvenal, I determined,alter consulting the officers of the College, to entrustthe book itself to the care of Mr. Kett, who went totown this morning.

THOMAS RENNELL as hissuccessor. The presentation to the living lay withthe Bishop of London, now Archbishop of Canterbury; and I do not believe that any one exercise ofthat Prelate's episcopal rights ever gave greatersatisfaction, or was attended with more beneficialresults, than the appointment under consideration.A love of truth, however, compels me to declare thatI was a competitor for the important object at stake.I had lived upwards of a dozen years in the Town,had a large general acquaintance, many friends, andfelt assured that my energies would be readily andvigorously devoted to a conscientious discharge ofall the important duties which such a stationKENSINOTONIANA. 793enjoined. Lord Spencer was so obliging as to promotemy views, by personally waiting upon LordLiverpool and the Bishop. The written reply ofthe latter to my Patron was quite characteristic ofthe elegant mind, and honest motives, in forming adecision adverse to my wishes. That prelate atfirst offered the living (which then netted about1000/. per annum, with a roomy house and largegrounds, and which had been enlightened andadorned by the presence of Fortin), to his oldfriends Dr. Goddard and Mr. Archdeacon Wollaston.On their declining it, it was presented to the eldestson of Dr. Kennel, Dean of Winchester!.Mr. Kennel was a young man, but with an oldhead upon young shoulders. He was an excellentscholar, a practised writer, and what is better thanboth together, a good Christian. He entered uponthe important duties of his office (which, alas ! hewas to fill for so short a period) with zeal, withOld Mr. Martin, the bookbinder, who did business for Dr. Fortin,told me, that Dr. Fortin had told him, " he never made 400/. per ann. ofKensington vicarage."

This ought not to betShortly after the appointment of his son to the vicarage, I met theDean of Winchester, as my " frequent wont" was to meet him, in theshop of Mr. Payne, the bookseller, with whom he much loved (as whodid not ?) to hold " pleasant discourse." The Dean had bandagesabout his legs, being then under the treatment of Dr. Scott. He couldnot easily rise from his seat to greet me exclaiming, that " he was notaHIRING man !"

He DID so uniformly andeminently ; and on the expiration of the first sevenyears, or, as he would term it, his "service ofapprenticeship" his parishioners gave him a publicdinner in attestation of his worth and public services.His church was always filled hy an attentive andwell-ordered congregation. His manner of preachingwas his own, and therefore the more relished by hisauditory. All that has been before said of earnestness*at once the characteristic and charm ofKennel's addresses from his pulpit must be repeatedhere. The preacher was naturally a man of greatacuteness of understanding. He loved to trip upfallacies by the heels, and to dissect sophisms totheir very bare bone. He was singularly happy inone memorable instance of the display of thisanatomise talent. His scholarship was soundand varied.Page 173, &c.t I remember consulting Mr. Kennel upon a passage of GregoryNazianzen, connected with an excerpt from that Father, by Melanchthon,as written in the fly-leaf of one of his books ; noticed in the LibraryCompanion, page 16, first edition. The passage is a little crabbed orobscure ; but it served as a spur to the Vicar's researches, for he wroteme the following critical and pleasant letter upon the subject :MY DEAR SIB, " Vicarage, Thursday Evening.The passage which you mentioned to me this morning, occurs inthe thirty-first oration of Greg.

' Allmen cannot receive this saying , save they to whom it is given;' uponwhich he thus comments :' When you hear this expression, ' it is given,' do not suffer yourselfto be led into heresy, nor speculate upon the difference of mens'natures, the earthy, the spiritual, or those between both. For there arethose who are so ill disposed, as to think that some men are of a naturefitted altogether for destruction, and others for salvation ; and that theseare severally in such a condition, according as their predisposition shallincline them to the worse or to the better. I myself, indeed, allow thatone man will have a greater or a less aptitude than another ; but I donot allow that this aptitude alone is sufficient for perfection, but thatthere is a process of reasoning which calls it out, that nature may advanceto the accomplishment of the work as the stone produces fire,when struck with the iron. Ashen you hear this expression, ' to whomit is given,' add this, ' it is given to those who are called, and who havethus a right inclinationThe whole passage is rather crabbed, as Gregory is steering the truecourse between predestination on the one side, and unassisted liberty onthe other. I have given you a tolerably close translation, which mayperhaps explain the meaning of the passage in question. Melanchthonprobably cited it in opposition to the violent predestinarianism of Calvin,at the same time ascribing to the grace of God its due effect upon thehuman will.I have to thank you for putting me upon this scent ; as in the courseof the evening I have read over one splendid oration, in which I wasdisappointed of the passage, but was delighted even with my disappointment.My second trial was a more lucky one, for I found it immediately.I shall be happy to show you the passage, or to send youthe volume.Always, my dear sir,Very truly yours,Til.

Doubtless, had helived, he would have done a great deal more in thisway; and become thereby such an ornament to hisprofession, as to have secured for him a seat uponthe bench of Bishops.Ille si quis alms !

He had married the daughter of myneighbour Mr. Delafield, in the preceding autumn ;and during his absence I helped to fill his place inthe pulpit. On his return, he exhibited serioussymptoms of indisposition ; but he was watched,and nursed, and attended by domestic solicitude andmedical skill. I will own that I saw him, the firsttime on his return, with serious apprehensions. Adiagnostic physician might even then have auguredfatally of consequences. The last note in reply toone containing an anxious inquiry, on my part, aboutKENSINOTONIANA. 797his hrnlth, with an offer of professional help whichI ever received from him, was the following :Vicarage, Monday.MY DEAR Sir,Let me thank you most truly for your valuableoffer. Hope, from day to day, will promise me that tomorrowI shall be able to take my duties in part again.But I almost fear the worst. It would be wise therefore toclose in with your gratifying offer. My complaint is Iknow not what ; it is, I fear, a very long insidious derangementof digestive organs. It makes me utterly useless bothto myself and others. I could not have seen you to-day atthe time you called. Perhaps you will be kind enough tomorrow,or the next day, to try me again, and I will promiseyou a better reception. Many thanks to you for thevery kind interest which you take in me.Most faithfully yours,To the best of my recollection I never saw himafterwards. Meanwhile the utmost solicitude wasexpressed by his patron, as well as by his parishioners,respecting the progress of his indisposition. I hadcommunicated occasionally with the Bishop. " Iam much obliged (said his Lordship in one of hisnotes) by your kindness in writing. Would to Godyour intelligence were not of so melancholy a kind !I shall be grieved to the heart should anythinghappen to Mr. Kennel." It was thought advisable798 KENSINGTONIANA.to send him to his Father, at Winchester, for thepresumed benefit from change of air; and the Vicartook leave (alas, a final one!) of Kensington, withthe best wishes, and many sighs, of the Inhabitantsfor his convalescent return. He sunk gradually,but certainly. It was one direct unvarying courseof increasing debility and prostration. But themind had yet its " heavenly musings." Nothingdaunted the hopes of the sufferer, or repressed hisfeeding upon his Redeemer, in his heart, by faith,with thanksgiving." The intelligence of his deathfirst reached me (when I had been four monthssettled in Town) from the Archbishop, or rather histhen Diocesan.

I owed this almostentirely to the friendly intervention of the late Mr.Hebe for upon that illustrious Senator himself Ihad not the shadow of a claim. We only came incontact when I was placed in the pulpit of KensingtonChurch. What was suffered on partingwith that Son from his native land, could only beexceeded in agony, by the intelligence, some sevenyears afterwards, of having parted with him forever! But this is premature uppermost as it is,and never can fail to be, in the mind and upon theheart of a Parent.

I hadshot a good way beyond my fortieth year, when prefermentcame upon me and in a manner almostdouble-handed.My first piece of preferment, in 1823, after havingbeen nineteen years in the church, was the smallSee page 168, ante.LONDON.living of Exiling, in Suffolk, situate within t\\<>miles of Newmarket*. For this first move I wasexclusively indebted to my late Noble Patron whonever ceased, since the completion of the Bibl. $pen (mariana, to regret the absence of all previous opportunityof befriending me in my profession. I wasgrateful for the autumnal retreat which this slender,but in many respects comfortable, residence affordedme.

Four additional Churches werein due course erected ; to the first of which St.Mar\fS) Brimstone Square I was presented bythe Earl of Liverpool, then Premier.There were some unusual circumstances attending,or rather preceding, this presentation. Thepoint at issue was altogether unprecedented : and ahost of candidates was in the field for the possessionof the prize. I was one in the number which it issaid (I know not even with what semblance of truth)amounted to one hundred and thirty. But the hopesand anxieties of each candidate were kept in abeyancefor nearly three years. Two years had elapsedbetween the putting in of my own " lot in the urn"and its turning up a prize.

It is impossible tolook back upon this gilded moment without feelingthe consciousness of the value of those " golden opinions"than which nothing could be more delightfulfor myself to receive, and without which I considergood luck to be worthless, and the wealth of millionsbut as rubbish. I will particularise no one ofthese " congratulatory strains" in preference to anotherbut I yet possess them ALL . and considering<r what has since taken place, and that the authorsof several have quitted this world for a better . Iam not sure whether, in the perusal of them, sorrowdo not preponderate over pleasure? From almostall quarters all callings and pursuits in life, Iwas fortunate enough to receive some one little flower ;so as to make, of the whole, a nosegay of rather animposing size, and of a decidedly "sweet odour."Sic positi (jiioniani suaves iniMvtis adores!"806 LONDON.But what fixed my foot more firmly upon thefresh soil which I was treading, was, that I startedwith my old and faithful friend Sir Francis Freelingfor my Church Warden ; and I believe for the wholeapprenticeship-period of seven years, for which hewas invested with that office, he never shrunk fromthe fulfilment of the duties of it in every essentialparticular. These duties were, to be sure, slender,and of rare occurrence ; but they had still demandsupon time like his, so overwhelmingly engrossed bythe more important duties of his public station.The church of St. Mary's, Marylebone, wasconsecrated on the 7th of January, 1824. I preachedthe sermon on that occasion ; and as this sermon isbefore the public in print, it shall tell its own tale.But there was one understanding in the congregationto which it savoured somewhat of heresy :for an anonymous letter was written to the Bishop(now Archbishop of Canterbury) complaining ofwhat I chuse here to designate as a lack of spiritualityand unctuousness of the sermon in question.The Bishop, with that discretion and gentlemanlyfeeling which always characterise him, sent me theanonymous letter as his usual proceeding was insuch matters without one word of commentary. I feltit a duty to make a particular reply to my Diocesan ;but I could only harbour contempt for my shadowycorrespondent even had I known the substance towhich he were attached. There is nothing sothoroughly base and indefensible as anonymous vi-london.807operation. But the spirit which dictated this pieceof flimsy criticism, vented itself, in the course of theyear, in the newspapers, by gentle insinuations andgratuitous inferences, that my pursuits were of tooliterary a complexion to enable me to attend to themany professional duties of my newly appointedsituation.O, quam saepe mails generator orig bonorum!"So sings Lucilius ; as may be seen in Wernsdorf 'sedition of the minor Latin Poets, Altenb. 1788, 8vo.p. 163. My " gentle " Censures was indirectly andunintentionally the cause of much good to me. Icalled the attention of the Bishop to these publicnotices ; simply from an excess of sensibility, lestthey might, by the remotest operation, warp hiskindly-disposed feeling towards me. His answer atonce justified the step taken by me, and entrenchedme, as it should seem, yet more strongly in his favourableopinion. Above all, did it confirm me inthe views I had ever taken of the compatibility oflife ran with professional occupations. After assuringme that " I had no reason to fear that anyimpression to my disadvantage would be made uponhim by statements in the newspapers, which weretoo apt to take liberties with public characters," hisLordship was pleased to express himself thus : " Amind, active like yours, will find leisure sufficientfor literary pursuits after the faithful discharge ofmure important duties; and will perhaps <Krm608 LONDON.vigour from this change of employment to givegreater efficacy to its daily labours." Fortified bysuch a dictum from such a quarter, I resolved, inthe union of such avocations, to shrink from no exertionswhich the duties of my church and the caresof my family might equally call upon and countenanceme in the performance.An occasion quickly presented itself for the exerciseof the double duty both of Author and Pastor.A National School was, not long after the openingof St. Mary's, established in the immediate vicinityof the Church. Its history is unprecedented. Thesplendid liberality of ONE Individual of the nameof Willard * enabled us to erect a building whichThere is almost something of the air of romance attached to thetf splendid liberality" of the late JAMES Willard, Esq. who died a bachelor,or a widower (I forget which), without children, some six or sevenyears ago.

He also presented the fundsof the above National School with 4000/. precisely on the same terms :and he did not survive the donation six years ! Here was a special anda glorious display of CHRISTIAN BENEVOLENCE in the best of all causes!And yet, will the reader believe it ? can he believe it ?

In each I have done my best ; butit was a proud moment for me, when, in the language of one of mysubscribers to the reprint of Fox 8 Martyrology, I read such a sentimentas the following : " for my principles, in the religion of my country,I refer you to those developed in your own most acceptable volumeof Sermons."

I will endeavour to be methodical. Inthe spring of 1826, I issued proposals for the publicationof THOMAS A KEMPIS, " On the Imitationof Christ." In the spring of the ensuing year, Iannounced an intention of bringing out a newedition of Fox's BOOK OF MARTYRS. Of each ofthese in due order. But I was now to be revisited *with a severe and overwhelming sorrow. The readermay remember t that my elder and only survivingSon had been presented by Mr. Canning with a to Bengal. He had been seasoned,as most young men usually are, by a sharp fit ofillness on his arrival in India; and was meditatingan embarkation as far as the Cape for the establishmentof his health. Calcutta appearing to agreewith him, the Marquis of Hastings, then Governor-general,and Commander-in-chief, very kindly andopportunely gave him an appointment in his BodyGuard. He fulfilled the duties of that station regularlyand honourably for a twelvemonth ; and findinghis health established, he rejoined his regiment upthe Country ; where he was both respected andcaressed by his brother Officers. The letters whichI continued to receive from him were of the mostgratifying description ; evincing the gallant feelingan aspiring young man not less observant of steadydiscipline than of gentlemanly decorum. Yet, asSee page 283. t See page 800, ante.LONDON. 817is ever the case, a secret love of home an increasingattachment to parents and sisters, as distance increasedwould frequently be the under current ofhis effusions. The siege of Buhrtpoor came, andhe was regularly at his victorious post as SeniorLieutenant of his regimentAlas! at length came the hour of dismay andaffliction to his Parents. In the spring of 1827 1went down to join my family at Exning for a week'scalm and comfort ; the intermitting and importantduties of my situation rendering such a temporaryretreat almost indispensable. On leaving Town, Istrictly forbade the transmission of all letters uponbusiness or otherwise ; for, as if " prescient ofcoming ill," I observed, that " I would not have onedrop of bitter infused into that week's cup of sweets."My instructions were literally fulfilled in this quarter.Not one letter was sent from home to Exning. Butfrom another quarter, the Post brought two letterson the same morning, each sealed with black wax,and written in the same hand. I had as usual beenabroad before the Post arrived ; and looking from mygarden gate, saw a grave being dug in the churchyardnot having been apprised of the death ofany Parishioner. I had no sooner learnt the nameof the deceased, than the letters were put into myhand. The issue needs no lengthened recital. Thesympathetic reader will anticipate the failings ofwoe and wretchedness, and the desolation of heartSo818 LONDON.which ensued ! It came upon us all like a thunderbolt; but one spirit has been since gradually sinking,and longing to be at rest with HIM who hasbeen thus prematurely taken from her !My own individual sorrow was as deep as unfeigned.When the effects of the stunning blowhad a little subsided, on looking out, as it were,upon the external face of things, how drearyappeared every object upon which the eye alighted !The heavens were never smiling ; the sky was neverbright and beautiful ; and the buds and blossoms ofSpring seemed to taunt man on the sterility of thegrave ! These were early, and perhaps naturalemotions; but the "sorrow" which is "withouthope," is not the sorrow of a Christian and itwas neither mine nor that of my family. Thencame from every sympathising quarter those lettersof condolence like heaven's own dew-drops to refreshthe parched ground ! The effect of them fell uponour hearts, and sunk as deeply as they were plentifullybestowed. My son's patron, Mr. Canning,led the way on this mournful occasion : " sincerelycondoling with me on my irreparable misfortune."It was the last note (March 27, 1827) which I everreceived from him ; and he too, within six monthsof that day, was to be added to the DEPARTED.

I deeply regret that I do not considermyself at liberty to make it public. Frommy Diocesan I received a letter full of sentimentsand expressions which did honour to human nature,and to any rank however exalted. I will ventureupon his forgiveness as I am sure I shall obtainthe commendation of the reader if that letter heremeet the public eye. Alas I since its scription,how yet more deeply has its Author partaken of thecup of domestic affliction * !London, April 13, 1827."MY DEAR SIR,I heard with great concern of your domestic calamity ;and having children myself, know full well what must be theaffliction of parents for the loss of a beloved Son. I couldnot, at such a moment, expect that your mind would be atliberty to think of literary engagements however importantand was not surprised at your silence.

LONDON."And with what exquisite and to him naturalfeeling, did my affectionate friend Sir F. Freeling,address himself to one of my family upon the occasion." I am laid low (observed he in a letter tomy elder daughter) by the account of this afflictingvisitation of Providence. I cannot write to yourgood Father upon it, for my heart is sunk withinme. I pray to God to support him and your excellentMother under this trying dispensation," &c. &c,His letter to myself, subsequently written after Ihad poured forth the sorrows of my heart into hisbosom is fraught with such exquisite touches offeeling, as well as sound and consolatory advice asplaces its author among the justest thinkers, as wellas most felicitous Epistolographers, of the day. Thecore of my heart is not dearer to me than is thisletter. Nor was my old friend Mr. Douce muchless prompt and warm in his sorrowing sympathies.Be assured (observed he) that you have not a connexionthat more sincerely and deeply deplores theloss you have sustained. My nerves are not equalto bear even the affliction of others ; and I am freeto state, that I always thought visits of condolenceLONDON. 821the most unnecessary things in the world and I ampersuaded that not one person in ten expresses hisreal feelings on the occasion. Moreover, I havenot been well for some time, and am unable to takelong walks as I used to do ; even to call on our poorfriend Wilbraham*, whose looks and appearance,yesterday, when he called, distressed me not a little."But from a " Centenary " of Letters on this heart-distressingsubject, it will be difficult, as it might bedelicate, to continue the selection. My old andamiable friends, whose names are not specificallymentioned, will not, I feel persuaded, do me the injusticeto think that I value their communicationsthe less on that account t.

Itsvery tone of asceticism was medicine to a bruisedspirit : for at that moment I could have become acloistered monk even of the order of St. Francis, orof St. Dominic. But I had scarcely begun to make adecided progress in my Kemplsian labours, when Ireceived the startling intelligence of the serious illness,and, in all probability, approaching dissolutionof Mr. CANNING. He had been my son's principalbenefactor ; and ever since the perusal of his Iterad Mecca I had been induced to consider himas among the most elegant Latin poets of the day.His victorious eloquence in the senate needed notthe humble testimony of my praise.

There was no hope ; and on' the 8thof August, 1827, he breathed his last, as PrimeMinister of Great Britain.I pretend not to know, and of course I am incapableof appreciating, what collateral causes mighthave hastened his departure : but the mind of thePremier was not composed of ordinary materials.

I believe neither the onenor the other. But the sorrow of the country wasgeneral and sincere on the death of the latter : andit is my firm belief, that had his life been prolonged,he would have been among the most skilful and distinguishedpilots who had ever weathered the vesselof state through all the conflicting and harrowingstorms which might have environed it. What aspeech would his have been, on bringing in thebill for his favourite measure, of emancipation of theRoman Catholics, under the conviction that it wouldI allude to his duel with Lord Londonderry ; while Sir FrancisBurnett is a living instance that Mr. Canning was never deficient in theexaction of what he conceived to be due to himself as a gentleman. 1 1 sohappened that I was the very first of the Kensingtonians to call at(Gloucester Lodge within twenty minutes after its owner had beenbrought in wounded in the thigh from the bullet of his adversary.826 LONDON*be triumphantly carried through both Houses. Yetthe speech of Sir Robert Peel, on the same occasion,would have owned no superior but that of his predecessor*.The funeral of Mr. Canning, which I had requestedto attend, was strictly private. My communicationon the subject was through Mr. Backhouse,one of the Secretaries of the Foreign Office ;a gentleman, who was the intimate and confidentialfriend of Mr. Canning, and who adorns the importantsituation which he fills as well by the integrityof his principles as by the suavity of his manners :whose heart is as warm as his head is clear. " Ilost no time (said Mr. Backhouse, in his reply tomy request) in transmitting your note of yesterdayto the Duke of Portland. Such testimonies of re-My own mind needed not the aid of either speech to convince meof the wisdom of the proposed measure. Lord Grenville, some twentyyears preceding, in the Upper House, had wrought upon me the mostcomplete conviction of the indispensable necessity of the adoption ofthat bill. His reasoning not less convinced than his eloquence warmedme. The history of the late career of this bill, through both Houses, isamong the most curious, as well as astounding, upon record. Meetingthe present Bishop of Exeter before he was advanced to the bench, andshortly after we had been both voting at Oxford for Sir Robert Peel(who abandoned his seat on bringing it in), he told me he had beenpresent at Sir Robert's delivery of his Speech. It lasted four hours. Onmy asking him how he liked it, he said, " he had never been so delightedsince the time of Pitt. It did not appear to him to have lasted half thetime; he never tired one moment." But the more curious thing tomention is, that Sir Robert Peel, before he slipped on his night-capthat evening, or rather morning, saw his whole speech in the printedcolumns of a daily journal. This has been unhesitatingly told me froma quarter in which I put the highest faith.LONDON. 827spect and attachment cannot fail to be grateful tothe feelings of the afflicted family and friends ofMr. Canning. I understand that the direct invitationsto the funeral will he confined strictly to theimmediate connexions of the DEAR DEPARTED, andto the Cabinet Ministers ; and that the friends generally,who may intimate a wish, like yours, will berequested to meet at a suitable place (to be appointed)in the immediate neighbourhood of theAbbey, then to join the procession. It is probablethat a public notice to this effect may be issued tomorrow.I am," &c.For some reason, of a peremptory and professionalnature, I was unable to attend ; but I gave vent insome measure to my sympathetic feelings, and to myadmiration of the talents of the deceased, in the sermonpreached in the pulpit of St. Mary's on the Sundayfollowing the funeral of which the text was this :2 Kings, xx. v. 1., " Set thine house in order ; forthou shall die, and not live." Among my auditorsit was gratifying to see the countenance, and toconfide in the sympathy, of Mr. Backhouse and hisLady. But I hasten to lay before the reader somethingof much more interest and importance, connectedwith the ILLUSTRIOUS DEAD, than the feebletestimony here recorded. On examining the immensecorrespondence of the late Mr. Hebe (theonce intimate friend of Mr. Canning, and to whoseintervention I was primarily indebted for im <on'<cadetship from the latter) I found an original note828 LONDON.from the late Lady Hester Lucy Stanhope* (a cousinof Mr. Pitt) to Mr. Hebe; written, as it bears toopalpable evidence, a short time before Mr. Pitt'sdecease ; and containing the following proud testimony,from the dying statesman, of the affectionatemanner in which he estimated the moral worth ofMr. Canning,Montague Square, Thursday Night.DEAR SIR,Finding that I must send early tomorrow to my friendTownshend (your neighbour) I have put off conveying theintelligence I promised you to-day by the penny post.

He arrived at Putney the evening ofthat day, accompanied by Charles and Sir Walter thoughnothing hurts me, and enrages me so much, as personsclaiming Mr. P.'s friendship who neither possessed nordeserved it. I am more than anxious that THOSE whom hereally loved, should be known by the world to have enjoyedso great a happiness ; as it ought to make them stand highin the estimation of every honest man. Might it not thereforebe as well to particularly mention the affectionatemanner in which he received Lord Wellesley on his returnfrom India (the Tuesday he saw Lord Chatham), and toadd, that the Marquis was one of his oldest and dearestfriends, as this is really the fact for whenever I complainedabout the "fools" he used to say, " Have patience, Wellesleyis coming home in him you will have all the talentThere can be no doubt of its genuineness.

Thepoor secluded monk, who had scarcely a glimmer oflight in his cell, becomes irradiated in the estimationof posterity with a sort of halo of undyingglory. So fared it with the Author of THEIMITATION.Under every view of the subject, I was determinedto make it both a beautiful book and acritical performance ; and I will venture to indulgethe rational hope that my wishes have been realisedin both particulars. I know not a more beaut ii'uloctavo volume on the score of printing and embellishment,and I am willing to believe that it has receiveda competent portion of editorial aid *. The Countallude more especially to the INTRODUCTION, which embracesthree points of view: 1. Of the author of the work. 2. Editions ofthe work. 3. Character of the work. The third division is one onwhich I look back with the greater satisfaction, as touching on moreimportant and stirring objects. It concludes thus : " If, occasionally,there be MYSTICISM, it is the mysticism of a spirit not intoxicated byconceit, rashness, and misguided zeal. It is quietism (with few exceptions)of the purest nature ; a casting down of the eyes; a smiting of thebreast ; an invocation to heaven, to have mercy upon a sinful soul. Inall highly wrought and fitful moods and especially in those appertainingto religious studies some little indiscretions, whether of judgmentor of conduct, will be readily pardoned by a charitable Christian.That the author of this work is free from such venial errors, nevercame within the contemplation of his present editor. It is from a convictionof the good, theoretical and practical, which these pages contain,that the author of them now appears, in a garb not unworthy, 1trust, of his reputation, to attract the notice, and to secure the respect,of the virtuous reader. Nor can I close this painful travail' I*than by availing myself of the concluding remarks of my immediatepredecessor, DR. CHALMERS.'

" p. d.The reader may probably be well disposed to receive a brief specimenof the tone and character of the original text. " JESUS hath many loversof his heavenly kingdom, but few bearers of his cross. He hath manythat desire to partake of his comforts, but few to share in his distress.He finds many companions of his repast, but few of his abstinence. Allare disposed to rejoice with Jesus, but few to suffer sorrow for his sake.Many follows him even to the breaking of bread, but few of the drinkingof the bitter cup. Many reverence his miracles, but few follow the ignominyof the cross. Many love Jesus while they are free from adversity;many praise and bless Him while they receive his consolations;but if Jesus hide his face, and leave them but a little, their confidenceis shaken, and they sink into murmur and despair." * ******This desire of suffering is not the effect of any power inherent in man,but is the fruit of the GRACE of CHRIST ; operating so powerfully in thefrail flesh as to make it love and embrace that which it would naturallyabhor and shun. It is not in man to love and bear the cross ; to resistthe appetites of the body, and bring them under subjection to the spirit ;to shun honors ; to receive affronts with meekness ; to despise himself,and to wish to be despised by others ; to bear with resignation the lossof fortune, health, and friends, and to have no desire after the prosperityof this world. If thou dependent upon thyself, thou wilt findthat thou canst do nothing of the kind ; but if thou trusted in GOD,strength shall be given to thee from on high, and the world and theflesh shall be put under thy feet.

His Grace's views uponthe entire bearing of the original, appeared to meto be as luminous as just. He desired nothing morethan that error might be guarded against, and truth,if possible, still more firmly established. I hadpreviously and deliberately weighed (in my ownmind) the pro and con of the whole undertaking.I did not shrink from its magnitude, and (to speakthe truth from my inmost bosom) I was determinednot to set about the task as & partisan on either sideof the question. My own opinion of Fox had beenslightly shadowed, rather than positively expressed,in the pages of the Bibliomania ; and if thatauthor had many errors to rectify, and many extravagancesto qualify, still, in the main, there appearedto be a strong current of truth which pervaded hispages*. I had, moreover, for many years whichmy previous habits of study and research at onceprovoked and strengthened a strong desire towrite a History of the Reformation, either by anew edition of Burnet, or on an expressly newscale ; and having, by choosing Fox, necessarilyabandoned the former, I thought I could make theAbout a year and a half after the issuing of my prospectus, MR.SOUTHEY, not knowing in what state the work was, observed thus in aletter from Keswick " Is your edition of THE ACTS AND MONUMENTSgoing forward ?

And I had also a lurking suspicionthat Burnet had either examined his authoritiescarelessly, or had quoted them superficially;believing him, intentionally, to have been incapableof holding out false lights. Under all these impressions,I put forth my Prospectus and at oncechallenged and courted the freest strictures of myfriends*.Among the most cordial, as well as the most forward in the transmissionof these strictures, was my old and excellent friend, Mr. ArchdeaconTODD. " I wish much to talk with you (observed he) of JohnFox ; the life of him you must write anew. Many are the slumberingmaterials respecting him, and a very interesting piece of biography, Iam quite sure, you can make of him." Again, on the receipt of myprospectus: "Do not make needless concessions in your prospectus.As loud as you can cry, I will (much older though I be) shout louderfor the historian, and exclaim, ' Fox FOR EVER ! ' " On his first visitto me in London, on coming to take his turn of duty at the ChapelRoyal, as one of the King's Chaplains, I perfectly remember his gallanteffervescence of speech touching my Fox "when I had read yourprospectus (said he) methought I rose from my table a foot higher."The present venerable and learned Dean of Winchester (Dr. Kennel)was thus pleased to cheer me on the publication of the prospectus, andwith his entire approbation of the " end and aim" of the work itself.MY DEAR SIR, Deanery, Feb. 3, 18S7.I return you my best thanks for your kind communication of yourintention of giving a new edition of Fox's Martyrs.

To vindicateFox's veracity, as would be done in the course of your most laudableundertaking, would be to render an essential service to the chinEngland.

[Fox's BookI found in Mr. Pickering who was one of thepublishers of my Thomas & Kempis a bookseller,well disposed to push my work to the utmost possiblelimits, consistently with a consideration of prudence,and, I believe, little short of the sum of 100/. wasabsolutely expended by him in fulfilling theoffice of avant courier only. The mode of publicationwas announced in the following words ofthe Prospectus.To render the impression of such a work (which may be truly calledNATIONAL) as deserving as possible of public patronage, it is proposed toexecute it in the commodious form of an Octavo of which one volumewill be published every two months. Is is calculated that the entirework will not exceed TWELVE VOLUMES ; each volume containing 650pages. The text will be accompanied by short illustrative NOTES ; which,as these will occasionally contain the fruit of researches among MSS. andscarce publications, will, it is presumed, render the present the mostvaluable impression extant. This Impression will be also at least asattractive in ILLUSTRATION as any previous edition. It will containaccurate fac-similes of the spirited Wood Cuts, either entire, or in part,as the occasion may require; which are peculiar to the Black letterEditions, and which are so unskilfully and faithless executed uponCopper in that of 1684. Each volume will be further embellished withat least one Portrait, upon Wood, of the principal REFORMER whoselife, or works, are described in the volume published. These portraitswill be taken from original paintings whenever obtainable.

It is further proposed to commencethis Edition with the " HISTORY OP WICLIPPE," as being moreimmediately interesting to English Readers ; and to give all the introductoryportion of Fox (which is composed in a more general and excursivemanner) by way of SUPPLEMENT.The appeal was unsuccessful. It was impossibleto think of going to press without seven hundredand fifty copies bespoke. The amount of Subscriberswas scarcely one third of that number.The names of four Bishops only (London, Durham,Salisbury, and Chester, now London) appeared inthe list of Subscribers. My own personal friendswere all, as before, at their posts, and the majorityof them for large paper copies. But it was a palpablefailure ; and after many days and many nights ofactive research, and harassing anxiety, I consoledmyself with the reflection of having merited* if II might have added, that the first edition of the original work,published in 1563 (see too Bibliomania, p. 315-6, and Typographical Antiquities,vol. iv. p. 82), was of excessive rarity, as well as great value.I believe that the only known perfect copies of this first edition are inthe libraries of the Rt. Hon. Thomas Grenville and T. \\ wilkes, Esq.,M. P. The latter had belonged to the late Mr. Hurd, and was purchasedat the sale of his library for 257. No doubt, the greater numberof copies, once fastened to desks in parish churches, had been torn awayby piecemeal. A little instructive volume, purely bibliographical, i;be written upon all the editions of Fox's Martyrs.844 LONDON.had not obtained, the reward which, from the beginning,I had been sanguine enough to anticipate.This was very natural. But whatever were the disappointmentsconsequent upon the failure of thissplendid project, they were born with evenness, yea,with the heroic coolness of a Martyr comparedwith the endurance of that vexation and dismaywhich, in the subsequent year, overtook me fromthe failure of a scheme of a wholly moral, or as itmay be called social, character and tendency.The caprice of the public is not only to bemet, but to be endured, by every man who makesthat public a tribunal to which he appeals. Thereare, however, circumstances connected with ourpublic characters, more difficult in the treatment,and more mischievous in their results. Fraud,cunning, falsehood, hypocrisy, recklessness, andwhen they play about us in ever-shifting Proteus-shapes,are terrible things to combat with. I hadlistened to " the voice of a Charmer," in the avowedobject of parochial, as well as Chris manlike benevolence.I was circumvented by the wiles of morethan One, to lend my countenance, as Rector, to theestablishment of an HOSPITAL in one of the mostpopulous and needful parts of my Parish. I wasto appoint a Chaplain, visit the sick wards, andpreach a Sermon for the benefit of the Institution.I acquiesced readily in all these plans for the alleviation,if not removal, of human suffering. Aboard was established. Beds were procured, andLONDON. 845patients began to increase. A subscription, chieflythrough my instrumentality*, was set on foot, andmany kind-hearted parishioners liberally contributed.But a dark and fearful cloud suddenly settled withinthe walls of the establishment. The prime moverof all this apparent public good, was only secretlystriving to accomplish some crooked and selfishplan of his own. He was a man as destitute ofresources as of principle.Suspicion and alarm now became the order ofthe day. A union of some active and highly honorablemen in the parish of Marylebone thoughtit essential to put forth a declaration by way ofcaution to the unwary, and of raising a warningvoice to the public, describing the character of thisPrime Mover" precisely in the terms which a loveof truth seemed to render it necessary it should be described.This declaration was subscribed by severalsubstantial householders ; and afterwards printedand circulated. It was owing to the manly and independentspirit of ONE Individual, in particular, that sowholesome a manifesto saw the light. As Rector ofthe District in which the pseudo Hospital was established,my name was necessarily at the head of theAmong these subscribers, my friend, Mr. Neeld (see page 785,ante), was considerate and kind-hearted enough (although not a parishioner),to give me a 10/. cheque.

There were the names of three respectableClergymen in addition.With a drowning man, it is but natural to catchat straws. But in this instance, the individual whowas the prime mover of all this complicated mischiefand misery, thought he had something more substantialthan straws to lay hold of; and, fortifiedeither by the shallow or insidious advice of someprofessional man, he brought an action of libelagainst the whole subscribing party ; fastening, inthe first instance, upon my friend, above alluded to,who had called us together to put a stop to suchiniquity. I was marked out as the second victim tothe infringement of law ; and damages were laid atSOOO/. in the first case, and at 7000/. in the second.Of course, it was firmly as well as finally determined,by every subscriber, to bear the expenses ofthe lawsuit in common. As the law of LIBEL itselfis perhaps one of the most mongrel and inexplicablefeatures of the jurisprudence of this country, so is theprocess of justification, by proof, specially pleaded,one of the most slippery and expensive. A verylong time, and consequent delay, was incurred inpreparing the defence ; while the plaintiff was asconfident as impatient for the day of trial. Some ofthe first characters in the realm were subpoenaed byour adversary to give the " air important " to his case.Lord Tenterden sat upon the bench. The wholeday was consumed in the trial. Had the plaintiffLONDON. 847succeeded, we had been all tumbled down like apack of cards. Lord Anger was leading counselfor my friend; and Lord Penman (supported byMr. Baron Gurney) were my own counsel. Thejury was a special one : but they did not deem itnecessary to give the Chief Justice the trouble ofsumming up. From the very opening of the case toits conclusion there could be but one colouringgiven to the whole. The plaintiff's ground hadbeen always rotten beneath his feet : and in hisheart he must have anticipated the "nonsuit"which was recorded against him. In the court oflaw our victory was complete ; but one has read ofvictories being tantamount to defeat. I reared mycrest in the Court of King's Bench ; but an expenseof 1200/. had been incurred and the plaintiff hadnot one twelve hundredth part of assets to meet it.In carrying the law into execution against one whohad so richly merited its severest visitation, we musthave incurred even an additional expense of Go.and of what use, of what solace, was the detentionof the person without the prospect of one shillingof remuneration for the incurred expense ? All thisis very incomprehensible, very shocking, and veryunjust. But it is the law of the land.Now came the pinching moment of a severer trial.My highly respected friend, who had " led us gallantlyinto action," stood, with myself, who immediatelyfollowed in his wake, " true to our guns."It remained to be seen who of our supporters stood848 LONDON.also true to theirs. The Rev. Basil Wood (a namenever to be pronounced but with all the Christiansympathies and charities playing about one's heart)and the Rev. Dr. Fawssett, had departed this lifebefore the day of settlement arrived. The widowof the former paid the required quota to the uttermostfarthing : and that of the latter manifested anamiable and generous feeling : but " WHERE WERETHE NINE?" Those among them who have heartsmust answer this question. All that remains to betold is, that this defence of character took five hundredpounds sterling out of each of the pockets ofmy friend and myself. These are sad incidents tonarrate, and sadder yet to reflect upon. There issurely no one object, moving about in society, morehorrible to mix up with, than that of a humanbeing, privileged, as he may now suppose himselfto be, to act the treble part of hypocrite, bully, andcoward.The effect of all this, upon a mind of sterner temperamentthan my own, might have been as harrowingand as distressing as, in fact, it was for a time,upon mine. It sickened me of all strange facesand especially of those which came whisking up tothe door in green carriages, with snorting horses IOh, what a quantity of cunning, fraud, and wickedness,do these " whisking carriages," in and aboutLondon, frequently enclose!

Of all the undertakingscontemplated, at ever so respectful a distance,none appeared to me to be so large, so bold, and yetso certainly productive of a profitable and honourableissue, as that which, towards the autumn of1829, I contemplated in reference to my belovedAlma Mater Oxoniensis. In short, it was nothingless than a History of that University, in three foliovolumes. The plan of it was carefully drawn up,and printed in a folio form, with a handsome type,by my friend Mr. Nicol, the proprietor of the Shakspearepress ; and I am not sure whether an expenseof some fourscore or a hundred pounds was not incurredin giving it publicity.

It seemed almost natural to requestthe opinion or advice of THE PRIMATE, as to theprobable result, supposing the materials of the workto be sound and valuable.

TheBishop, however, readily conceded to my request toallow me to print four sermons of his own, withthe permission of the Publishers which was readilygranted. I also consulted a common friend of theBishop's and myself, the Rev. A. M.

Ifthere be one object more than another, which he has at heart, in thepreparation of the materials of these ' Classics it is, that they may beinstrumental to the direction and consolidation of those Principles,upon which the present and future happiness of human beings may besaid to depend : as an antidote to the poison of infidelity on the onehand, and to the misery of fanaticism on the other. And if there beone Class of Individuals more likely to be benefited than another bysuch a Publication, it is The Young on commencing their career inlife whether at our Universities, or on being placed out in the world.If there be such attraction in the word ' Classics,' as applied to the cultivationof taste from a knowledge of Heathen Writers, let some of theablest treatises in our language (of which the titles are here announced)have their due influence upon the understandings of Young Men, whenthey are adorned by the purity of a classical style, and directed to thenoblest of earthly objects.CONTENTS.

This littlepamphlet of some forty pages was written in thespirit of a downright honest and fearless feeling;An anonymous correspondent, signing himself, " A PROTESTANT,"suggested to me, in a letter from Bath, dated May 12, 1835, a continuationof my " Sunday Library," by a selection of Sermons on theFeasts and Fasts of the Church, as likely to be of great advantage tothe public. His letter is at once flattering and grateful to me . . . but . . .it should seem, that the tide is ebbing, and a spring tide is yet far off.It was the wisest thing done in the management of the " SUNDAYLIBRARY," to stop where I did stop ; although I wanted not strongexhortations to double the number of volumes.to Its Flock'] LONDON. 875not in uniform commendation of the Bishop'sstrictures," nor certainly in anything approachingthe strain of panegyric of his Opponent's attacks.I look back upon this cordial impromptu with thatsatisfaction which every right-minded man shouldfeel on having performed his duty, in his own conscience,with justice to both parties.I hasten to colophonise. In the very beginning ofthe year of the appearance of the first volume ofthe " Sunday Library," 1831, EARL GREY becamePrime Minister of England, at the head of a WhigCabinet, and a Whig Government. Abroad, theFrench Revolution, which placed Louis Phillipsupon the throne of France, in the same year, wasone of the most extraordinary upon record. Apopulation of many millions diverted the ordinarycourse of monarchical succession without the accompanyinghorrors of revolutionary bloodshed.The soldiers and subjects scarcely ever intermixedbayonets ; and although the " memorable threedays" were not unattended with slaughter, yet, consideringwhat was in contemplation and execution,the marvel is that political excitement was not followedup by a more lengthened and wide-spreadingmischief. When one thinks of the quantity ofnoble and virtuous blood shed in our own count r\,during the civil wars of the fifteenth and seventeenthcenturies, we may, as Christians, indulge inequal wonder and consolation that the French lu -volution of 1831 bore so slight a resemblance to876 LONDON. [Pastor** Advicethat of the forty years preceding when the Guillotineknew no rest, and the soil of France wassaturated with human blood.At home in our own country at the momentof the Premier's taking the helm, there were strongsymptoms of a perturbed and perverted feelingamong great masses of the middling and lowerorders of society. With the latter, the evidences ofIncendiarism were as general as appalling ; andmen seemed not only to act recklessly, but to lettheir " thinking aloud" be preludes to such acts.A " Public Form of Prayer" was ordered "onaccount of the troubled state of certain parts ofthe United Kingdom." At this crisis, it struck methat I had a public duty to perform ; and I did itaccording to my notions, and to the best of my ability.I wrote (" calais currentissimo" as may be tooevident!) a little pamphlet, entitled, " A Word ofCaution and Comfort to the middle and lowerClasses of Society, being a Pastor's Advice to hisFlock in a time of Trouble." No name was affixed; but mine was neither concealed nor disavowedas that of the author of the tract which was sold atthe trifling sum of sixpence. I believe the sale wasThe following, from the form of prayer abovementioned, was prefixedas a title : " Restore, O Lord, to thy people the quiet enjoymentof the many and great blessings which we have received from thybounty : defeat and frustrate the malice of wicked and turbulent men,and turn their hearts : have pity, O Lord, on the simple and ignorantwho have been led astray, and recal them to a sense of their duty."to his Flocked LONDON. 877pretty general ; and to have cleared my expenses, only,was something beyond a negative consolation.I desire respectfully, and dispassionately, to callthe reader's attention for a few minutes to one ortwo circumstances connected with this little pamphlet;and I shall first beg to put him in possession of anextract or two from it, so as to furnish him withsome materials for the exercise of his own judgment.It begins thus :My Christian Brethren,"In every point of view, I ought to address you by sucha designation. But I address you in a time of trouble'and especially of * peril among FALSE BRETHREN.' I willcall it, if you please, political peril ; for physical and moralperils are the ordinary lot of humanity. The first wish ofmy heart and bent of my understanding incline to givingyou a word of CAUTION. Attend to this caution ; and youwill see how COMFORT springs out of it Do not mistrustmy motives ; nor doubt the efficacy of the advice which youare about to receive. Follow it honestly and manfully ; andit will lead you, in the end, into the ' patris of peace.'It cannot be denied that the present is a moment ofmore than usual anxiety and agitation among ' all sortsand conditions of men.' Some of these anxieties may probablyhave no foundation : but many are grounded uponindisputable matter of fact Even the stillness of night,and the hours commonly allotted to repose, have been invadedby a thoroughly mischievous spirit of destruction : aspirit, as indefinite in its object, as it is diabolical in itsmeans of carrying it into execution. The labours of thehusbandman have been rendered fruitless ; and, sometimes,the hand which helped to hind the sheaf hath !> . n instrumentalto its wanton destruction.

Inthese instances, both God and man are set at defiance,"&c. &c.After a brief sketch of many of the disturbancesabroad, and in the Low Countries, I bring the readerto a Home View, and speak of the Governmentthen existing, as I have been, and always shall be,conscientiously disposed both to think and to speak.It is the utterance of sentiments upon broad publicprinciples. Whatever might have been my individualrespect for some of the then Members of theCabinet, that had no influence either on my principlesor professions. I had no obligations to acknowledge.I have had none since j but here I mustbe supposed deliberately to repeat what I have beforeadvanced.Look now AT HOME, and bless God as you look, uponthe state of things which, comparatively, there meets youreyes. You have a King beloved, as he ought to be beloved: a King, who, in almost every sentiment which heutters, and every action which he betrays, proves himself, notonly to be thoroughly English, but thoroughly humane ;who incorporates and identifies himself as it were with thewants and wishes of his subjects : who expects homageonly because it is impossible to be withheld grafted as it isupon the stock of respect and esteem. It was said of HenryIV. of France, that he was their ' good King,' because hewished for nothing better than that every one of his subitohis Flitch.] LONDON. 879sects should have a < chicken boiling in his pot It maybetruly said of William IV., that he desires nothing betterthan that every Englishman should have h is roast beef turninground his spit. The good conduct of his subjects mustbe the principal means of carrying this desire into effect.You have a CONSTITUTION the work and the gloryof ages: the admiration and the envy of the world. Faultsand imperfections it cannot fail to have, because it is human,and necessarily partakes of human fallibility. You have aGOVERNMENT, strong, vigorous, upright, well intentioned:a government, which will not fail to correct what is corrigible,according to opportunities granted and means supplied ; andto modify what is incongruous or verging to decay;a government, which has not only the courage to give apledge, but the virtue to carry it into effect. I desire to beunderstood as not wishing to institute comparisons betweenone set of ministers and another. I have neither the meansnor the ability to entitle such comparison to any respectfulattention. I speak only of existing facts : of the presentmembers of his Majesty's government : of men of highbirth, high alliance : possessing a spirit incapable of basecompromise : above corruption : above suspicion : lovers ofthe church, and supporters of its best interests.Again : in a consideration of HOME enjoyments. Frommatters of State, let us speak of those of the CHURCH : ofthat established church, to which, for twenty-six years past,it hath been my lot professionally to belong. More able,more active, more successful Ministers than myself, theremay be in abundance ; but one more zealous, or more disposedto do all the good in his power, both within andwithout his church, I will not readily allow. My consciencetells me that I can fearlessly make this assertion : and,as I can make it now, so do I trust to make it HEREAFTER.I have served, if I may so speak, an apprenticeship to thespiritual matters entrusted to my charge: and during thoseseven years in which I have resided among you, I hope that880 LONDON.

The consequencesrest with GOD *."The reader has had some notion of the commencement of this littletract; may I further venture upon his patience in making him acquaintedwith its conclusion ?I have now gone through the entire first division of this PastoralAddress. I have endeavoured to awake in you a sense of CAUTIONrespecting the surrendering of the absolute advantages you possess fordoubtful equivalents and respecting the ordinary character of thosewho counsel such a surrender. It remains only to make a short appealto you on the score of the COMFORTS absolutely enjoyed. I call themcomforts in every sense of the word. Your house is your castle. Itcannot be invaded with impunity. Your person is protected both withinand without that house. RIGHT is as much the poorest man's, as it isthe richest man's, civil inheritance. You may do what you will withyour property while living, and direct it to be bestowed in any manneryou please after death. I speak of the exercise of this right upongeneral principles, and in the ordinary way. Now, these alone are greatcomforts : but it is the law of the land which gives them : and to thatsame law you must be conformable. The moment you are born, youbecome an object of its protection. As long as you live you exist underthe same protection. As a natural and necessary result, therefore, youare bound to obey those laws. Shall the child resist the parent, in theact of receiving that parent's arms thrown round it for protection ?ff Think a little what you would get by disaffection and studiedresistance. You might see injury in one mode of proceeding, and yourneighbour in another. You seek this remedy, and he advises that.Multiply these instances of discrepancy : and collect the suffrages of awhole street and to what intelligible and attainable end would thosesuffrages or opinions direct you ? Trust me, you would become thet his Flock.] LONDON. $81Whatever might be the result, on the score ofpublic opinion, for good or for evil, I had abundantreason to be well satisfied that this labour of threeevenings had met the unqualified approbation ofsport of every fanciful suggestion ; and, in the ultimate result, the objectof your own secret scorn and derision. I can conceive no severerreproach and punishment than TIIIS. Under every point of view, connectedwith things temporal and things spiritual, every rational maushould be taught to consider the nature of the change proposed, ere hebeled to adopt or to reject it. Above all things, should every rationalman judge or obtain some competent means of judging of thequalifications of those, who, in proposing change, have frequentlyrevolution at heart : and before the clamour of the factious be listenedto, strive to make yourselves well acquainted with the liberties and thecomforts which you actually enjoy.I feel persuaded, that, during this ' time of trouble* and agitation,many a man, once engaged in an extension of the mischief, has, uponreconsideration, seen ' the evil of his ways,' and turned from them,heart and soul, to his family and to his Maker. Such have indeed goodneed to ask pardon of God and man. Bad as may have been the past,let uspiope that it is not wholly without good for the future. Let ushope that a lesson has been learnt, not to invade the rights, nor destroythe property of individuals, under the delusion that either may be donewith impunity. Permanent blessings are sometimes the result of partialsufferings ; but let it be remembered that the blood of the guilty mustatone for the violation of the innocent ! Above all things, let it beremembered that a HIGHER power, than anything human, must be supplicated,' in all our troubles and adversities,' of whatever description,whensoever they oppress us : ' that, in the hands of that same powerare ' the issues of life and death ;' and that, both in private and inpublic, we must entreat him to ' have mercy upon us : ' to ' save anddefend us from all dangers, ghostly and bodily : that he will keep uafrom all sin and wickedness, and from our ghostly enemy, and fromeverlasting death ; and this we trust he will do of his mercy and goodness,through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.'Such, in conclusion, my Christian brethren, such is the languageof our incomparable Catechism. ' Happy are we if we knowthings ; but happier far if we DO them.' "> I88-2 LONDON. [Pastor's Advicemy friends. . .both Whig and Tory. I sent a copy,"as in duty bound," to Mr. Archdeacon Glover,my rural clerical Commander, and his opinion inreply is well worth a place below*.

It is well calculated to meet a crisis, which,thank God, has now, like a hurricane, spent its fury and disappeared ;and as good often comes out of evil, so do I hope that the late excitements,which, after all, were not the fruits of mere wantonness andrestlessness of temper, but of long and heavy oppression, will be productiveof ultimate advantage to society at large. The clamour againstthe clergy has been the pure work of the farmers, or of a few minorlandlords, whose interests were considered as identified. The presenttithe-system does, however, ' work not well :' it has not even the negativepraise arrogated for the borough-system of representation in theHouse of Commons ; and I am very anxious to see the Clergy themselvesstepping forward to petition for a mode of provision more convenientto the present condition of society, the interests of agriculture,and the PEACE of our ( SION.' And this, I feel quite confident, may beeffected by a judicious, and yet very moderate alteration. To an allotmentof land, or to a commutation for a tax on land, I most decidedlyobject.

His Lordshipadded what will be gratifying to read "ThankGod, in my neighbourhood, in Wales, all is loyaltyand good humour, and no one wants work or fairwages." " I am glad (concludes the Noble Writer)to hear that your Sunday Library progresses well,as the modern phrase is, and hope it will be moreand more countenanced."

Under the operation of allthese impressions, I put forth a small 4s. 6d.pamphlet, entitled BIBLIOPHOBIA, with a feignedname as that of the Author*.

" !"But such was the fact ; and in the monthof June ensuing the library in question was disposedof under the hammer of Mr. Evans. The venerableowner of it had sprinkled the catalogue with afew spicy notes, which afforded an increased relishto its perusal.See from page 63 to 65 of the JBibliophobia. But perhaps Dr.Valpy's apology for the sale of his books is best told in one of his ownnotes in the catalogue of his library, thus :190.

[Lent Lectures.One thing is undeniably obvious. One object hasbeen clearly established. Since my removal toforth by any effort, however humble, which has the salvation of immortalsouls for its object. One consolation is unquestionably derivablefrom the publication of these pages. Nearly the whole of the firstvolume will at least be found to evince an early zeal in the dischargeof professional duties; since it is the fruit of the labour of the first twoyears after having taken Holy Orders. The materials of that volumehave, however, been both corrected and enlarged upon a subsequentdelivery of them from the pulpit ; and if the sinews and muscles continuethe same, the form and the substance have been, I would hope,considerably improved. The present both within and without theChurch, is undoubtedly a CRISIS. But I have lived long enough tosee the reaction of opinions hastily adopted, and of principles crudelyformed. To anathematise bodies or professions, from the occasionalirregularity of individuals of whom those bodies are composed, is atonce perverting and stultifying the very end and objects of all moralreasoning. To condemn systems, merely because they are old, andwithout a nice observance of the operations or leanings of their componentparts, is surely not the line of conduct which a wise and agood-hearted man would be disposed to pursue. On the other hand,it must neither be concealed nor disavowed, that, as in the progress ofall mundane affairs both imperfection and decay will present themselves,so will it be better to look the character of that imperfection anddecay resolutely in the face ; and to adopt timely and efficient remediesfor their removal. In this spirit it will be advisable, where practicable,to substitute zeal for indifference, activity for slothfulness, and talentfor inability. There is yet time and scope enough for the correction oferror, and for the beneficial influence of all the results emanating fromthe adoption of such a measure.Meanwhile, let every MINISTER of the GOSPEL remember, that he,of all descriptions of persons, is armed with weapons of the most admirabletemper and construction for the resistance of much of thatfierce clamour and wild outcry which is just now directed against theChurch Establishment of this 'country.

With the late Mr. Nichols, of Gentleman-Magazine celebrity,he was not less intimate. I have recorded, in a somewhat drollnote (page 748, ante), his first visit to myself in the year 1811. Whereeverhe went he diffused around him good humour and useful intelligence.He had lived long in literary circles, and worked at as hard andheavy labour as any pioneer or sapper and miner at the siege of Buhrt-poor. His style is easy and perspicuous ; and he always sets about thecollection of his facts with a straightforwardness and sincerity which giveno trifling value to his labours. His anecdotes, which were numerous,were told in few and ' ' pleasant" words ; and I scarcely know a manwho, from his years and opportunities, had he been so disposed, couldhave bequeathed to us a more pleasant manual of anecdotes in the shapeof Ana, than himself: because, however spite and malice unfortunatelyLONDON. s:>)may life animate his gallant bosom who used tocomplete the number of this truly estimable ///////,//-go a good way in sprinkling lucubrations of this kind with a sort ofpalatable *//, yet Chalmers's ANA would have had no need of such materialsto maintain their vitality. Mr. Alexander Chalmers has the meritof having left behind him the best Collection of our Poets and Dictionaryof Biography ; and deeply is it to be regretted that his material foranother edition of the latter had not been further extended.What I have said of its author in the Library Companion (p. 492-3,second edition) is not a whit beyond what his labours merited.

His library, almost wholly biographical, furnishinga delectable opportunity for the enrichment of collections of a similarcomplexion, was sold by auction, in this year, by Messrs. Sothebys : prefixedto the catalogue of which there is a life of the late owner of thebooks, taken from the obituary in the Gentleman's Magazine, which Iunderstand to have been written by the intimate friend of the deceased,Bowyer Nichols, Esq., the son of his old and dear friend, John Nichols.It is judiciously and instructively executed. But I have a " tale to tell"touching the sale of the library of my deceased friend. Among hisbooks was a Latin Bible, of the date of 1557, which had belonged toMelanchthon, and had the cost price of 2s. 6d., in the fly-leaf, as thatat which it had been probably obtained by its owner at a book-stall.Fortunately for those who were to derive benefit from the sale of thislibrary, the Melancholic eye of Mr. Sotheby, jun. glanced upon thisprecious volume, which was published two years before the death ofMelancthon, and exhibited many curious manuscript notices, of importancesufficient to incorporate it among the books of DR. Loss ; at thesale of which library it was purchased by Messrs Payne and Foss, forDr. Hawtrey, the head master of Eton school, for 10/. 5s. It could notbe better placed.I have made mention, in the work quoted in the last note but one,of Mr. Combes's attachment to DEAR OLD ISAAC WALTON (a bad mancan never be a lover of the ANGLER of that truly original as well asamiable man), and of his former habits of reading him while ramblingalong the margin of the Thames, or seated on a stile, to return to hiswell-dressed omelette or fricandeau at Henley, the place of his abode ;just in time to receive his little circle of friends at his hospitable table,where the flavour of his wall-fruits is yet inferior to that of the " pleasantdiscourse" which always circulates around it : and then, the quietrubber in the trellis-papered drawing-room towards eventide.

Hereyou will find him as ambitious to deserve the chairacer of a general and tasteful bookseller, as if hehad never published a volume of his own. His lateneighbour, Mr. Lilly, is as full of goodly promise, asheis distinguished for courteous civilities. WithMr. Major, in former days, I used frequently to meetthe late Reverend James Dallaway, at one time employedby the former to edit a new edition of Walpole9 s Anecdotes of Painting in England ; a workwell and truly" executed by him*. Mr. Dallawayhad a natural and quick turn, or rather love, for thefine arts. His vicarage at Leatherhead " was a thingdoubled; and active and intelligent commanders placed to guard them.I do not believe that there is another similar establishment, where somany and such able CONSERVATORS are to be found. But I have morethan an ordinary reason to place my friend JOHN GEORGE CHILDREN,Esq. in the foreground of the text. In doing so, nothing borderingupon comparisons is even thought of. I recognise in him not only oneof the Secretaries of the Royal Society, and a man, from toe to top,brimful of scientific ardour and scientific experience, but the gentlemanand the friend ; united to ONE, whose transcendant generosity ofspirit is only exceeded by the warmth and the steadiness of her attachments.I speak advisedly when I say so.

The groundsof the latter were the main attraction, and these Ionce saw in company with our common friend " theMajor," to the greatest possible advantage. Wemade a day " express" to go down to see the wondersof these grounds. The day was one in high summerbright, hot, oppressive just calculated toenable us to enjoy, as it did, the cool transparencyof the river Mole in a bocage stifled with honeysuckles,which was fixed on its margin upon agreensward as soft and rich as velvet. Our hosthad plunged a bottle of his best sherry for anhour's cooling in the stream ; and as it sparkledin the glass, and cooled our fevered tongues, hewould regale us with sundry pleasant stories nowa tale from Boccace and now an anecdote fromthe Phcedo of Plato. Mr. Dallaway was a man ofkindly feelings, but disappointed views. His penwas the ever ready instrument in transmitting thefirst emotions of his heart. Some of his letters toMr. Major evince great steadiness of attachingand no infelicitous diction in composition t.There is a privately printed book, called Lutheran, five FortiLethertaani, with vignette etchings of different objects and views in thegarden, and executed by the tasteful burin of Mrs. Dallaway.t I select a few specimens (furnished me by his publisher) of Mr.Dallaway 's correspondence, connected with the progress of the new editionof WALPOI.K.

"SUAK.SPKAKK.BEHOLD my "woods and pastures I" Yet letnot the owners of the several libraries about to besketched" rather than described, take umbrage,or start back amazed, at the adoption of the abovetitle. It has no reference whatever to the shiftingor changing properties of their BOOK-TREASURES. Iam willing and anxious to believe that they maymaintain their respective positions till the close ofthis century at least. The above motto is adoptedmerely in reference to the very scant time and hurriedmovements in which, like the figures across thedisk of Banquo's glass, the libraries in question mustof necessity be introduced in this the last chapter ofthe Author's " REMINISCENCES."

Languors not lessfaithful transcript of the original letter prefixed to a version of thePsalms by St. Austin, of the end of the eleventh or the beginning ofthe twelfth centuries, from a MS. in the public library at Rouen. Thisinteresting ornament is fully described by the French artist in hisMemoire sur la Calligraphic des Manuscrits du Moyen Age; and iswell designed to represent, in its chief ornaments, a few of the leadingevents in the life of David. At top, he should seem to be representedas a shepherd-lad blowing the horn while tending the sheep : a littlebelow, as attacking and overcoming the lion, which was about to invadethe flock. To the left, a little below, David wears his kingly crown,and is seated, playing the harp. Again, below, and occupying thelarger compartment of the letter, there is a representation of his combatwith Goliath whose flattened helmet, with the nasal safeguard andquilted armour, bespeak, as I conceive, the above period of the executionof the subject.But for the successful execution of this and of all similar letters in theemblazonment of ART, let the Reader possess himself, if practicable, ofthe beautiful and unrivalled work of Mr. SHAW, in his Illuminated Ornamentsselected from Manuscripts of the Middle Ayes; 4to. and folio.

I must refer the inquisitive reader to Mr. Martin'sbeautiful and interesting book relating to libraries and private presses(to which in my seventh chapter I have been so frequently indebted),for a more particular, and yet very sketchy, account of the extraordinaryMS. TREASURES in the collection of Sir Thomas, which are estimatedby an admirable judge (the Rev. Joseph Hunter), in terms of no ordinaryoccurrence. " Ex uno disc omne." More than once has ourcommon friend, Sir Frederick Madden, assured me, that he has beenoften imbedded in book-luxury in Sir Thomas's mansion, of which theuninitiated cannot even have the good luck to dream. He has beenseated, all alone, at an oblong oaken table, measuring 15 feet by 7,entirely covered with the oldest MSS. upon ROM AUNT LORE; uponwhich all the Knights of the Round Table seemed at one moment to besitting, with their respective banners and cognizance waving aboveas they well might ; for never was such homage before paid to the memoryof their achievements ! But the MSS. of the worthy Baronet areof all classes and of all periods. You cannot mention one class, butwhat he has an ample store of illustrations upon it.

Of the pecuniary value ofthis most marvellous collection, it would be rather folly than indelicacyto hazard even a conjecture; but I can say with confidence,, becausewith truth, that the united amount of all the purchases of the greatcollections mentioned in the text, preceding Sir Thomas Phillips's,would be scarcely half of what HE has expended in the gratification ofhis darling and most delectable pursuit.And he merits all his acquisitions from the exquisite relish manifestedin the pursuit of them, and his real love of intelligence in theliterature of the olden times. His two papers in the Transactions ofthe Royal Society of Literature, upon some of the MSS. in the Low-countrylibraries, show that he is " made of the proper stuff;" whilehis personal escort (all night long, in a posthaste) of a huge waggon -load of MSS., in route from Oxford to Middle Hill, triumphantly provesthe ruling passion of his mind. Nor college fare, nor college friends,could divert him from this escort; and even Sir Frederick Maddenclapped hands, and shouted aloud in ecstacy, as the chaise drove off ! . .at a measured pace . . by the side of the ponderous waggon.See particularly the FIRST DAY of the Bibliographical Cameron.t In the " Richardson Correspondence" just privately printed byMiss Currer, there is a letter from Thoresby, the antiquary, to Dr.Richardson (Miss Currer's great grandfather), of the date of 1708-9, inwhich the following notice occurs of HARLEY'S passion for collectingMSS. : " I was surprised to find so prodigious a number of originalcharters, bulls, manuscripts, as are of late collected and purchased, atvast rates, daily, by Mr. HARLEY, the late secretary." p. 97.PRIVATE LIBRARIES. 913giving it a steady attention, before I sally forth tolift the knocker of my near neighbour and friend,Sir Francis Freeling.

And yet,before my specimen is selected, it is my duty tomake especial mention of the MS.

Grenville.But three more collections to notice in Londonand these very briefly : although one of them, alone,would furnish materials for the composition of oneof the most interesting and beautiful bibliographicalvolumes in the world. It is that of the Right HON.THOMAS GRENVILLE to which I can only allude, andto which so many pages of my previous productionshave been indebted for so large a share of interestwhich they might contain. It is more than negativeconsolation to be sensible of the debt which I haveendeavoured to discharge in the language of thankfulnessfor all favours conferred from that quarter.Not only for its dimensions (and yet TWENTY ThousandVOLUMES cannot be said to be contained in anut shell /) have I never seen anything like it, but Ican have no conception of anything going beyondit. In Spanish lore it is exquisitely rich ; and therecent acquirement, not only of the highest pricedbook sold at the sale of Mr. Hebe's library(Tyrant IL Banco), but of very many of themore prominent cast of character in that same Collection,seemed only to be wanting to render such aLibrary as that in Cleveland Square as complete. . .as all earthly things can count upon being.But a passing and a final word upon the BibliothecaHeberiana here alluded to. It is now fastmelting away. Seven successive snow-balls of enormousdimensions*, have already disappeared ; andSee page 366, ante.R. Hebtr, *</.] PRIVATE LIBRARIES. U39four more of equal size are quickly to fall intodissolution. Within six months to come, everyvolume will have also probably taken its departurefor ever ; and an aggregate of perhaps some onehundred thousand volumes will have been disposedof under the hammers of Messrs. Sothebys,Evans, Stanley, and Wheaten. Considering theshort time allowed for the dispersion of such an unparallelledmass of Books the celerity of dispatch,in the preparation of the several catalogues, byMessrs. Payne and Foss, has been perhaps equallyunparallelled. It boots not now to introduce my ownnotions, or my earliest views, of the best methodto have been adopted in the disposal of so largeand so valuable a body of property in the shapeof BOOKS. Every subsequent reflection has onlyconfirmed the propriety of those early views. Whenit is known, as a fact, that the late Owner of thesebooks declared, several years before he went abroad,that his Library had then cost him Ninety-twoTHOUSAND POUNDS, and that the Individual*, towhom that communication was made, supposed thesum must have been DOUBLED before Mr. Hewersdecease, it seems both a natural and necessary consequenceto infer, that its net produce even nowwould be nearer half than a third of the sum originauthority is ray friend Mr. Markland, who received the intelligencefrom the late Roger Wilbraham, Esq., to whom .Mr. IMicr personallymade the communication. Mr. Wilbraham added to Mr. Mark-land,that he supposed the sum in question had been nouBun>.040 SKETCHES OF [/?. Hebe, Esq.nelly expended. Time alone will solve that point.Meanwhile Messrs. Payne and Foss have most faithfullyacted up to the letter and spirit of their instructions; and the part, just published, of the Manuscripts,is really a most creditable performance.But, in the probable result of all these unitedSales, there are several drawbacks to be taken intoconsideration. First, the times have been clearlyadverse to the public sales of Libraries. The bibliomaniais greatly subdued even with well-disposedand wealthy purchasers. Books, like other objectsof pursuit, or articles of taste, have become of easyobtainment . chiefly in consequence of their constantimportation from abroad. But, more than either,or than the whole of these drawback-considerations,must the character or complexion of Mr. Hebe'slibrary itself be taken into consideration : first, inrespect to condition, and secondly, in regard toduplicates. The condition of the books, generallyspeaking, was far from tempting ; and I once hadit from the mouth of their Owner, that 5000/. mightbe well laid out upon their coating. The bindingof the Harleigh Library (chiefly in red morocco)cost Lord Oxford 18,0001. The duplicates the triplicatesand even more of rare and costly volumes,had no end. Of the first Aristotle and first Platoalone, there were, one with the other, hardly fewerthan five copies ; each not only throwing the otherinto a darker shade, but thereby impoverishing thevalue of every other copy in the market. TheLord rrinw.] PRIVATE LIBRARIES.system of doubling, trebling, and even quadrupleseemed to have neither definite object nor boundary,and is only traceable to a rapaciousness of hungerand thirst, in the INDIVIDUAL COLLECTOR, such asthe world never saw before, and is not likely to seeagain. The foregoing pages * too strongly attest myformer attachment to that Individual to supposethat, on the present occasion, I can have any otherwish than that a PLENTIFUL HARVEST may crownthe exertions of those who have brought their sicklesinto the field.But it is getting late, and there is much of LibrarySketching yet to encounter. I will take thereader with me to Upper Brook Street, and introducehim for a few minutes only to the select andpromising collection of the Honourable R. Curzon,a young man deeply imbued with that thorough indomitableardour in the cause, which knows noabatement, and will lead in the end to the acquisitionof some of the rarest treasures. The last letterwhich I had the gratification of receiving from thisenterprising Knight," is full of good omen.

But Cicero,Lucretius, Pindar, Tacitus, Thucydides, &c. are allwith him in their large and flowing vestments, includingthe Poetics of Aristotle by Tyrwhitt.

" Sir (said he tome)here is my only comfort. Whenever I want information,Buxton never fails me. He was themost deeply learned of all Hebraists." Leaving myrabbinical Buxtorfian, I was quietly threading one ortwo more of the other boudoirs each of them havinga lamp suspended from the centre when, turningabruptly to the left, an half-opened door induced meto enter the room itself. Not a creature was withinsight or hearing. I entered, and the first and onlyobject which caught my eye, was a colossal bust ofBonaparte, upon a therm, in the centre of the room,from the chisel of Canova. The concentrated light ofthe suspended lamp shone full upon the countenance.I seemed for a short moment to be holding conversationwith the ORIGINAL . now, unmoved by ambition,uninfluenced by cabals, agitated by opposition.At the foot of the therm lay one of thegreat choral books just mentioned*.

Miss CURRER is not acollector of the caprice of a day. From earliest youth,her passion both for reading and amassing bookshas been extreme ; and fortunately her means enableher to gratify this passion to an extent of placingher at THE HEAD of all female Collectors in Europe.In fact, as I have often remarked, this Lady is asort of modern CHRISTINA of the North. But shehas been fortunate in building a superstructure upona broad and splendid foundation. The Beverley Li.(>r<try, descending with the property of her greatgrandfather, Dr. Richardson*, has enabled her toMiss Currer has very recently, under the editorial care of herfriend DAWSON TURNER, Esq., put forth, but not published, an interestingoctavo volume, with plates, entitled, " Extracts from the Literaryand Scientific Correspondence of Richard Richardson, Med.F. R. S., of Beverley, Yorkshire. Yarmouth, 1835, 8vo." This volumeis botanical from beginning to end ; exhibiting an ardour and perseveranceand tact such as can with difficulty be conceived; and writtenwhen some of the greatest botanists of the day were living, and the starof LINNAEUS was just beginning to irradiate the horizon of that science.950 SKETCHES OF [Miss Richardsonerect one of such, splendour and extent, as to filltwo rooms, whose united lengths (besides a bayBut the " dramatis persons" (if I may so speak) of this volume, arebest brought under the reader's eye in the language of its learned editor.The 'Richardson's Correspondence' fills twelve folio volumes,, andwould, if printed, probably form eight of the same bulk as the present.I had two objects in view, when first I solicited the loan of it from MissCurrer. I thought it might possibly throw light upon the early historyof Sir Joseph Banks, whose life I have for some time been engaged inwriting; and I also conjectured that it might afford me assistance inanother of my favourite projects, a new and enlarged edition of Dr.Pulteney's ' Sketches of Botany in England.' In the former of thesehopes I found myself entirely disappointed : so long a period had elapsedfrom the close of the life of Dr. Richardson to the commencement ofthe scientific career of Sir Joseph Banks, that their pursuits did notpossess any point of union. *In my other object I should not have experienced a similar disappointment.The information to be derived from these letters, and from thecorrespondence of Sloane and Sherard, could not fail to be highlyvaluable to any one engaged in a similar pursuit. But I felt that Ishould not do justice to the memory of Dr. Richardson by such a limitation.I had not proceeded far in the examination of his papers, beforeit was evident to me, that, regarded collectively, they were of themselvessufficient to answer two other and more important purposes ; tofurnish materials for the biography of the individual to whom they areaddressed, and to supply such a fund of knowledge towards the annalsof natural history, during the period they embrace, as merited a morehonourable distinction than the being embodied in another work, ofwhich, from its nature, they could be made to form but an inconsiderablepart."These " performers in the botanical drama" are then further shewnup by the same pen ; and, as far as I have had opportunities of verification,I find the strictures correct. Some of the effusions of Dilleniusand Gronovius have much diverted me ; especially the former, page262-3, in his conjectures about the unknown herbaceous treasures whichThe dark, unfathom'd caves of ocean bear."But Mr. Turner shall continue his sketches.They also enable us to estimate the characters of Dr. Richardson'sdifferent correspondents: the generosity of the 'consul Sherard; theselfish closeness of his brother ; the gentlemanly feelings of Sloane ; thetT.] 1'IUVATL LIIJUA!

Upon the disposition also, and the habits, andthe pursuits of certain other less generally known individuals, and particularlyof Uvedale and of Buddha, some light will be thrown by theprinting of this correspondence. The former of these, the successfulcompetitor of Sir Isaac Newton, at Cambridge, is very slightly noticedby Pulteney ; the latter, not at all ; though his knowledge was such asto have caused him to be designated by Mr. Vernon as ' the top ofmoss-croppers in England and though of frequent occurrence, thebeauty and agreeable odour of the shrub which bears his name, wouldnaturally make botanists desirous of learning particulars about theman'The name, or rather the letters, of Hearne now and then enrichthis necessarily rare volume, as only 250 copies were printed. But it isnot surprising that the GREAT GRAND-DAUGHTER should inherit thebibliomaniacal passion from such a source as this; for in one of Dr.Richardson's letters to his son Richard, see with what ardour he describes,and with what delight he views (and which I, in my collegedays, and in the library of St. John's, used as delighted to look upon)Cooper's Anatomy.

There are, in fact, FOUR PLATES attached to the catalogue of MissCurrer's library, to be presently noticed. The third is an exterior viewof Eshton Hall, which has quite an Elizabethan air. The fourth plateis a view from the library window ; in which view the distant hill iscalled Also.

Therewas a first intention to have pictures, and no books, in the second room ;but who can resist the growing and soft contagion of Bores? The fairOwner " soon found out that one room would by no means contain herbooks." Now as to PICTURES I find, on going through the RichardsonCORRESPONDENCE, that old Wander Gucht, a sort of fashionableengraver in his day, used to cater for Dr. Richardson in Italian paintingsand Rembrandt prints; and this volume bears evidence (LettersCLIX. Lxiii.) that he was " no bad hand at a bargain" though, as anengraver, especially in Hearne's pieces, he was absolutely below contempt.In this first letter to the doctor's son (whom the father used tocall " Dear Dick), of the date of Sept. 9, 1749, he talks of letting himhave a genuine Nicol Poussin (five feet high by three feet and a halfwide) for thirty-five guineas; assuring him that "no person livingbesides should have it under fifty." Then follows an account of anHannibal Caracas considered, although damaged in several places, " thebest picture of the master then in England."

Since the publication of her Catalogue, Miss Currerinforms me that she has only purchased the following article, of anynote, of Mr. Henry John, for 631. It is a very extraordinary copy ofClaude's LIBER VERITATIS, by Earlom, with duplicate plates in thecharacter of etchings, proofs, variations, in four volumes folio, containing500 plates ; the fourth volume having the etchings and variations.This extraordinary copy was made up by the late Mr. Baker (the Quis-juliusof the Bibliomania) who was well acquainted with Earlom, andhad the pickings of his portfolio.

Neither the late Lord Spencer, nor myself,Private LIBRARIES. 961nor even the late Mr. Horn, had any knowledgeof these extraordinary relics, which certainly rendersit doubtful where the first Donatus was printed,especially if we consider the next article.Here is a fragment of Donatus in the Speculumtype of the supposed LAWRENCE ROSTER.

This fragmentbegins thus :u'ma bedinatio quot twas terminate fcabet &uas quae a et s (Ohtot terminations tres quae.A full page has twenty-seven lines. It is doubtlessa great curiosity, and is a further proof of the earlyDutch presses being devoted to the working of elementarytreatises of education.Here comes a great rarity, in the shape of aPrinter, of whose type there is not a single specimenin the Spencer Library. This also is a Donatus in962 SKETCHES OF [Archdeaconfolio ; but I differ, toto cell, from its learned Owner,who considers it to be a Xylographiccd production,or a book printed with wooden blocks. Onthe contrary, I consider it to be decidedly metal,and of a date not anterior to 1480. The reader shalljudge for himself by the following fac-simile of thecolophon :The book consists of only two leaves, or three pages.There are twenty-six lines in a full page. It beingimpossible, within reasonable limits, to give even aprecis of treasures of this description in the Archdeacon'slibrary, I hasten only to the further mentionof a production, of about the same period, andwith all the air of wood-block printing ; but, in fact,not so. It is a small thin quarto volume, entitledConfessional, and printed throughout in the Germanlanguage. The very first page of it presentsthe following figure of Christ, of which the draperyin the back ground, running upon a brass pole withliiitler.']PRIVATE l,IBHAKIi:vrings, is precisely in many instances in the modernfashion.The reverse is blank. On the recto of the secondleaf the text begins thus : " Ici armor lundiger,SKETCHES OF[Archdeacon&c." A full page has twenty lines. At the sixthline we read thus : " She Horn Reichert Smacksvnd Taste, vnd dutch lose neigug der Offerticket Gyntikeit Has Horns Vnmessigkeit" &c.On the reverse of the second leaf, there is anotherwhole length, with the Dove to the left, and theAlmighty to the right, holding the Commandmentsto Moses, who is kneeling to receive them on amount below r . Two figures, one male, and the otherfemale, draped, are kneeling to the right. At thebottom of the opposite page, " Das under gebot."Every page has the word "gebot" at bottom. Onthe reverse of folio v., being the "vis gebote ," isthe following:Ihttler.'] IMIIN.VIT. uiiKMUES.The figure of Christ, as in the preceding fac-simile,is repeated. Five pages follow. This little volumeis doubtless a great curiosity of its kind.Having fully entered upon the Fifteenth Century,and aware of the theological as well as classicalattainments of the Owner of this Library, I may aswell "sketch" a few only of the chief treasures orgreat guns in that department and this, before Ienter the Aldine Cabinet, from which the " revocaregradus" will not be of such facile execution. Ofcourse my first attention are the Bibles ; and yet, asaprelude, I may as well notice the three block booksof Ars Memoranda, Apocah/jtxis, and Biblia Pau-peru.But of Bibles properly so called, here arethe Polyglots of Menes and Walton, the formeruncut, the latter the republican copy.

But the extraordinary gemin this department is Dr. Loss's copy of the OpusculaTheological of MELANCHTHON purchased inMay last for 37/., a folio volume and forming a sortof common-place hook of its once illustrious Possessor.Young Mr. Sotheby very naturally, andvery commendably, runs riot in his descriptionof itt.The only known VELLUM copy of this most magnificent productionof the press of Sweynhym and Pamartz, is that in the Imperial Libraryat Vienna, which had belonged to the famous Cardinal Cessation, andis described in my Tour, vol. iii. p. 304, second edition.t See the Bibliotheca Klossiana, No. 4637, with a minute 'and carefullydrawn out list of the contents of this most extraordinary volumewhich, though better placed it cannot be than it now is, in a privatecollection, ought nevertheless to have found its way into the precinctsof the Bodleian Library. This is the last time an opportunity willpresent itself to speak, as I feel myself in justice bound to speak, of thelucid order and pains-taking industry, as well as the spirited display ofgraphic embellishment, exhibited in Mr. Sotheby's, jun. catalogue ofthe Library of Dr. Loss of Frankfort, which was sold in this countryin 1835. The collection, especially to a student in typographical antiquities,offered opportunities of acquiring rarities, such as I do notremember to have before presented themselves. The total amount ofthe sale was 226 1/., a sum which, considering the present deterioratedstate of the market, may be considered by no means dissatisfactory.The highest price obtained was 39/. for the Latin Bible of 1477, printedby Soberer, exclusively on account of the wonderful illustrations,in the shape of notes, by its once learned and pious possessor, Melancthon.Mr. Sotheby exhausts the vocabulary of panegyric in commentingupon it. It was purchased by the house of Messrs. LongmanPrivate LliUl UMKS.Of CLASSICS as might have been expected fromthe long established celebrity of the Possessorhere are Fifteeners without end; but I can onlysupply room for a few. Of CICERO, there is theDe Officiis of 1465, UPON VELLUM ; and the Epistlead Attinnn, 1-1-70, first edition. Of Q. Curtis,the Demosthenes (both), Eutropius, Horace (firstwith a date), Homer, Justin, Livy, the two Lines,Quintilian, Martial, Tacitus, and Virgil, the FIRSTEDITIONS ; but my friend must not be allowed tohave a succession of nights of undisturbed reposetill he possesses the first Horace, and the first Romanedition of Virgil. Of the latter he has theMentelin : a marvellously rare book, and whichMons. Van Prae tells him is the first.But then here are sundry gems of Fifteenerswhich do not exactly class with Theology or withand Co., for the exclusive reading and meditation (according to report)of the senior partner in that gigantic firm.Among the late Mr. Hebe's letters, are several from ProfessorHaulthall, or Hanthall, the celebrated Horatian. The correspondencebetween these two scholars was in the Latin tongue. Amongthe letters of the former, is one in which express mention is madeof the Loss COLLECTION thus: " Klossiana [Bibliotheca] tot cttanta continent, ut prius consilium tuum cognoscere velle, quuro singulaacquirement.

Let us draw a few out of their lurking-holes.Here is a CAXTON, the Life of St. Catherineof Sends, the Roxburgh copy ; the Dante of1477; the Decor Puellarum\ Etymological Grcecumof 1499 ; and Ptolemy, 1482, upon vellum ; andTerentianus Taurus of 1497- Of a later period,and in diverse departments, receive the following.The six first folios of Erasmus' Greek Testament,and four first folios of Shakspeare : the first Eustathiusupon Homer ; the Irish Grammar of 17^8 ;Louvain, 12mo., of which only two other copies areknown in England ; Reuchlin's Hebrew Grammar,with his own MS. notes,. 1506, folio. Then again,if any body talks of challenging my friend on thescore of broadside curiosities, he very quietly andsignificantly points to the Original Challenge of theAdmirable Briton, printed by Zileti in 1580, andaffixed to the doors of the church of St. John andSt. Paul, at Rome ; to which the modern Challengerno sooner directs his attention, than he apologisesfor his temerity, and acknowledges the panoply ofthe Archdeacon.But the day is wearing away, and where are theDEAR Lines? "I purse, sequar te;" and Dr.Butler leads me half over his house in pointing tothem, in all forms and conditions.

To drop metaphor. If Dr. Butler have notthe finest Collection of Lines in regard to vellumsand large papers he has certainly the largestand most complete ; but I am both forward andfearless to say, that, in many instances, this Aldinepassion is carried to extravagant, and to me unintelligible,limits. I cannot comprehend why forgeriesare to be mixed up with genuine commodities.1 cannot comprehend why the authors of such basestuff are to sit down upon the same bench with theoriginal manufacturers. Would you, knowingly,travel one post in the same chaise with a notoriousforger ? And yet, my excellent friend, the ArchonsSKETCHES OF [Arehdwtemdeacon, stuffs the pockets and seats of his own carriagewith a very host of Lioness Counterfeits !Again.

Away, then, for the Books themselves! But the w r work of Renard can alone beour guide as here is occular demonstration of thetruisms of his text. I must of necessity be comparativelybrief. First for the Fifteeners ; but letus make our passing reverence to the productions ofthe press, of this period, which were manufacturedin the office of Andrews Torrents, the father-in-lawof Aldus.

He is not less true to the principlesof his church than of his constitution ; of that constitution,framed according to the wisdom of thosewho worked the Revolution of 1688, through all itsshifting varieties, to a steady and triumphant close.As the Head Master of a Public School, his celebrityis decidedly .

Itis so small as to be very little more than four inchesin height, by three and four only in width ; but it ispregnant with rich and striking specimens of theart of the time. Its late owner has, I think, overratedits graphic skill. The arrangement or dU-positionof its ornaments appears to me to be its more- ntial merit. The larger heads of Christ andthe Virgin are in the usual meagre style of theday, and decidedly ut' Hcmish art. As to the juv-970 SKETCHES OF IS ir John Tobin.sued likeness or portrait of Mary of Burgundy, inone of the three females St. Catherine, St. Barbara,and Mary Magdalene I cannot bring myself to giveany credence of it. It is clear that the larger headof the Virgin, on the reverse of folio 287, is takenfrom the same original (though more matured in theexpression) as that of the three preceding. Thecleverest, for brilliancy of execution, is that of thesmaller head of the Virgin, folio 288, rect. Thechief attraction and worth of this splendidly executedlittle book, consists in the extreme and unusual perfectionof its condition. This little gem was notprocured under the sum of one hundred guineas.Long may its owner, now a septuagenarian, run thiscareer of elegant and intellectual pursuit.
