And to Mr. Griffith, the intelligentRecord Searcher, the greatest obligation is due, forPREFACE.repeated assistance and extensive communication ofcharters and records, many of which are includedin this work ; as well as some of the collection ofthe early cases, by Mr. Hillock, of the ChanceryBar.The unrestrained liberality with which the recordsof the Tower were opened for inspection, bythe orders of Mr. Petrie, as well as the aid soreadily afforded in referring to them, by Mr. Bailey,Mr. Hardy, and Mr. Sharpe, require the warmestacknowledgments.A similar liberality was exhibited by Mr. Leach,with respect to the records at the Rolls Chapel ;and the most prompt and unwearied assistance wasalso experienced there from Mr. Palmer, togetherwith the use of his accurate and complete i indexes.The access to the valuable and extensive contentsof the British Museum, was much facilitated bythe extensive information and practical knowledgeof Sir Henry Ellis ; and Sir Frederic Madden wasalso kind enough to aid our researches.To Mr. Dawson Turner we are indebted for thecommunication of the important leet rolls of Yarmouth; which, besides their intrinsic value, are tobe additionally prized, because so few records ofPREFACE.that description, and of so early a date, are to bemet with in any of the boroughs ; and to Mr. goading,of Southward, we are obliged for the use ofthe documents relative to that place.To Mr. Hudson Gurney our thanks are due, forthe kind communication of the laborious collection,by Mr. Daniel Gummy, of extracts from theborough books of lynn.For charters and records, relating to Ireland, wehave derived considerable assistance from Mr.Lynch, barrister at law; and for those of Cork,from Mr. Robert Travers.To Lord Gainsborough we have to make the sameacknowledgments, for the loan of an invaluable collectionof autograph letters of the time of QueenElizabeth, relative to the interesting affairs of Ireland.The very valuable Southwest Manuscripts are inthe possession of Mr. Thorpe, who kindly permittedany extracts to be made from them ; and Mr. Cochrangranted the same indulgence as to that portionin his possession.Nor should we omit the communications whichhave been received from Mr. Croton Croaker,who allowed the inspection of his extensive manuscripts.PREFACE.Notwithstanding these numerous channels of information,and the ready assistance which has beenobtained in so many directions, still it is impossible,in a work of this extent and variety, dependingupon individual research, to avoid many, andperhaps great errors.If such exist, they will no doubt be readily discoveredby those acquainted with the differentplaces to which they refer. If pointed out withcandour, they will be gratefully acknowledged:nor will their correction be less useful, if exposedfrom other motives.Considering however the object of this undertaking,less anxiety is entertained respecting errorsin detail, or on minor points, not affecting thegeneral principles.The result of the whole compilation has beenthe chief object in view ; with respect to which,neither doubt nor alarm are professed to beentertained.February, 1836.CONTENTS OF VOL.

Tolessen the distaste of the former, and direct the course ofthe latter, is the intention of this undertaking.Notwithstanding the necessary tediousness of compilations,it will not be desirable to state the substance onlyrfthe authorities quoted. Where speculation is so tempts,but so unsatisfactory, care should be taken to avoidwe adoption of theories instead of facts. It is proposedVOL. 1. bii INTRODUCTION.therefore to extract whatever is found material : to give thewords of the records, documents, or authors to whichreference is made, adding such observations as may appearto be requisite.But that the reader, who is disinclined to wade consecutivelythrough all the authorities, may readily refer tothe places or periods which are the more immediate objectof his research, me Index will supply a reference to theformer. With a view to the latter, a chronological divisionhas been adopted, in order to make each succeeding documenta practical exposition of the preceding ; — to simplifythe arrangement— and to exhibit more clearly the progressivedevelopment of the general result.Authentic documents, therefore, containing the real historyof the Municipal Institutions of these kingdoms, willbe produced, in order to afford a distinct view of thesuccessive changes which have occurred ; and of the timeand manner in which we have departed from the institutionsof our ancestors: that it may be known what wasthe original constitution of those bodies before we ventureupon the important question of their reform.To confirm the statements made — ^by actual documentsupon which they are founded — and to afford those, whowill undertake the task, the opportunity of satisfactorilypursuing the inquiry, and of judging for themselves, arethe objects of the Compilation. To point out the result,in an intelligible form to the general reader, is the intentionof the Introduction.The real nature of the English constitution, particularlyof those parts which relate to the municipal institutionsand the elective franchise, cannot but be a subject ofinterest at the present moment, when some changes havealready been made, and others are contemplated.Introduction. iiiIt has generally, but too hastily, been assumed, that theearly history o f our constitution is involved in such doubt,that it is impossible to trace its original nature. It is withmore truth asserted, that in pater periods the tis ages of theconstitution have been involved in such intricacy, as torender i t difficult to unravel the perplexing maze.The correctness of the first proposition is disputed : —and for its refutation, the reader is referred to the body ofthis work. The second is unfortunately too well founded.For when, with reference to our municipal institutions, weconsider the confusion which has arisen, in modem times,between boroughs and corporations — burgesses and freemen— the rights by birth — service — and redemption, withreference to corporate — parliamentary — and trading privileges— together with the perplexity resulting from theburgage tenure — corporate — and scot and lot rights ofburgess-ship — it must be admitted that the apparent difficultyis formidable. — It may be hoped that it is not insurmountable; and that a practical remedy may be suggested inthe restoration of the constitution purified from its abuses.A sketch of the history of boroughs was some years sincesubmitted to the public ; followed by a practical illustrationin the report of the West Looe case : and subsequentlyby a smaller publication referring to the same subject.*It may be thought too remote to commence the presenthistory from the Saxon times : — but in that period ourA Sketch of the History of Boroughs and of the Corporate right of Election;in a Letter to Lord John Russell, on Practical Parliamentary Reform.

These form, inthemselves, an important feature in this undertaking ; andassume an interesting character from the time in whichthey were granted, and from the nature of the grants.They are arranged chronologically — the only mode bywhich the several kings can now be represented as speakingthe language they really intended to use ; and by that meanstheir grants are explained and illustrated by the light whichthey throw upon each other.Extracts are also given from the legal documents ofthis period, which tend to illustrate the general subject,particularly from our ancient statutes and law authorities ;with charters in each reign to establish the occasionalchanges in the nature, language, objects, and effects,of those grants of the crown.The inferences drawn from these documents, and affirmedwith confidence, are —INTRODUCTION v1st That boroughs existed in this country from theearnest periods of our authentic history; and that althoughall boroughs were not cities, all cities were borough s^ andhad their municipal rights in that character alone2nd. That they were all essentially alike in their object,constitution, and general character — as well in England asin Wales, Scotland, and Ireland.3rd. That the same class of persons originally formedthe body of burgesses in all boroughs.4th. That this class has never been directly changedfnm the earliest time to the present moment.5th. That the burgesses were the permanent free inhabitantsof the boroughs; performing their duties andenjoying their privileges — as the free inhabitant paying scot and bearing lot ; presented sworn , andenrolled at the court leet.6th. That they had no other character till the reign ofHenry VI. : — when theist charter of municipal incorporationwas granted ; which superinduced upon the originalcharacter of burgesses — that of corporators also : — for thepurpose of giving them the power of takings and inheritinglands by succession : — ^and of suing and being sued by theircorporate name. But the class qf persons continued still thesame.7th. That the power of selecting the burgesses, nowexercised by the corporations or their select bodies ; bywhich, in some places, the numbers are reduced to thesmallest — and in others, increased to an equally improperamount ; is a manifest usurpation ; and only supported bymodem decisions.8th. That nan-resident burgesses were first introduced indirectdefiance of the parliamentary writ, and the statutes» Co. List. 109 a.^vi INTRODUCTION.of the realm, in the instances of the persons elected asrepresentatives : and afterwards extended by usurpation tothe electors : particularly on the restoration of Charles II. ;when, under the statute of the 13th year of that reign, theresident corporators were expelled from their offices bythe king's commissions ; and the great officers of state, andother persons, were introduced in their stead : — anothermanifest encroachment upon the ancient simplicity of theseinstitutions.9th. That although these usurpations were in someplaces corrected . after the Restoration, yet in others theywere improperly continued, and were subsequently . sanctionedby legal authority.10th. That the result of supporting these usurpations, andthe various usages which in different places have sprungout of them, has produced an anomalous, complicated, andunintelligible system, which has given birth to a distinctbranch of the law, relative to corporations — more intricateand mysterious than any other ; not known by those whoact under it — altogether hid from the unlearned — ^and butpartially revealed to the learned.11th. That nothing can restore these municipal institutionsto a reasonable and practical form, but re-establishingthe ancient uniformity of their rights and privileges : bywhich means they may be equally known and understoodby all classes ; and any abuse, or departure from the generalprinciple, would be instantly corrected by the influence ofpublic opinion, or by uniform judicial determinations.Such are the practical conclusions deducible from thedocuments here collected.Theorists may suggest fanciful speculations, which how-introduction.viiever plausible, yet wanting the confirmation of experience,cannot be adopted with confidence; and the Legislature,in the exercise of its comprehensive wisdom, must hesitatebefore it sanctions them.The means of arriving at a correct judgment, are herelaid before the public: and it may be added, for theFIRST TIME. — For, notwithstanding the number and varietyof authors who have approached this subject, it maywith, truth be said, that none have traced the history ofour municipal institutions from their origin to the presentperiod.This attempt is not founded on ignorance of the fact,that our best writers are much divided upon the importantpoints of this inquiry. It is not however proposedto discuss their disagreement with each other, orto endeavour to reconcile their differences. If through thedark labyrinths of antiquity, a way may haply be foundwith any tolerable degree of certainty, little solicitude willbe entertained about the wanderings and errors of themany who have before attempted the same road ; and asthere is no hypothesis to be maintained — no object to beserved — ^no party to be flattered — ^and no other end in thisresearch than the desire of finding out and vindicating thetruth ; — it is possible the right path may be discovered moreeasily, than by those, whose greater abilities were divertedfrom it by some wrong bias ; although amongst them shouldbe included the names of Sir Edward Coke, Prynne, Petit,Tyrrel, and Willis. But the success of the attempt mustbe submitted to the judgment of the candid and intelligentreader. It may be considered an indiscreet vanity tosuppose that any thing can be added to the works of thoselaborious authors. At the same time it should be remembered,that many of them wrote with controversial views,viii INTRODUCTION.and subject to the prevailing prejudices of their day ; whichtended to distract their attention from the proper bearingsof the subject; and to warp their judgments. Othersapplied themselves only to partial views of the question ;and some, not having the means of correcting the errorswhich had been adopted by their predecessors, from necessitycontented themselves with blindly following them.Besides, the numerous public records now so readily accessibleto all — and many of which have been made public forthe general use — were at that time either lying togetherin confused heaps, or, if partially arranged, were accessibleonly to a few ; and those indisposed to make the proper useof them, or inclined to pervert and misrepresent them.Thus, Brady ^ who was Keeper of the Records at theTower, has in his work on Boroughs, written with a particulardesign, mistake many of the documents he cited :yet as they were in his own keeping, he had the readymeans of preventing any inaccuracies, had he been desirousof doing it.Tyrrel his opponent, had not access to the documentsquoted by Brady, nor the means of correcting his errors incitingthem. He could only attack the reasoning, assumingthe records to be accurate. Thus Brady kept the fieldwithout a competitor; and by his misrepresentations obtainedfor his work the success he desiredThere is no doubt that boroughs existed during theSaron period; and also a class of persons called burgesses;many of both being expressly recorded in Domesday.^ Gilbert Stuart, ki his View of Society in Europe, says, that "Dr. Brady wasthe slave of a faction ;** and that " Hume, struck with his talents, and deceivedby his ability, founded his history on Brady's tenets." — p. 339.INTRODUCTION ixThe Saxon laws exhibit the great personal division ofsociety into the bond and free : ^ the freemen being mentionedthroughout these laws, as contradistinguish^';fromlilt villains. ,. j;v*The *^ liber homo' or ^^ freeman has therewith existed inthis country, from the commencement of our institutions :and the term has also continued in use to the present day ;although it has been perverted from its original signification,and has thus been productive of much error.As to the local division of the country, the essential distinctionwas between shires and boroughs : the former beingsubdivided into hundreds — tythings — lathes — and wakens; * the latter, where their extent rendered it necessary,into wards. 'The Saxon laws refer both to these personal and localdistinctions.As to the former the ^^ freemen'' were distinguished fromthe " foreigners" or " strangers"* and the " servi" or villains.The lords were answerable for the conduct of the last : —the freemen for themselves. They were prohibited fromvagrancy — ^and all their dealings were to be transacted inthe town before the king's officer — they were restrainedto a fixed residence : and were bound by oaths and pledges(borghs)^ to keep the king's peace and to obey the law.The householder was the person responsible for the dueregulation of his house, and the conduct of his guests oriimutes.^Our law from the earliest period favoured the freedomof the subject : and therefore the various codes of the Saxon> p. 41—56.

One of them — service for seven years,will require hereafter particular notice. So marked wasthe distinction between those of free and servile condition,that prohibitions, enforced by fines, were directedagainst the harbouring of fugitive villains.The local divisions of shires and boroughs* had their presidingofficers, and separate jurisdictions.* The alderman, atfirst, was the presiding officer in both ; * but subsequentlythe more specific names were applied to the king's officer ineach — of shire reeve for the county — and portreeve^ for theborough.The pledges of the freemen were given— their oaths ofallegiance taken — ^and their public duties and the local governmentregulated — in the folcmote :• which, in after times,was in the counties called the shiregemote or sheriffstom "^ — and in boroughs, the burgh mote or court leet of theboroughsIn those courts, from which we have derived our systemof Trial by Jury, persons were sworn * to make the necessarypublic inquiries, and to decide disputed facts'Another important point established by these laws is, thatevery freeman, in order to be law-worthy — ^by taking uponhimself the burdens and responsibilities of the law,^® andby those means entitling himself to its privileges — wasbound to submit himself to the jurisdiction of the hundred,decenna, or borough ; and if, after twelve years of age, heneglected to do it, he was subject to punishment for hisdefault.

For, in fact, theprovisions and spirit of the Saxon system of policy stillcontinued to prevail.The two leading records which will establish this position,are the laws compiled and published by William theConqueror; and the great fiscal record of Domesday Book.In the former, the same features are discoverable as inthe Saxon laws. The king's peace' is to be preserved —the freemen are to be sworn to their allegiance — the paymentof scot and lot is mentioned — and the watch andward ^ in boroughs is enforced : — the provisions for sellingin the presence of witnesses are repeated ; as well as thegeneral system of giving pledges The first trace also is tobe found of the law subsequently so distinctly stated in Glanville,'that " all bondmen who remained without claim forayear and a day in any borough, &c., should be free."P. 60, 68.

Many of those boroughs are entered distinctly bythemselves, before the terra regis, and the general return forthe county : and this is an early confirmation that the boroughswere separate and distinct from the counties,' and that theprincipal characteristic of a borough was its separate jurisdiction,* — partly exclusive of the sheriff's interference.The reeves of the boroughs are spoken of, as well as theshire-reeves.*There are entries in Domesday y in almost every county,which establish that burgess-ship did not depend upontenure : • because many burgesses are described as belongingto other manors If tenure was the basis of their right,they would have belonged altogether to the manors, andwould not be described as burgesses of the boroughs,because they did not hold of them.But if residence made them burgesses, then the entry isexplained, reconcilable with the facts : because they would,in respect of their resiancy, be burgesses in the place oftheir residence; but would be entered under the manors ofwhich their lands were held.There are also numerous instances in which the burgessesbeing distinctly connected with their houses, and the latter» P. 68.

They paid thecustom of gable for their houses, and other taxes.' In theentry as to Canterbury,* 14 burgesses are mentioned insteadof their houses ; and in Thetford, Norwich, and other places,the identity cannot be mistaken.It is also clear, from many passages that all the householderswere not burgesses. Peers, ecclesiastics, minors,females, villains, and persons of infamous character wereexcepted from the privileges, and also exempted from theduties of burgess-ship : — many houses are therefore mentionedin the returns which had not burgessesThose only who bore their share of the burdens of theplace — or, according to the laws of the Saxons, andWilliam the Conqueror's paid scot and bore lot — wereentitled to the privileges ; those who from poverty or othercause did not pay the charges, or serve the public offices ofthe borough, being excluded.It would have been inconsistent with the whole system ofthe law at that time, if non-residents could have been burgesses; and therefore we find, throughout this document,that the burgesses were resident — and in that respect distinguishedfrom the members of the merchant guilds , ® and ofthe trading companies, who might be non-resident. It isfrom this latter practice, that the modem abuse of nonresidentburgesses has been in a great degree introduced, orrather maintained.Inhabitants " are only once mentioned in Domesday, inthe return of Hereford.

And the merchantguilds and their members, were also distinct from themunicipal jurisdiction of the town — from the borough rights .^and the burgesses.The system of pledges derived from the Saxon law,and continued for centuries afterwards, is expressly recognizedin Domesday.With reference to the privileges generally enjoyed byboroughs it should be observed, that throughout this recordthey appear to be claimed and exercised by the ^^ burgesses''only — and no other class of persons is specified as entitledto them.

The other names subsequentlyintroduced of " freemen," " commonalty," " commons,"inhabitants," " honorary freemen," " potwallers," &c —are innovations — capable, it is true, of being explained,and reconciled with the ancient laws and customs in themanner attempted in this work ; but capable also of beingmisapplied, as they have been, in a manner inconsistentwith the ancient law. And this has introduced the confusionso much to be deplored.After a careful investigation of this invaluable record, notrace can be found in it of any municipal corporation existingat the time of its compilation ; although ecclesiasticalcorporations are mentioned. The negative inference thereforeagainst the existence of the former at that period, isall but conclusive. And as with respect to some particularboroughs the survey is expressly to the point ; so likewisethe general conclusion from the whole is, that in all the boroughsthe burgesses were the inhabitant householders.During the reign of William 11.^ no municipal grants,nor changes in the municipal institutions appear to havebeen made.Henry I. ordained fresh codes of laws, but they differedfrom the preceding merely in form, and in slight variations oflanguage.

As theScotch law was, like the English, precise in defining thefixed residence of every person ; so was it directed, like theEnglish, against vagrancy and the harbouring of strangers?The charters of Scotland have also the same local character: and from the " leges burgorum" of David I., and theWelsh and Irish charters, it appears that the burgagein boroughs were held in Scotland, * Wales, and Ireland *by burgage tenure. The " burgesses" or " indwellers" areexpressly distinguished from those persons who lived outof the boroughs in the counties at large, who are characterisedby the name of " upland-men'' and " lands-warden''It being distinctly stated that,* " if a husbandman, dwellingwithout the burgh, had a burgage within it, he 'should notbe esteemed a burgess, but only in that burgh in whichhe had the burgage." In another part of the samelaws the houses of the burgesses are mentioned ^ nearly inthe same manner as those of England are in Domesday ;the burgesses appearing also to be the householders. And thejurisdiction of the hugh courts is contradistinguished fromthat of the king's general courts.From the charters in the reign of Henry II., the samedirect inference is also to be drawn, that the privileges ofthe different burghs in England, Scotland, Ireland, andWales, were in substance alike,* and to be enjoyed only^ P. 317.

But all whoresided were entitled to the privileges, if they were notwithin the exceptions before mentioned,* and were of Freecondition and householders ; and, as a necessary consequence,paid scot and bore lot ; and were sworn and enrolled at thecourt leet of the boroughsThe charters of this period also gave that privilegewhich was the distinguishing characteristic of a borough —namely — that it should be exempt from the interference ofthe sheriff. The burgesses therefore, had the return of allwrits ;^zxidL were, in the language of those times, "to bequit of suits of shires and hundreds;'"^ as a necessary resultof which exemption, they were required to give their pledgesin their own courts, and were liable to be amerced if theydid not provide them.All that is contained in the earlier Saxon laws — in thoseof William I. — Henry I. — and the charters of those periodsis confirmed, and in a great degree repeated, in thecompilation of the law which passes under the name ofGlanville;"^ the Chief Justiciary of England. And thesame observation may be made with respect to Britton-^ —Bracton — Fleta— and the Mirror — the text authors of thegreatest authority in our law : and by which the correctnessof the positions previously laid down may be properly tried.The right to freedom by birth, may be distinctly tracedthrough all these authors, as unquestionably a part of ourearly English law, and the necessary result of the doctrineof villainage. The rights by marriage — service — andemancipation — are also all explained by the nature of therelative positions of the lord and villain.P. 373, 409, 454, 458, 483, 503, 583, 618.P. 427, 435, 454, 476, 482, 618.P. 447, 478, 494, 555. • R 341.^ P. 336, 338, 369, 372.P. 437, 467, 490, 523, 587-P. 345.INTRODUCTION. xsxThe law as to freedom by residence is repeated inGlanville ;^ where it is said, that " if any native bondsman'^ shall have dwelt quietly — that is without claim — for ayear and a day in any privileged town, away from hislord so that he shall be in their community — to wit, the"gtdld — he shall by that act be emancipated from vil-manage."And the same principle in substance, is to befound, in the Regiamm Majestatem — the Leges Burgorum —Bracton, Fleta, and the Mirror.The few charters in the reign of Richard /., have inView the same object as those of former reigns ; as wellas the more numerous grants of the time of King John.All have the same tendency ; giving the boroughs the generalprivileges of ex clusi ve jurisdictions and exemptions, whichcould not be enjoyed by any but residentsThe important conclusion to be drawn from these charters,which destroys every argument for the modem abuses —is, t hat down to this per io d— thin the time of legal memory / ^^^there were not any municipal corporations. \/Without some explanation, the importance of this factmay not at first sight be apparent to the general reader.The great abuse in c corporations has arisen from theassumed power of capriciously ad sitting into their bodywhom they thought fit ; by which means, large num hers ofho notary freemen have from time to time been made burgesses,who, in effect, either directly or indirectly, controlor neutralize the rights oF the inhabitants! -— — -The only pretence upon which the burgesses of a boroughcould exercise a discretion in admitting any personinto their liberties, was founded upon the fact of hisintending to come, or actually coming, to reside within the» p. 350.

I L a I " ' ■■■■*. Illand means. Such a discretion was originally exercised inthis country under the common law : the corporationsendeavoured to carry it further, by assuming to themselvesthe right of arbitrarily determining who should belong totheir body; — what inhabitants should be admitted— whoshould be rejected — and what non-residents should bereceived. The courts of l ^w^ ^,pd rn^riTnittpfis of theHousgof CommonS j , have too readily supported this assumption ofpo wer on the ground of prescription.The right of making burgesses was likewise claimedby the select bodies of the corporations, under the nameof the " commo n councils ;'' to the exclusion of any interferenceby the burgesses at large. That claim was alsoasserted upon the same ground of prescription : — o r in otherwords, upon the presumption that such a right had existedfrom before the time of legal memory ; which for this, andother purposes, is fixed by statute at the reign of Richard I.I If therefore it can be proved that, in fact corporationsdid not exist till long after the reign of Richard /.,• it isclear that the right of arbitrarily making burgesses, and theexclusive power of the common councils, as far as they arefounded upon prescription would be negatived ; losingthe only ground upon which any attempt can be made tosupport them.As the exercise of these powers has undoubtedly producedthe greatest abuses — and, by placing all the privilegesof the boroughs under the power of a few — has keptalive the most injurious suspicions and jealousies — itbecomes of the greatest importance to ascertain whetherthey are founded upon prescription or not.INTRODUCTION. xxiThe c charters, to the close of the reign of King John, decidethat point incontestably.They are numerous — applicable to all parts of the all varieties of language, and an apparent varietyof privileges But in none of them is there a ny mention ofa corporation. Nor any term from which the existence ofany municipal corporate body can be inferred. On thecontrary, the privileges are given expressly to the burgessesand their heir to hold hei^editarily (" hereditary") : and asthe great distinction in principle, with respect to corporations,is, that they hold by succession, and not by inheritanc^j this fact ought to be decisive of the point. It shouldalso be remarked, that the word ^^ successors'' does notoccur at this time with respect to any municipal corporation: though it does in many grants to and by ecclesiasticalcorporations ; who are contradistinguished from the municipalaggregate bodies of burgesses and others.If therefore there is any fact which can be historicallyproved, and relied upon with certainty — and for which werefer with confidence to the documents in the body of thework — it is — ^that there were no municipal corporations atthe period of which we are speaking; and consequentlythere can be no prescriptive right in corporations to makebur^re sees arbitrarily; nor for the exercise of that power ^by the common councils. But the burgesses were thereinhabitant householders, who in consequence of their standingin that position by the common law, paid scot and borelot, and were sworn and enrolled at the court leet.p. 422.P. 296, 309, 316, 335, 355, 360, 361, 363, 364, 367—370, 372, 376, 383,389—391, 403, 404, 406—412, 414, 415, 417—419, 422, 438, 439-P. 489.INTRODUCTION.The subsequent history points out the manner in-vrhichthe gradual usurpations were superinduced upon thissimple origin; and how the creation and confirmation, ofmunicipal corporations were progressively effected.The great charter of liberties was confirmed by Henry III.to the freemen of the realm : and all the liberties and freecustoms were secured to London, and other cities, boroughs,and towns in England and Ireland ; and to the barons ofthe five ports.*The sheriff's turn and the view of frankpledge were directedto be duly kept, as had been accustomed, for theproper preservation of the king's peace.' In the samecharter the first provisions are also introduced to restrainalienations to ecclesiastical bodies; which taking by succession,— and consequently holding in perpetuity — preventedall future profits to the lord : they were, thereforecalled the dead or unprofitable hand, and the grants weretermed alienations in mortmain/ . The first instance of the adoption of the term " successors**^^^CMfi/l^in a grant to a municipal body, occurs in 1227, the 12th of/ Henry III. in a charter to the city of London, giving thecitizens free warren at Staines. It is there used, as inmany other places, in conjunction with " heirs ;"* and it isvery questionable, whether it is not even then applied tothe ecclesiastical bodies mentioned in the beginning of thecharter — the archbishops — abbots — and priors.It seems highly improbable that it should refer to the,, * citizens ; because the same king, by a subsequent charter,•fiA*^ -^ in 1265, in the 50th year of his reign, after a seizure ofthe liberties of London, restored them to the citizens and> p. 423.

And in I2689 he granted another charter inasimilar form, to London, and other placesAt the same period the word " commonalty "* was frequentlyintroduced ; which in modem times, upon theauthors of Dr. Brady, has been supposed to imply a corporation; but numerous are the authorities, through manysucceeding reigns, to show, that the term has not that restrictedapplication, but is one of the most general import.Common seals also then came into frequent use, but their[option is no proof of a corporation ; for there are precedentsand. authorities to show, that in fact they were, andlegally might be, used by places not incorporated.'During the whole of the reigns of our earliest kings,there can be no doubt that the sheriff's turn in the hundreds— ^and the courts leet and view of frankpledge in theboroughs — were constantly held. They are repeatedly mentionedin the Saxon laws — the early codes of William I.* —Henry I. — Henry XL — in the Great Charter and the confirmationsof it : — in the statutes — and page by page inBritton, Bracton, and the Mirror. Nor can there be anydoubt that at those courts all the resiants or householderscapable of paying scot and bearing hty in the counties atlarge, and in the boroughs, were presented by the jurjf^gave their pledges, and were sworn and enrolled; and thatan inhabitant householder of a borough, so circumstanced,was a " burgessesIt is also equally clear, that no fact is found to establishthe existence of any municipal corporation before 1297,the 26th of Edward I. — the time when burgesses first satein Parliament, under writs requiring " two burgesses to beP. 444, 445, 447, 459—467, 471, 474, 475, and see 481, 486, 511, 524, 628,529, 548, 593, 674, 789, 799, 824, and see 832, 852, 946, 960, 1060, 1085, 1220,1254, 1520.P. 440, 451. * P. 443, 444. * P. 28.xxiv INTRODUCTION.returned from each borough " by the " burgesses."^ On thecontrary, all the laws, charters, and statutes, afford thestrongest inference, that none existed.It is therefore clear, that the class of persons ivho, in1297, were called upon as burgesses to return members toParliament, were not corporators : but the inhabitant householders^presented pledged stvom^ and enrolled — and thisuniversally in all boroughs ;^ for they were all substantiallyalike — ^their charters essentially the same — one law wasapplicable to all — and one form of writs and preceptsdirected to every borough.That the reader may be enabled to apply these observationsto the several boroughs ; and also to the documents inthe subsequent part of this work ; a list is afterwards givenof those which sent burgesses to Parliament, in the 26th ofEdward I. : for the purpose of showing what places wereat that time treated as boroughs.The parliamentary right of election, which has beenalready settled by the Legislature, is not the subject of thisinquiry ; but it will be material from time to time to referto those classes of persons who, under the old system, wereallowed to vote in parliamentary elections as burgesses, becauseit will be one mode of showing who they really were;and what palpable abuses were occasionally allowed andsanctioned.The term " successors'' which appeared once before in acharter to London, of the reign of Henry I., again occurs in1283, the 12th of Edward III., in a document relative toBeverley ; where it is coupled with the term " heirs," andis applied to the burgesses. But Beverley had formerlybeen an ecclesiastical establishment.P. 29.INTRODUCTION.In the next year it is used again by itself, with referenceto the commonalty of Nottingham in a charter to that place.But although it appeared in the charters to LondonBeverley, Nottingham, and some few other places, still itwas by no means generally adopted in this reign : and it isimpossible to assume that any change was effected, ortended, in the class or condition of burgesses, by theadoption of this expression. For a subsequent charter toLotulott, was granted to the citizens, and their heir only :and another to the burgesses of Hull and their heirs,although their successors were also mentioned in anotherpart of the charter.In the text-book, which is commonly called Fleta, composedin the reign of Edward I., the perpetual successionof the ecclesiastical' bodies of colleges and chapters, isexpressly recognized : but there is no application of thatdoctrine to the aggregate municipal bodies of " burgesses'In the law cases of the reign of Edward II., reported inthe Year Books, notwithstanding the commonalty of Lynn,*in Norfolk, is mentioned as an aggregate body, and itsrights and duties in that respect were discussed, nothing issaid of its being a corporation. Nor was the corporatedoctrine, even as applicable to ecclesiastical bodies, wellunderstood at the time, as appears from a case in the Year-booksthough another authority shows that the notionof the naturally continued succession of the municipal bodiesof the inhabitants or burgesses of boroughs, was fully recognizedin the manner asserted by Lord Coke ; who saysthat although an ancient grant to a body not incorporatewould be good ; yet otherwise it is of such a grant at thisday.*P. 546, 552. 2 P. 664.

And if that class isclearly defined, with respect to so important a place as themetropolis, it would be difficult to avoid the conclusionthat the same description would be applicable to otherplaces: particularly after the perusal of the abundantevidence which will be adduced to show, that all theboroughs were in substance the same; and also the particularreference in many charters to the privileges ofLondon.The " citizens'' are in this case described to be " thosewho were born and heritable in the same city by descent ofinheritance; or who were resiants, and taxable to scotand lot" The latter is the most general description ; andas the former would include all who had heritable houses,so would the latter include all other householders recantwho were of free condition.Thus it will be seen, that all the former authorities areconfirmed by this solemn decision; and that there is noquestion, that down to this period, this was the properdescription of a citizen ; — ^that it had no reference to anycorporation; — ^nor to any fraternity, guild, or other aggregatebody, — except the inhabitant householders ; — particularlyas the case goes on expressly to say, that " the rightdid not extend to any " other persons."In a subsequent case, relative to a guild in London, itwas said that " the commonalty of London was perpetual''p. 633, 634.INTRODUCTION. xxviibut that is explained by Madox in his Firma Burghs whoargues that ^' as the inhabitants of towns would always"continue in perpetual succession, so every municipalbody was by natural succession perpetual, whethci^ incorporatedor not." And as the perpetual succession of thecommonalty is here attributed to the perpetual existenceof the city — and not to any peculiar right belonging toitas a corporate body — it must be admitted that this isanother proof, that even London was not at that timeincorporated.Again, in the reign of Henry IV., in an answer to apetition to Parliaments against the improper admission asfjwnen of London by the masters of trades, of persons notcontinually abiding in the city, it is said, that " no personought to enjoy the franchise of London if he was not aatiztn resiant and abiding within the city."^In a record relative to Southampton, in the reign ofHenry Vi,* it appears, that " living for a year and a day** in a borough, and paying scot and lot, was held to con-statutea burgess : " — the other circumstances of being ahouseholder J and being sworn and enrolled following as thegeneral qualifications required by the law.In the same reign also, it appears from the ordinancesrelative to Colchester, that the burgesses of that place werepersons " of free condition, sworn to the king and the town,householders bearing scot and lots " And the persons excludedfrom being burgesses were, " children — apprentices —law"journeymen — chamber-holders, not keeping craft, norP. 70, 638, and Mad.

Nor does the term occur but in the 4th' and6th wher e it is introduced occasionally in the margin,referring to that title in the Abridgment by Brooke. But itis not contained in the text, nor is there any reference toCorporations in either of the cases themselves.The term does not actually occur in the Year Books till1409*— 1the 1 1th of Henry IV. — when, in a case respectingthe government of the school at Gloucester, it was said, thatit would be unreasonable for the master to be preventedfrom holding his school where it pleased him, unless itwas in a case where an university was corporate, andschools founded from ancient times." The introduction ofthis term in the margin of the subsequent prints of these reportsis entirely to be attributed to the abridgment of Brooke,which was published in 1686, the 28th of Elizabeth.

All the rest — particularlythe earlier cases — prefer to ecclesiastical bodies — as abbeys —priories — chantries — societies — hospitals — masters andscholars — churchwardens — churchwardens — vicars — deansand chapters ; and other bodies of analogous descriptions,as the universities — colleges — and guilds. Those relatingto municipal ladies which describe them as corporations, aredl subsequent to the commencement of the reign of Henry VI :^—the first instance occurring in the third year of that reign —1434— in which it is asserted, that commodities are bodiespolitic. Corporations are mentioned a second time inthe Year Book of the 19th of Henry VI., 1440, the yesterafter the Hull and Plymouth charters of incorporation.*It is also a striking circumstance, that the term " corpore"is likewise introduced in the printed copies of theStatutes in the same irregular manner, in which it is firstP. 692. » P. 695. " P. 693.P' 918. * See poet. p. xzziy.XXX INTRODUCTION.placed in the margin of the Year Books. The " titles'' olthe statutes form no part of them : but, in fact, are like theentries in the margin of the law cases. The term " corporate"first occurs in the printed statutes, in the tithe of theact of 6th Richard II., statute 4, c. 9,^ which is made torefer to " towns corporate'' But it is not justified by thestatute itself, nor by the parliament roll ; for, upon inspection,the word " corporate" is not to be found upon it.A still more convincing proof, that the municipal bodieswere not before this time incorporated, or treated as corporatebodies, is this ; — that the statute of the 15th ofRichard IL* c. 6, (1391,) which, reciting the former prohibitionsagainst religious persons holding lands in perpetuity,extends that prohibition to guilds and fraternities ;and afterwards adds, that, ^' because mayors , bailiffs andcommons of cities boroughs and other towns, which havea perpetual commonalty, and others which have officesperpetual, be as perpetual as people of religion, theyshould not thenceforth purchase to them, and to theircommons or offices."From this statute it is clear, that the laws against mortmaindid not before this time apply even to guilds or fraternities: still less to mayors, bailiffs, or commons of cities,boroughs, or other towns ; and it is also obvious from the wordsof the statute, and the introduction likewise of " perpetualoffices," that it was still not as corporations that thisprovision was extended to them ; but as to bodies perpetualby natural succession, and not by any artificial notion ofa body corporate or politic. Nor are the cities, boroughs,or towns so described by this statute.In the reign of Henry Iv,' the term " Corporate" isfor the first time, introduced into a public document, appH-> P. 717, 781.

A petition, no doubt, founded upon thestatute last quoted, and the increasing development of thedoctrine of corporations as applied to ecclesiastical bodies,guilds, and fraternities : particularly as the trading companiesin London had begun at this time to assume to themselvesconsiderable powers, which had been frequently thesubject of discussion between the liverymen and the wards-men,or the inhabitant householders in the several wards.This petition was, however, unsuccessful, and, in fact,Plymouth was not incorporated till 28 years afterwardsIn the reign of Henry V., a statute defines most distinctlyw ho the burgesses w ere thro ughout the kingdom. Forthe act which requires the knights of the shires, as wellas their electors, to be resident in their respective counties,also obliges the representatives and electors for boroughsto be ^ ^ resident, dwellings and free in their borou^hs.''^ Andthough that statute has since been repealed, it may stillbe relied upon as containing a description of the personswho were the burgesses at the time it passed ; and ought tohave continued so till the present time, as they have neversince been directly changed by legal authority.It cannot fail to be remarked how entirely this descriptioncorresponds with the Saxon laws — the common law —P. 841. * P. 870, 871. 3 P. 802, 808. * P. 639.xxxii INTRODUCTION.and the municipal documents — as well as the decisionsbefore quoted relative to London. The " burgesses" wereresident'' and in that character they would be suitorsat the court leet : — they were to be " dwelling ,'' and so wouldbe householders^ and would pay scot and lot: — they were alsoto be o{ ^^free'' condition and therefore would be stood andenrolled at the court leet ; and would be free and lawful menOF the place where they were enrolled and dwelt ; and asthat was a " borough'' they would.be " burgesses''No municipal corporations were created at this time:but guilds and fraternities were;^ and obtained the characteristicpowers of corporations by express grants ofcapacity to receive lands to them and their successorsforever. Thus in 1416, Henry V., in the fourth year ofhis reign, incorporated a fraternity or hospital near Lawford'sGate, in the suburb of Bristol; and declared that thefraternity should be persons capable of receiving land andtenements to the guardian and his successors for ever : and toplead, and be impleaded : and have a common seal : withpower to make bye-laws. Which appears to be the firsttime in which these powers are given in such words.* Butthey were repeated in the next year, in a grant to the guildof St. George of Norwich. And it was not till a far distantperiod that the cities of Bristol and Norwich weresubsequently incorporated.In the reign of Henry V L^^ the reforming g^ statutes passed'*7 fo r the replication of the choose sj)f knights of the shire :7 by which " to remedy the great evils arising from theN " elections being made by outrageous and excessive numb^^ ber of people dwelling in the counties, most part of small" substance, pretending to have a voice equivalent with the> p. 824. * P. 825. » p. 836.See statute 8 Henry VI., chap. 7 ; 10 Henry VI., chap. 2.INTRODUCTION. xxxiimost worthy knights and esquires, dwelling within thecounties :" the elections were directed to be made " bypeople resident and dwelling in the counties, having freeland to the value of 40^. a year." From which it may ^be inferred, that the election s for counties before that timewere made by tfae free i inhabitant householders who did suitin the sheriff 's tom ; as the el actions for born ugh were bythe sa me class of persons doing suit at the court leet of theborough. This is the most reasonable inference ; because,as there is no special provision of the law either way, thegeneral law would be supposed to have prevailed in both ; bywhich means they would have been on the same footing : differingonly in this respect, that while the one was confined tothe borough, the other extended over the whole county.However, it is in this reign the municipal corporationswere first introduced. " Commodities corporate," arementioned in a statute of the eighth of Henry VI. 1429,chap. 27.* And in the tenth of Henry VI., 1431, chap. 6,the guilds, fraternities, and companies, are referred toas incorporated.In the eighteenth year of Henry VI., 1439, the erstcharter of incorporation to a municipal body was grantedto Kingston-upon-HtULBefore that time the usual words of incorporation hadbut rarely been applied even to colleges, guilds, or fraternities; they had occasionally been introduced in the marginof the Year Books and statutes ; once in the margin of thePatent Rolls; and several times in the indexes of thosedocuments ; the compilers of them being led by the modemnotions upon this head into the belief that the documentsthey recorded were charters of incorporation.But it was not until^27 years afterwards, in the sixth^ P. 837.VOL. I. dxxxiv INTRODUCTION.of Edward IV., 1466/ that the doctrine was laid down,that the existence of corporations might be inferred from thenature of the grant, without words of incorporation ; andeven at that time the doctrine was much qualified, simplyestablishing, that ^' a grant to burgesses, for which theywere to render a rent, made them for that purpose onlya corporation, as long as the rent remained." A determinationwhich appears to have been founded upon thenecessity of supporting the king's title to the rent, when theburgesses had enjoyed the privileges in consideration ofwhich it was to be paid. The Courts therefore ruled, thatrather than the king should lose his rent altogether, and theburgesses protect their own defaults by so fraudulent anobjection, they should be held for that purpose, and asagainst themselves, to be incorporated : — undoubtedly anequitable, if not a legal determination, to that extent, andunder those limits. But carried further, so ass to drawthe inference generally of a corporation from such grants,and for the purposes of supporting the claims of the burgesses,as against the other inhabitants of the borough,or against the public ; the determination would be most unreasonableand unjust. The doctrine, even as it is statedabove, seems to be open to the objection, that it supposes aborough to be incorporated by implication, as long as therent lasts, and to cease with the rent : a position verydifficult to apply in practice.The charter of incorporation to Fully of the 18th ofHenry Vi,* differs altogether in its language, and provisionsas to the corporate powers, from any municipal charter\\ before granted. Some in the ancient form appear previouslyon the same Roll of this reign'* and they containno words of incorporation. Neither does a charter of» P. 853. * p. 857. 3 p. 859.!lIINTRODUCTION.animation to Hull ten years before ; nor a petition fromthai place for a further confirmation presented to the kingdghi years previous to this grant.The Patent Rolls contain no entry of a corporation toany municipal body ^ before this time.The Hull charter does not commence, as had been beforeusual, with an inspection of the former charters ; but,reciting the king's good disposition to the place, in expresswords incorporates the mayor and burgesses givi^ them alsoexpress corporate powers.Incorporations however did not immediately become general: for this charter is followed by others upon the ?vll^which are not of that description.But Plymouth Ipswich Southampton CoventryNorthampton Woodstock,' Canterbury,^® Nottingham,^^and Tenterden, were incorporated by similar terms, andaccording to the new form adopted for Hull.It is not surprising that the corporations did not spreadmore speedily; because the corporate bodies which thenexisted had already begun to abuse the powers given tothem, and to make usurpations upon the rights of thepeople.The companies and liveries of London had been makingencroachments upon the privileges of the householders in thewardrobes ;^ and it appears that the guilds also had exercisedabuses to such an extent, that it became necessary for Parliamentto interfere for the protection of the people.In the Parliament Rolls of the 16th of Henry VI., 1467,it is said, that " the guilds, under colour of general wordsin their charters, had made many disloyal and unreason.860,P. 870, 875.P. 884.P. 861.« P. 880.P. 889.P. 869, 880, 883, 888. * P. 871.7 P. 881. « P. 883.P. 892. »* P. 896,d 2xxxvi INTRODUCTION.able ordinances, by which many were deprived of theirfranchises for the private profit of the guilds, but to thecommon damage of the people." For which reasons theywere for the future put under restraint in making such ordinances,^^ in disherison or diminution of the franchises of^' the king, or others ; or against the common profit of thepeople."In an entry of the same reign upon the Parliament Rollsrelative to the guild of tailors at Exeter ^ it is stated, thatthe persons who had been admitted by the guild intotheir fraternity were of such number, and of such wilddisposition, and so peaceable, that the mayor of the citycould not guide and rule the subjects there, nor correctsuch defaults as ought by him to be corrected, according'^to his duty and charge. And besides they had madedivers conventicles, commotions, and great divisions amongthe people ; contrary to the laws and peace of the king,in evil example, and likely to grow to the subversion anddestruction of the city, and to the good and politic rule ofthe same, unless due remedy was made by the king'Whereupon the king was petitioned that the guild might beannulled.Thus the documents collected to this period, establishthat from the earliest institutions,' as long as the commonlaw system of municipal government was maintained, theking's peace was preserved — his just prerogative was supported,and the privileges of the people were protected.But as soon as aggregate corporate bodies were introduced,contrary results ensued, and abuse and usurpation gainedsuch an ascendancy, that even the Legislature had difficultyin restraining them ;^ particularly the mischiefs resultingP. 897. ' P. 43. » P. 891, 898.INTRODUCTION. xxxviifrom the admission of non-residents to the injury of the inhabitants; — of which such striking proofs appear in subsequentperiods of our history.It was also in this reign n that attempts to interfere withthe elections of members to Parliament first occur : andthough they were not in the beginning extensive, yet inthe succeeding reigns they became more general, andsubsequently spread themselves to no inconsiderable extentover the greater part of the kingdom.Notwithstanding the grants of incorporation to Hull,Plymouth, and the eight other places in the reign of HenryVL, in the succeeding reign of Edward Iv,* there weremany charters granted which did not incorporate the placesto which they were given. Thus the charters to thecitizens of Norwich' and their heirs, which made the city acounty of itself, did not incorporate it. The same remarkis applicable to the confirmation to Bristol Nor werethe Cinque Ports, important as they were, incorporatedat this period : ^ and there was an express decision thatBury was not so.^ But the community of the inhabitantsof Romney Marsh* and the drapers of Shrewsbury' are expresslyincorporated with the usual corporate powers andnames. As well as the city of Rochester Stamford,'Ludlow, Grantham,*® Wedlock," Bewdley,^ and *'But, under these circumstances, the real effect of chartersof incorporation should be considered. Their object wasmerely to give to the grantees a general name by which theymight sue and be sued, and take and grant lands; andthat they should enjoy all their rights, privileges, andP. 950. » P. 960. •' P. 9(51. * P. 999. » P. 1002.• P. 965.

Their effect extendedonly to these points ;* leaving the constitution, privileges,and the class of burgesses precisely in the same situationafter the grant as before.There is a striking instance, to show how little changewas effected by the inhabitants being made burgesses, inthe incorporation of the adjoining village of Southron,*with Dartmouth : where, though the charter directs thatthe inhabitants of Southron should be burgesses of theborough, it prescribes no formal mode of election or admission;but apparently leaves all connected with thatpoint to the due course of the common law ; only directingthat there should be a view of frankpledge : the consequenceof which would be that the inhabitants would be sworn atthat court. The omission of any precise direction on thishead, is strong to show that there was no other particularadmission or ^ election for the burgesses of Dartmouth, withwhom these inhabitants were to stand on an equal footing.The first case in which the courts of law laid down themodern doctrine, as to municipal corporations, occurred inthe sixth year of Edward IV., 1466 : — when it was held inthe Common Pleas, that " if the king gave land in fee-farmto the good men of the town of Dale, the corporation was** good. And so likewise where it was given to the burngesses, citizens, and commonalty," &c.This appears to be a strong position, and laid the foundationof corporations by inference or implication; upon whichsuch important results were raised in subsequent times.It is true the doctrine was qualified in the manner wehave before remarked ; \ but afterwards the qualificationwas forgotten, and in modern law the principle has been» P. 968. 2 p 975 3 p 1013.^ See before Introduction, xxxiv. — and post, p. 1021, 1023.INTRODUCTION. xxxixadopted generally. Hence the early charters of immunitiesof the reigns of Henry II., Richard I., and particularlythose of King John, have in later times been regarded ascharters of incorporation — a character to which they are byDO means entitled ; as the reader may be satisfied from theinspection of the documents themselves — ^or the charters —quoted in this work ; to some of which reference has beenmade in this Introduction.This, therefore, is the material point for consideration : —and it is one, upon which an opinion is stated with confidence— that the doctrine of inferring municipal corporationscannot, if fully investigated, be supported upon principle.It is an obvious remark, that if these early charters couldenure as corporations, the frequent and express grants ofincorporation to Hull, Plymouth, and other places beforenoted, were unnecessary; particularly for some of them,which previously possessed charters of immunitiesThe i increasing importance of the House of Commonswhich '^^mTT^nrH jn theft nairn nf P^nry VI continuingth rough those of Edward IV., Richard III., and Henry VII .,arrived at a gr eat height in that of Henry VIII.

On thesegrounds many efforts were made to control the elections.utters were written rfinQmi ;nftr|d iT^g thp.filprt^^yfl ^< ^ rftneiypparticular candidates, which in some cases were successful,and in others failed. ,. »In the reign of Edward IV. it ap pears from the Pastorxl INTRODUCTION.letters, that upon a doubt being entertained, whethera particular candidate would succeed upon such a letter it)j was suggested, in case of his failure, that ** there were many** decayed boroughs in Enghnd^ which ought to return*' members to Parliament but did not ; and that for one ofj " those he might be returned."Upon t his suggestion Henry VII L acted to so me extent ;but Queen Mar y and Queen Elizabeth to a muc h greater ;in consent once of wh ici the House of Co mons at la stinter feared an d stayed the power of The crown in thi srespect 1 by inquiring into the grounds upon which someof those places returned their members to Parliament :and by those means put an effectual bar to such a course ofproceeding. Nor after this inquiry were many boroughsadded to the list of those who were enabled to send membersto Parliament ; the last exercise of the prerogative inthat manner being in the case of Newark : since which noborough has been either created or restored by the crown.I r During the same period corporations were also spreadingthemselves over the kingdom under the king's charters.\\ Henry VII. and Henry VIII. both granted many of incorporationto boroughs in England, Wales, and Ireland ; andwhen a check was given to the interference of the crownin summoning new places or restoring old boroughs, theonly course which remained, was to obtain an ascendancyin those already existing.The most secure mode of effecting this, seemed to beby placing — under charters of incorporation — the principalpower in select bodies : and under the claim of prescriptionthe corporations were said to have the exclusive right ofelecting their own officers : and, in some instances, alsothe members to Parliament.^ Page 1009.INTRODUCTION. xUQueen Elizabeth, with this view, granted charters tomany boroughs; in the recitals of which it was stated,without any support from fact, t hat they had been incorporatedfrom time ime morals and had enjoyed many privilegesbyprescnption! Of the boroughs and the burgesses,it might be true that they had existed from time immemorial;because we have seen boroughs in the Saxon sera,and in the reign of William the Conqueror: and charterswere granted to some between that period and the time ofRichard I. Bflt^o f^ munich pal corporations it was untrue;for there were none such either before or at the Conquest;nor were t he c charters given to boroughs before the time or^1^??'^ Vagrants of incorporation.These recitals, therefore, were untrue, and ought not tobe relied upon, and as unfortunately they have been, bothby the committees of the House of Commons and the courtsof law, as supporting the groundless presumption of corporationsby prescription.Queen Elizabeth did not at the commencement of herreign make any alteration with respect to the boroughs. Itdoes not appear to have been her wish or her intention' to do80 ; and therefore her erst grants ^ were merely confirmations—as to Huntingdon — Bristol — Poole — Marlborough, &c.Indeed, that popular princess ascended the throne with sostrong a national feeing in her favour, and the restorationand confirmation of the Protestant religion were so favourablyreceived by the majority of the people, that any interferenceon the part of the crown with the elections wouldhave been inexpedient and unnecessary. R reasonable doubtsmay indeed be entertained, notwithstanding what has beenurged by many authors, whether any real control w as exercisedover the first elections.» P. 1220.xiii INTRODUCTION.This, however, is certain, that if any thing was meditatedor attempted with respect to the boroughs at the commencementof her reign, it is not perceptible in the chapters grantedat this period, or in the parliamentary proceedings.So precarious is popularity — and so uncertain even iathis country is public opinion — that the queen did not longenjoy her undisputed ascendancy; nor the nation theblessings of undisturbed quiet. It was not till the fifth yearof her reign, when, after an interval of four years, thenecessity of a supply led to the calling of another Parliament,that six boroughs, Gregory — St. Germain's — St. Makes —Minehead — Tamworth — and Stockbridge,^ — were summonedto send members to Parliament ; none of them havingdone so for a long interval, and the greater portion not at all.The members were, after a debate, allowed to sit, and thecharters were to be examined for the purpose of ascertainingtheir right to be returned. All these places afterwards continuedto send burgesses to Parliament ; but under suchcircumstances as have called for particular remark.It must be borne in mind, with reference to the subjectof our inquiries, that the question — who were to returnmembers to Parliament? which by the writ was cast uponthe burgesses — was in fact the same question as who werethe burgesses ? and therefore, though the elective franchisehas been settled by the Legislature, the investigation as tothe municipal rights, which remains open, is to be illustratedby a reference to the parliamentary decisions.In all these six places the right of election was exercisedby the inhabitants paying scot and lot ; in most of themit was limited ; in some by express decisions, to the householders.In all of them the court ket existed, and was inthe full exercise of its powers.» p. 1223.INTRODUCTION. xliiId Trtgimy^ the absurd right of potwallers was introduced; in St. Germain's and St. Mawesy it was limited tothe householders. Neither of these places have been incorporated.In Minehead? the burgesses were determined to be theparishioners — the right of the pot-boilers was attempted tobe set up, but negatived. It was incorporated — its corporationwas dissolved ; upon which the constables the commonlaw officers appointed at the court leet, became thereturning officers — ^and Minehead continued to return membersnotwithstanding it ceased to be a corporation.Tamworth was a borough by prescription — it was incorporatedin the third year of Queen Elizabeth — the right ofthe select body of the corporation, consisting of the bailiffsand twenty-four capital burgesses, was reestablished againstthe ^^ populace r but at a subsequent period it was supersededby the right of the inhabitant householders — and anattempt of the freeholders to vote, was also negatived. Theright of the corporation, excepting only the select body,was never insisted upon : but the common law right of theinhabitant householders^ paying scot and lot was in substanceestablished;As to StockbridgCy the right has also always been exercisedby that class ; and all its municipal regulations andgovernment have been transacted at the court leet.Thus fer, therefore, nothing had been either directly orindirectly effected by Queen Elizabeth contrary to thespirit of our early institutions : and even the corporationswhich' had been created had not interfered with the generalprinciples of the law. ' • ^ •But w hen twas asce retained that no more boroughs couldbe summoned, and the crown was driven to seek for otherP. 1226.

And this wasessayed by means of the corporations.The charters of Elizabeth, subsequent to this period,commence with recitals that the boroughs had been ancientlyincorporated ; by which every usage as to the municipalcorporations which had existed for any length of time,was sought to be supported under the plea oi prescriptionsThe charters of Poole,* and East Looe,^ in the 10th yearof this reign, afford specimens of this description./ In the 13th of Elizabeth a new Parliament being assembled,it appears that nine other places, which had notreturned members in the preceding Parliament, had beensummoned, and had sent their representatives. Upon theirvalidity being mooted in the House, it was determined they\ should sit, " for the validity of the charters of these towns\ " was elsewhere to be examined."Some of these places had before returned members, butthe greater part had not. In East Looe the greatest usurpationswere established. In Fowejf^ and Cirencester theright of election was in effect fixed in the inhabitant householders.But in Retfordy the non-residents were decided tohave a right to vote '^ or in other words, the non-residentswere held to be burgesses of that borough — but on a subsequentoccasion their right was denied The exclusiveright of the eldest sons was also set ups but negatived by adivision in favour of all the sons : though afterwards theright of the eldest was again referred to,*® and that of thenon-residents negatived.6. In Queenborough non-residents were introduced, con.1249. ' P. 1239. » p. 1255. * P. 1253. » P. 1281.• P. 1282.

Freemen weretreated as the burgesses, notwithstanding it was not incorporated; and although it subsequently received a charter ofthat description in the reign of Charles I., that fact does notappear in any manner to have altered the character of theburgesses, or the rights or privileges of the borough, exceptby superadding the usual corporate powers.6. As to Woodstock — which first appears as a borough byreturning members to Parliament in the reign of Edward I. —a committee of the House strangely decided that the rightwas in the freemen ; although the writ under which it firstreturned, required the members to be elected by the burgesseswho appear to have been the inhabitants, and it wasnot incorporated till the reign of Henry VI.7. Christchurch? was a borough by prescription, and hadpreviously sent burgesses to Parliament; and the mayorwas elected at the court leet.^ Its corporations it hadany; was in 1720 dissolved. /8. In Jedburgh, in 1689, the year after the Revolution,country gentlemen, farmers, and others not inhabiting inthe borough, nor paying scot and lot, nor bearing anycharge of the borough, were made free for the purpose ofthe action, contrary to the usage and custom of theborough, and contrary to every principle of the constitutionsAnd though a committee of the House of Commons thusestablished the right of the non-residents, and it was confirmedabout 20 years afterwards, yet within five years,this error was corrected; and the right of election wasdetermined, consistently with the general municipal law,and sound parliamentary principles — to be in " the burgessesresident within the borough." Thus properly uniting themunicipal and parliamentary right in the same class.P. 1301. « P. 1304. » p. 1305. * P. 1307.Ixlvi INTRODUCTION.9. As to the burgesses of Eye the right of parliamentaryelection was exercised by the inhabitants paying scot andlot : but a second class of persons were also allowed tovote, namely, the freemen of the corporation. This wasobviously objectionable, because there could not be twoclasses of burgesses ; and if only one of the two were tobe adopted, there could be no real doubt but that the inhabitantspaying scot and lot were the preferable class.But the proper mode would have been to have reconciledthe two, by deciding that the free inhabitants paying scotand lot — that is the householders, doing their proper suit a^the court leet-should be considered the " burgesses''One result produced by summoning these nine placesto Parliament, was the uncertainty introduced by thesevarying usurpations with respect to the persons who oughtto be burgesses.It The influence which prevailed over the boroughs* at thisOptime, is apparent from an order made by the common1/ council of ColchsskTy that Sir Francis Walsingham shouldI h ave the nomination of their burgesses to Parliament nt.But this strange order appears to have been the act ofthe common council who had usurped the privileges of thecommunity. In many other respects the rights of theburgesses of this place were left untouched ; and their classispointed out by the clearest definition in the constitutionsof the borough. They are described as ^^ householdersdwelling in the borough, sworn to the king, andpaying and bearing scot and lot excepting, amongst others,children not householders — persons who had been convictedof offences — and those receiving or asking relief : — ^adescription, and exceptions, in every respect conformable tothe common law.» P. 1346.INTRODUCTION. xlviiTwelve other boroughs were also newly summoned toParliament in this reign.1. Wellington — ^ the inhabitant householders paying scotand lots voting as the burgesses.2. Beeralston was submitted to the influence of the lordsof the borough,* as soon as it returned members to Parliament,At one time it was contended that the freemen werethe burgesses. Subsequently, without any evidence to supportit, but because it was asserted on one side, and notcontradicted on the other, the freehold tenants, holding byburgage tenure were held to be the burgesses.3. Carse Castle was also the object of influence, as thereader may perceive by the facts stated in the body of thework ; and although there seems to be no other ground forthis place being considered to be a borough, except that ithad a court ket, the freeholders or suitors at the courtbaron, including non-residents, appear to have been treatedas the burgesses.4. Newton? has not been incorporated, and upon nearlythe same grounds as in Corse, non-residents were includedin the right of election.5. Clitheroe,^ was put nearly in the same predicament,by the right of election being attributed to the freeholders.But, from a careful consideration of this case, and thegeneral law, it will be apparent that they should have beeniheresiants; owing their suit at the court leet, where theyought to have been presented by the jewry, and sworn andtnrolkd : — and not the tenants, presented by the homage atthe court baron, which was the proper court for the freeholders; and where the proceedings would have been altogetherof a different description. In consequence of thiserror the most absurd and inconsistent usages appear to» P. 1347. ^ P. 1348. ' p. 1354. * P. 1355.xlviii INTRODUCTION.have crept into this borough ; and the strangest notionswere entertained by succeeding committees who sate uponits elections. Had they confined themselves to the properpoint of inquiring who were the burgesses they could nothave even heard the positions which were contended forbefore them ; but would have been irresistibly drawn to theconclusion that the real burgesses were the inhabitant householderspaying scot and lot ; — who as resiants, owed siiit andservice at the court leet ; and as of free condition oughtthere to have been sworn and enrolled.6. Bishop's Castle When the true question is considered,who were the burgesses in these boroughs, —which seem to have been all created for one purpose,and were all originally intended to be the same — it is extraordinaryto observe, in the decisions of the courts of lawand of the Houses of Parliament, the variety of descriptionswhich have been adopted for them. As to the five precedingplaces — in the first, the burgesses are described as the inhabitantspaying scot and lot — in the four others, as the freeholdersresident and non-resident. In Bishop's Castle they wereassumed to be the corporators but limited to the residents.7. Harwich was not incorporated till some time after ithad returned members to Parliament. Contrary, therefore,to the possibility of right, — to the plain words ofthe charter — and the very import of the name — the capitalburgesses created by the charter, and obviously only apart of the burgesses, were held to be the body, whoaccording to the writ ought to make the returns as theburgesses.8. In Newtovmy^ by another variety, the burgesses wereheld to be the persons who had borough lands, though therewas no evidence to support such a decision.> P. 1365. 2 p. 1365. ' P. 1473. * P. 1367.INTRODUCTION. xlix9. Lymington returned members to Parliament before itwas incorporated, which was not until the reign of James I.It was nevertheless held to be a corporation by prescription ;upon which assumption was also established the inconsequentialconclusion that the select body only were theburgesses.10. In Whitchurch} the burgesses were, by the agreementof the parties, held to be the burgage tenants ; with someridiculous and unfounded limitations as to the quantity ofthe land, and the ancient foundations.11. Sudbury affords a curious instance, of an expressdetermination, that the burgesses had a right to vote withoutmy admission in form to their freedom — a position so contraryto the general principles of the ancient, as well as themodem practice of our law, that it would be difficult toaccount for it, were it not for the variety of usages and customswhich seem to have been go strangely introduced intoall boroughs. All the inconveniences and intricacies result-^ing from the corporate rights were introduced at differentperiods into the borough of Sudbury. The common lawright of freedom by birth and service was mystified withallthe distinctions founded upon modem usages; — were also allowed : ' — and the select body of thecorporation claimed the right of admitting whom theythought fit, without any previous title.* On the first occasionthey admitted no less than 170 ; of whom 160 had noright of any kind ; at the same time excluding, on triflingpretences, many of those who were considered qualified.The illegal and irregular conduct accompanying these proceedings,will be worthy the attention of the reader.12. In Haskmere^ the burgage tenants were held to betheburgesses ; but it will be seen that the proceedings inP. 1372. • P. 1373. ' P. 1378 * P. 1378. * P. 1380.VOL. I. e1 INTRODUCTION.that borough were attended with such circumstances asmost justly roused the indignation of the court before whichthey were produced in evidence;' and called for the severeanimadversions of the judge who presided at the trial.13. Richmond* being incorporated in the 19th of QueenElizabeth, was summoned to return members in the 27thyear of that reign. It had also a court leet. Yet theburgesses were not, either according to the common lawheld to be the inhabitant householders, paying scot and lot ;nor, according to the modern doctrine, to be the corporators: — but without any evidence, they were assumed to betheburgage holders.Thus the reader will find that confusion, by the meansof these varying usages, was superinduced, not only uponthe ancient boroughs, but also on those which were created,restored, or summoned, in modem times ; and nothing hasbeen left more uncertain than. Who were the burgesses ofthe different boroughs ? though, if the ancient history ofour institutions had been regarded, nothing could be moreplain, simple, or certain.The full effect, however, of the new incorporation ofboroughs did not immediately succeed these acts ; — it wassome time before the results followed ; and still longerbefore their consequences could be recognized.Nor would the charters alone have produced the effects,had they not been aided by the support of the law ; andcarried even beyond their original intent by those who wereauthorized to act under them.The first imp orttrnt step w as the^sanction gi even by thejudge s, in the celebrated corpora tion case — in t he reign ofElizabeth — to the validity of elections and the binding effectof the bye-laws, made by the select bodies; by which theP. 1823.

This case has, unfortunately been adopted aBan authority ; and its effect has been considerable ; thoughbang only an opinion, given by the judges to the council ,Mid not a judge went open to appeal or correction n by writof error, it is not entitled to the authority ot a judicialdecision.In the next reign, some slight check was given to theinfluence of the charters and the usurpations of the corporations— sat least as far as related to the parliamentaryprivileges of the burgesses — ^by the decisions of the celebratedelection committee, in the 23rd of James L, whoseproceedings were reported by Mr. Sergeant Glanville ; oneof the resolutions' in the Wine h else, Chippenham. Doverand Newcastle cases' being, that no bye-law could vary orcoDtrol the right of election ; and that the king's charterwas equally inoperative for that purpose .At the same time, this committee revived, as far as layin their power, the pure principle of our municipal institutions,by in effect declaring that " of common riprht the^ ^ burgesses w ere * the inhabitant householders' resident, payingKnit and lot'' Which definition, though somewhat tautologous,yet m substance contained all the qualificationsrequired by the common law to make a complete burgess ;tke scaring g an d enrolment at the court leet being the necessaryconsequence, by the general law, of a person beingaa inhabitant householder within a borough.Thus would the constitution have been practically re-stored, had this wise determination been generally actedapcMi. But, unfortunately, the troubles and dissensions of^ succeeding reign drove the great men who concurred inthis decision from their even course of legal and practical1 P. 1546.

Hence this legal, constitutional, andpractical correction of the abuses then prevalent, slept foralong interval unheeded and almost unknown ; and it wasnot till nearly a century after the days of fanaticism andviolence had passed, that it was again brought to light, andby some persons, at least, deemed to be of little less importancethan many of the provisions of the great Charterof our Liberties.During the succeeding reign ns of Charles 1 1. and Jam es ILnot only was this sound principle totally disregarded, butdirect attacks were openly and nnl^^gifptinprly map npnnt he charters and privily eyes of the corporations, which it willbe our duty to detail in the progress of the w work.The i interference in the reign of Elizabeth, and James I.,\ by charters of the crown — the decisions of the courts—M and the acquiescence of the people — had merged all theborough privileges and jurisdictions in the general notionof corporations ; and as by those means all their rights werebrought under the influence and control of the crown, thesubsequent attack upon them was made comparatively easy.On the Restoration t he statute passed for the correctionof the corporations afforded ready means for that attack,and a pretext for every species of usurpation.Extensive use was made of the opportunity ; the oldmembers and officers of the corporations were displaced —ministers of the crown — officers of state-rand nan-residentswere substituted : and from the proceedings upon thisstatute, it was obvious that no corporation had any chanceof continuing its existence, but by a submissive compliancewith the wishes of the king.Some places justly called down punishment on them-introduction.liiiselves. The violent conduct of the city of London renderedit obnoxious to the king, and occasion was therefore takento call upon the citizens to show by what authority theyclaimed to be a body corporate, and to exercise the privilegesand authority which were specified in the Information.As in fact London had never been incorporated, there isn o doubt that it had no authority to assume that privilegeto itself : a nd therefore to that extent the judgment againstit was certainly according to law.But the proceeding was coupled with party virulence andpolitical malice, which gave a most unfavourable complexionto the case. And it appears to have been altogetheroverlooked, that though the city of London was not incorporated— which in truth was a very immaterial part of itsprivileges — yet it was the most ancient exclusive jurisdictionin the country ; and all the immunities and authority connectedwith that jurisdiction, and with its character as aborough, were its undoubted right, and stood upon as securea ground as the crown, or any title under the law.The same may hb said of all the other boroughs.However, the war was against the corporations ; andafter the success of the London Quo Warranto the kingsent his officers into all parts of the kingdom to terrify thecorporations, by the threats of similar legal proceedings,to give up their charters. The greater portion voluntarilysurrendered them, through the agency of the select bodieson the promise of having new grants from the crown : —against those who were refractory, proceedings were instituted.So that at this tim e the borough rights y which bygeneral miscon caption and practice had been assumed to beidentified with the cor portions were, by the acts of the corporators,and the sure enter or seizure of the corporations,submitted entirely to the mercy of the crown.liv INTRODUCTION.Many of these surrenders were brought in, particularlythose from the West by Lord Bath, just at the time of thedeath of the king; and it remained for his successor, JamesII., to act upon those documents.He fully pursued the plan of his brother, to bring thecorporations under his control ; and therefore, in the grantof new charters in the place of those which had been surrendered,introduced, as Charles II. had done in all thosehe granted, the clauses which gave the whole power to theselect bodies ; and made them all removable at the will ofthe crown.That this was the great object of all his measures connectedwith the corporations, and that these acts were feltby the country as the great grievance of that reign, maybecollected from this fact, — ^that the king's last effort torestore himself if possible to the good will of the nation,was the issuing of his ceiehr^ied Proclamation for the restorationof the corporations - annulling all the surrenderswhich had been made, and reviving the ancient charters.Under these circumstances, it might be expected thatWilliam III., ascending the throne to correct, as it wassupposed, the violent and unconstitutional acts of his predecessor,would have done all in his power to obviate theseAbuses. But the fact is upon record, that some of ibis1 1 warmest supporters were the first to revive and insist. ujLQn^lit he rights of the select bodies ^' and more was done duringthis reign to confirm the usurpations of corporations — theextensive rights of common councils — and the interferenceI of non-residents J than in any other period of our history.Dr. Brady, who was about the court, wrote his biassedand partial work in support of these abuses ; and it wasimmediately followed by a decision in the House of Commonsin favour of the exclusive right of the sect body ofINTRODUCTION. IvBanbury, against a prior decision to the contrary, upon thecharter of Abingdon ; the substance, and almost the wordsof which, were precisely the same ; but the author misrepresentedthe charter of Banbury, and thus procured a decisionID favour of the right he advocated.From this period, the direct interference of the crownaltogether ceased : the indirect interference has graduallylessened ; till in modern times it has become almost extinct: — and no influence can be less, nor less exercised,than that which belongs to the crown.In the same manner the prerogative of granting charterswas also called into action to a smaller extent in the succeedingreigns Queen Anne granted only six charters —hie to Yarmouth making some slight alterations in theelections ; one to Leicester giving some additional justices,with a grant of fairs, &c. ; to Bewdley a charter of restoration,which was afterwards annulled; and to WarehaniySalisbury, and Bristol charters of incorporation.George I., granted only two— one of incorporation toHenley-upon-TkaTnes ; the other to Tiverton; the latterbeing necessarily required in consequence of the accidentaldissolution of the corporation.George II. granted sevens Those to Lostwithiel andLyntCf authorizing an oath to be administered to the coronerone to Radnor, being requisite from their incapacity toelect their annual and other officers — ^that to London relatingonly to the justices of the peace — to Weymouth a mereexplanatory charter — one to Maidstone, granted in consequenceof the dissolution of the corporation — and the lastto Liverpool, explanatory as to the justices of the peace foxthe borough.^ 1.

Radnor,Vi INTRODUCTION.During the 59 years which George III. reigned therewere only thirteen charters granted The first to Colchesterwas in consequence of the old corporation beingdissolved — the second to Winchester a grant of a fK>rtioaof the fee farm — the third to Bath, and the fourth toCarmarthen were charters of incorporation — the fifth toExeter y granted additional justices of the peace, &c. — thesixth to HelstoHy incorporated that place— the seventh toSaltashj was in consequence of the prior corporation beingdissolved — the eighth to Northampton and the ninth toBodmin, were both incorporations — the tenth to Weymouth ,one of explanation — the eleventh to Maldon in consequenceof their former grants having been forfeited — the twelfthto Lampeter, a charter of incorporation and regulatingthe mode of swearing the officers and burgesses, in consequenceof the former grants being lost — ^tbe thirteenthto Lancaster, a charter of incorporation.In the reign of George IV., only three charters weregranted. One to Kidderminster, to increase, in consequenceof the increased population, the number of the magistratesthe second to Stafford, in consequence of the corporationbeing dissolved — and the third to Reading, for the samereason as that of Kidderminster, and to give facility toswearing the annual officers.During the reign of his present majesty, one charter onlyhas been granted, and that to the borough of Wigan, forthe purpose of giving them additional magistrates.Under these circumstances, nothing can have been moreunexceptionable than the exercise of the prerogative of the1.

Iiicrown in granting charters for more than the last century ;and no considerate person can think that this importantfunction of the executive power — so material, when wellregulated to the good government of the country — sogracious, when exercised, to the subject — and so beneficialto the crown, as one of the best links to unite the governedwith the head of the government — can be placed in betterbands than those of the King ; and that to his interference,in the true spirit of the constitution, the people may lookwith confidence for the correction of the abuses which haveprogressively crept into corporations.The real complaints against the prerogative, are nowonly matters of history — they have long since passed away^and no one. who forms a due estimate of the presentdivision of the power of the. state, can for a moment retainthe chimerical notions of danger from the power of thecrown, which in the last century were, for the interestedpurposes of a few, so constantly put forward.It is not, therefore, to the crown that the continuance orthe confirmation of the abuses w which had commenced withthe Tutors, is to be attribute ted ; it may with more proprietybe laid to the account of the House of Co mons —the decisions of the courts of law — and the people.The first, in the reign of William III., passed the actcompelling the sheriffs to make the returns from the electionsaccording to the rights which had last been determinedby the House of Commons. By which means thevarying and anomalous usages of the different boroughsand the contradictory decisions of committees, were sane*tioned and confirmed.The House of Commons also — by its resolution — supportedthe former decisions, however irreconcilable with thecharters or the principles of our institutions ; and, in someIvui INTRODUCTION.instances under the general name of '^ burgesses' introducednew varieties, according to the a agreement o( parties,or the absurd usages of the places which were broughtbefore them.The courts of law relied upon the few early cases towhich we have referred ; and the extrajudicial opinions inthe reigns of Eliz abet and James ; and they fell into thesane course which the House of Commons and the legislaturehad taken, adopting the same rules, by which theyavoided a discrepancy which might have existed injuriousto the character of both, as well as detrimental to thepeople. The courts therefore upheld the same principles —supported usage — maintain ned th e s elect bodies — sanction dthe no n-residents — confirmed numerous bye-laws, not inaccordance with the charters, or with each other; butgiving a different constitution to every different borough ; —and as the greatest and worst innovation of all, gave thestamp of judicial authority to the doctrine of the arbitraryadmission of burgesses by the corporations j . principlewhich had not before been expressly sanctioned by legaldecisions.It must, however, be allowed, that many of the errorsinto which both the Committees and the Courts were led,arose from individual cases being brought before them,upon which they were called upon to decide by suchlight as the parties thought fit to afford them ; and theyhad often nothing to guide them but the usages of the singleborough, upon the constitution of which they were requiredto determine.Had a fit opportunity been afforded them of examiningthe whole system at one view — by having the early laws —the charters of different periods — and the general practice1 R. V. Bird, 13 East, 365.INTRODUCTION. htof all the boroughs brought before them — the task wouldnot have been difficult to separate the good from the evil —to maintain the ancient laws — to uphold the real intentionof the charters — and to preserve the uniformity ofthe boroughs. If they had possessed such an opportunity,highly culpable would they have been if they had notavailed themselves of it ; but, as the case at present stands,no blame can be attributed to them, though it is necessaryhistorically to point out the great part which they haveunadvisedly taken in permitting the usurpations which havethus grown up in the state.The people also — ^to a certain extent — have been led intotheir usurpations by the examples and authority affordedthem. Many have erred in ignorance, or from precedentsestablished by others. At all events the presentheads of the corporations have only followed in the stepsof their predecessors. But if there are in auy of thosebodies persons, who, knowing better things, have for theirown private advantage, abused the rights and privileges ofthe boroughs to which they belong, on them the full forceof censure must deservedly fall.During the reigns of Queen Anne, George I., II., III.,and IV., the abuses to which we have referred were fullymaintained — select bodies — common councils — their bye-laws— and non-residents were supported. Freemen weresubstituted for " burgesses,^^ — and the latter name wasapplied to burgage-tenants— freeholders — potwallers — andinhabitants without any other qualification. The court leetwas neglected — its proceedings disregarded or misapplied.Instead of them courts baron were brought into a prominentsituation in the municipal government of boroughs, forwhich they were never intended.Trace and the companies and liveries connected withIx INTRODUCTION.city particularly in London were more interwoven withthe rights of burgess-ship, than the original constitutionof boroughs would justify : and the unrestrained admissionof freemen as burgesses ^ which was declared to be lawful,laid all the municipal privileges and jurisdictions at thefeet of those of whatever party who happened to possessthe influence necessary to secure the admission of theirfriends Hence in some places, a sufficient number ofnon-resident honorary freemen were admitted to overaweor neutralise the votes of the real burgesses ; making iathis manner the important functions of the separate exclusivejurisdictions of boroughs, not the means of localgovernment, as they were intended to be, but the tools ofparty violence and private intrigue.Such are the varying, contradictory, and anomalousmeanings attributed to the word " burgesses Such is theintricate and involved system which has grown up fromthe progressive effect of gradual abuse and usurpation. —How strongly is this contrasted with the simplicity of ourancient institutions !The detail of the facts and documents collected in thebody of the work, is unavoidably long, — even the abstractof them given in this Introduction, occupies no smallspace. But if either the one or the other should preparethe mind of the reader to discard his prejudices, andforget the bias which habit, and a long contemplation ofthe modem state of things, may probably have produced,the whole might be summed up in a small compass.See the Stat. 11 Geo. I., c. 18. -•^ See the Durham Act, 3 Geo. III. ch. 15» and the numerous cases of this kindparticularly the recent cases of Nottingham and Leicester.INTRODUCTION. XiThe short statement, omitting all unnecessary distincttions, is this : Originally the country was divided intoAir es and boroughs — the people e into bond and free ; theferme r had few if any civil rights — the l after enjoyed allthe privileges of the state, and bore all the burdens.They submitted themselves to the law by taking, in thepnhhc court, before the officer of the king — whether shire -reeve or port reeve — the oath of allegiance. They gavepledges for their good conduct; and they were enrolled forthe sake of publicity — ^for the security of their privilegesand for the imposition of the public pecuniary paymentsof scot J and the performance in due rotation of the publicpersonal duties of lot. As neither of these were, or couldbe, imposed on any but householders^ they only — beingfree sworn, and enrolled — were, in the counties at large,the liberi et legates homines comitatus : and in the boroughs,the burgesses.As long as the distinction of the bond and free continued,the freemen were denoted by Mrth^ marriage, and servitude.When that distinction ceased, those rights lost their substantialimportance, and ought to have been discontinued.In point of practice in the counties, and in many ofthe boroughs, as well as in their charters, the inhabitantsgenerally (subject to their being householders — sworn,enrolled, and paying scot and bearing lot) were substitutedfor the old and more limited class o{ freemen.Subject to that change alone, the ancient system wouldhave continued, had not the introduction of municipalcorporations in the reign of Henry VI.- coupled with thepar tial cessation of the court leet in the reign of edwardIV. — and the consequent prevalence of the court baron —laid the foundation of the subsequent usurpations. By 'the doctrines from time to time applied to the artijidcd'\Iliii INTRODUCTION.creations of corporations — the control of the select bodies —and the capricious election of corporators and fwn-residentswere gradually introduced. Th ose abuses arose fromslight beginnings in the reign of Elizabeth — increased inthe reigns ot^ James and C charles L — we re carried to thegreatest extent py the violent t acts perpetrated in the reignsof Charles II. and James 11., and were finally confirmedin the time of William 111. and Queen Anne : and havesince been acquiesced in by passive sub mission.It is not necessary here to repeat the means by whichthese gradual usurpations have been confirmed — they areoccasionally glanced at in the progress of the work. Butit may be safely said, that they never could have arrivedat their present height had it not been for the co-operationof the people themselves. Truth requires this declaration,and it ought not to be withheld — ^as it is in no small degreeinvolved in the consideration of the remedy.It will naturally be asked, what is to be done ? — showare these evils to be obviated with safety ? The answeris obvious. Retrace the progress of abuse — put an endto the evils which have sprung out of modem usurpationsrestore the ancient simplicity of the municipal institutions,retaining of the present system such parts only asexperience has shown to be practically useful ; and indoing this let the people co-operate in correcting the evilsthey assisted to produce.But it will be further asked, how should this be done ?This consideration must, for a short space be deferred, tillsome of the objections which may be urged have beencursorily answered.It will be said that the system which suited our ancestors,will not suit us.^ Why should this position beassumed ? To swear allegiance to the king and submissionINTRODUCTION. Ixiilto the law is the first social duty : and in some form orother has been practised in every nation, civilised oruncivilised. To be enrolled for the purpose of beingknown, is the common course of all human societies,from the greatest congregations to the most insignificantdab — to share the privileges and bear the burdens is asystem of reciprocity as much connected with the highestprinciples of justice and equity, as it is level to the meanestunderstanding, and consistent with the utmost liberality.Why is this to be assumed as unfit for modem Englishmen?Where is the person bold, or conceited enough tosuppose that his unassisted wit can devise any thingnew, which will be a better substitute for that whichwas practised by our ancestors, and has been departedfrom only by usurpation and abuse, as the historicaldetail establishes.For ourselves, we venture not by speculation to seek forbetter things than our ancient constitution — we are satisfiedwith that which history and experience point out asfitted for our country and its inhabitants. We dare notsuggest novelties : we seek only to restore, in its purity,that which has already existed.Another objection will be made, that it is impracticable.This directly leads to the question of the means by whichit is to be effected.The first essential point to be established is, that theprinciple of jh capricious selection of bu recesses should berenounced, as u found d in law.The next renunciation should be of the equally unfoundedright o the selecFbodies to make brae-laws aff actingthe constitutions of the boroughs. By this alone canany regular system be restored — the charters uniformlyconstrued — and the just prerogative of the crown placedin its proper position.Xiv INTRODUCTION.TbeBe preliminaries considered, the task of adjustingthe existing bodies is comparatively easy.The boroughs (which have in modem language mistakenlyassumed the name of corporations) divested ofthese abuses, are capable of being made still the greatestblessings to the country ; as they are the necessary consequenceof great masses of population collected in particularspots; for the good government of whom theseinstitutions afford the readiest means. And, in that view —and that alone — as local separate jurisdictions — the boroughsought ever to be considered.The confirming, improving, and simplifying these institutionsaccording to the ancient principles, should bethepractical object of the statesman, the patriot, andthe legislator.The means of effecting this — after the correction ofthe leading abuses of the arbitrary selection of burgessesthe varying bye-laws — the anomalous usages foundedupon them — the exclusive power of the select bodies — andthe privacy of the proceedings — for which the principlesof law are sufficient — will be to revive the court leet. In■ II ■that court the king's peace is to be preserved — the lawsadministered — public nuisances pr eve need and removed —and the rights of the people — whose court it has beeneemphatically called — asserted and protected.At that legally constituted assembly the inhabitanthouseholders, paying scot and bearing bty ought to attendtwice in the year, at Michaelmas and Easter; the stewardwho is a sworn judicial officer, should preside; and ajury should be impartially impannelled : — serving in theirproper turns ; and selected, as they might be, without thepossibility of packing.One of the first duties of this body would be to presentto the steward every inhabitant householder, paying scot ^INTRODUCTION. Ixvwould be denoted by the public rates — and capableof bearing lot, which would be indicated by the fitness toperform all the public functions of constables, overseers,churchwardens, jurymen, and all the other offices of theplace — including the liability to be summoned by theking's presiding officer to attend the posse burgh, if riotor other circumstances should make it necessary, for thepreservation of the peace.The persons, thus presented in a list to the stewardwould be sworn by him in the p presence of the mayor thedenned, and ot he r superior officers of the borough h^ tokeep their allegiance to the king and the law; and havingdone so would be p publicly enrolled as burgesses, and theirnames recorded as those who were to share the privilegesand bear the burdens of the borough.It should here be observed, that by these simplemeans a list will be formed — without expences publicly-and before the people of the place — of those whowill have the conflicting considerations of benefit andbnrd^i, to incline them on the one hand, to desire, ifproperty qualified, to be placed upon it; and on theother, to refrain from a wish to be so, if the burdenwould, from their circumstances or station in life, operateas a greater inconvenience, than the privilege would bebeneficial : considerations which would also have theirproper effect on the jury, who would determine upontheir oaths, and under the responsibility of their characteramongst their neighbours.To expect that any list, which is not produced by thecorrecting influence of the opposite principles of benefitand burden, will be even tolerably correct, is the mostprobable speculation which theory ever adopted ; and itwas never attempted till recent times. What has been theVOL. I.Lxvi INTRODUCTION.real success of the experiment, must be referred to thosewho have had an opportunity of experiencing its results.As to the jury of the court leet, it should be rememberedthat — besides the obligation of their oaths and thepowerful influence of character — as they would be changedat every court, there would be no temptation to any indirectpractices ; for whatever was done amiss by one jury,would in six months be corrected by another ; and as afterthe first list has been formed, the jury would merely haveto make the alterations in it, which change of residenceor circumstances might in the intervals of the courts haveproduced, their labour would be small, and their field ofaction would be circumscribed.In the mean time, by the operation of this system, thepeople will in effect be taught to govern themselves andwill be instrumental jn administering the law. The advantageso£ this, will be duly estimated by those, who areacquainted with the manners and habits of this nation,and have felt by experience, the effects produced uponthe persons who are from time to time called upon to assistin the dispensations of the law. And without hazardingtoo sanguine conjectures, it may be anticipated that thismode of performing the necessary acts of swearing and enrollingthe burgesses, may be made an effectual meansbinding the people together in one solid union, as thelaw of William 1. describes it under the same system, " utfratris conjugate ;" and that it may at the same time improvethe social and moral condition of the people, bymaking them better men and better subjects, and thusbecome an efficient source of sound government.Regulations will be necessary for the election of presidingand other officers. But if they are all broughtto the same plain and simple principles and transactedINTRODUCTION. licviiat the same court, as in ancient times, they would alladmit of the same easy 'solution, and be followed bysimilar results.It has ever been, and probably ever will be, the practiceof large bodies of men, from a principle of necessity, toconfide their interests to a few. This, in truth, producedthe common councils of old ; and the modem system ofcommittees: — mutual confidence — without which the affairsof mankind cannot be conducted — being the broad basisupon which they all depend. Such bodies must, therefore,always be selected : and to make them useful, they mustbe to some extent permanent. Experience seems to havesanctioned the number of 24. That number of personsshould be selected, not capriciously, but according to theirreal recommendations and qualifications, by the jury —those existing should continue — the vacancies only, tocomplete that number, being filled up by the jury.As permanency of situation, and uniformity of conduct,wonid be necessary for such a body, a small portiononly might be periodically removed.Out of the commo n councilmen, or those who have.served that office, sho uld alone be elected the aldermen -and as their function ns of local give rnment are more importantthan those of the common councilmen, theiroffices should be permanent, as a fixed body for thegovernment of the borough : and as they would thusbecome better acquainted with the requisites for theiroffice, they should have the ower of selecting their own:body. ^The mayor, or presiding officer of the king, shouldnecessarily be selected with care and caution, as holdinga highly responsible situation ; for which reason, thealdermen, the permanent officers of the borough, shouldIxvfii INTRODUCTION.h ave the power of nominating three or more of the commoncouncilmen out of whom the burgesses at largeshould, if a poll were required, have the power of selectingone ; or if not, or in the ease of equality of votes, the juryshould present one of those to the steward to be mayor.All of these acts should be done, and the oaths administeredto the respective officers, in the court leet in thepresence of the steward — the king's presiding officer as thejudge — and of the jury as the suitors ; who ought atall times to include in their presentments all irregularitiescommitted by any of the functionaries in theirproceedings.The public business of the borough — t he settled ntof their accounts — and other affair s — s hould be public ytransacted y and announced before the same cou r t : an dthus just suspicion and jealousy would be destroyed ;and all who desired it would have the full means ofcertain knowledge and information upon the subjectswhich concern them.These regulations are in the pure spirit of our ancientinstitutions : of which the best test is this fact, thatthese measures may be effected under the law as it nowstands — and in this respect, as before observed, theremedy \% in the hands of the people themselves.Every borough has a court leet and a steward to presideat it. The court may in some instances have beendiscontinued : but it is the most clearly recognized principleof the law, that being for the public good, it cannotbe lost by desuetude ; ^ and therefore it may be revived ;and the court may be held — the steward may preside —the jury may be chosen — the list of burgesses may bepresented — and the officers may be elected.See Rex v. Clavering ate Bower. 6 Bar. & Aid. 691.INTRODUCTION.But it may be said, other usages may have existed ;and the charters of the crown may interfere with thesearrangements.The answer is, that as the modem usages are onlysupported by the modem law, so will that law allowthe corporations at present existing to alter those usagesby byt-laws.And as to the charters, if properly construed, it will,be found that very few of them oppose these regulations.As to the admission of the burgesses, whether they actunder usages or charters, under the present practice andlaw, they may elect into their bodies whom they think Lit.If, therefore, any difficulty should be made in thi? respect,the same course should be adopted of holding the courtket; the Jury should present those they find duly qualified: the corporation being duly assembled, at the same.time, should elect as members of their body, those whomthe jury have presented : and thus the proceedings maybereconciled even to the modem law and practice.As to the election of the officers — ^if the charters shouldreally, and in express words, appear to militate againstthis course of election — which ^ for the reasons givenbefore, will be but in few instances — then applicationmight be made to the crown for such an alterationof the charters as should be found necessary. No doubtthe crown, upon that principle of forbearance which hasever guided the House of Brunswick, would not lightlyoff without due consideration interpose. But should parliamenton such grounds address the Throne to giveeffect to these wishes and intentions of the nation, there18 no reason to doubt that His Most Gracious Majesty,would readily exercise his undoubted prerogative for sobeneficial a purpose. And thus would these importantIxx INTRODUCTION.reforms come back into their proper and legitimate course,being founded upon the petitions of the people, throughParliament, and effected by the gracious exercise of theprerogative of the crown.But it may be said, that the people will not bear theirpart in these important proceedings: — the corporationswill not concede the point ; — the people will not acceptthe boon.But who will venture so to traduce the people of thiscountry? If such a course was ready for adoption — ifhis Majesty's Government should be prepared to sanctionit — if the king should graciously incline to promote it —and if such a measure could be effected in such a manner,by the consent of all, can it be possible that the people, —either the corporations, or the inhabitants — the governorsor the governed — would withhold their part of the generalassent ?The enemies of both — those who wish not peace but dissension— may make the uncharitable assertion ; but it isimpossible to be true.The corporations, particularly, their ruling members,are men of character, and high feeling. The late inquiriesinto their conduct have very generally redoundedmuch to their credit. And there never was a periodin which they might with honour so easily relinquishthose usages which they have not themselves instituted,but received from their predecessors : nor could anyoccasion arise in which the people might, with morepropriety, forgetting the past, cordially co-operate withtheir neighbours and present superiors in effecting thisglorious work of harmony — reconciliation — and loyalty.Nor is this mere hypothesis. There are corporations —and many— who are at this moment ready to make these/INTRODUCTION. Lxxi ZqIZconcessions, and some are even meditating them. Numbersof our fellow-subjects are ready to co-operate in this 'exemplary act of charity and peace. Nothing is requiredto carry it into effect but the sanction of a wise, firm, andliberal government and the exertions of those who aresufficiently zealous and patriotic to undertake the taskof bringing these good intentions and motives into fillaction.The object of this work is to give a general view of thisextensive subject. Whether that object has been obtained,the public are to judge ; — whether the conclusionsare just, they are to decide ; — whether any new systemshall be introduced, the legislature must determine. Butthe authors, with a reverence for the simple form of ourancient system of government, may perhaps be excused afervent hope, that — till some certain better form of municipalgovernment can clearly be pointed out, it may nothave been useless to have traced the intricate mazes ofabase and usurpation, in order to restore, through themedium of the law, as it now stands that general uniformsystem of municipal government — which, deeply foundedin the early principles of our law — and connected withthe maxims and analogies of our constitution — has atleast the merit of consistency, and the practical benefitof simplicity.HISTORYOFCORPORATIONS.THE BRITISH PERIOD.In considering the important subject of the rise and progressof our Municipal Institutions opposite errors have been committedby those who have entered upon the Inquiry. Somerelying upon our earliest historians, and their extravagantassertions during periods in which perverted tradition wassubstituted for truth and history was involved in impenetrabledarkness^-^have adopted conjectural conclusions, necessarilyvarious and uncertain ; whilst on the contrary, others, discouragedby these fruitless endeavours, have flown to theopposite extreme of founding their speculations upon thediscordant and anomalous usages at present existing.It is intended to steer, if practicable, an even course betweenthese opposite errors, by resorting exclusively to earlyhistory, where reference can be made to original documents —deducing them, in chronological order, to modem times ; —eliciting occasionally the inferences which arise from them, —or leaving th documents to explain each other as theysucceed in order of dates — and with a view of lessening thefield of doubt, to collect, in the progress, such facts as areclear and undisputed, with the hope that they may illustratethose which are less distinct. A sanguine expectation isentertained, that by these means considerable progress may beVOL. I. BTHE BRITISH PERIOD.effected towards removing the obscurity so long supposed toenvelope this important subject.After so many abortive attempts, this anticipation may bethoughtpresumptuous; but when it is remembered howmany writers on this subject, though conspicuous for theirlearning, talent, or industry, have been biassed in theirspeculations by a spirit of party or political controversy, itmay not be impossible, by dismissing all preconceived prejudices,to glean from their stores those results which theyheedlessly or wilfully overlooked. Lord Coke, it is wellknown, was much misled as to the prescriptive right of parliamentaryelection, by the supposed authority of the oldMSS. of the " Modus tenens parliament," to which heclung with pertinacious anxiety ; whilst Mr. Prynne, fromhis controversy on that point, acquired a bias too strongfor the process of dispassionate inquiry. Neither did thelatter, although he collected all the parliamentary writstogether with great labour, sufficiently compare them withother documents, records, and ancient legal authorities.Having a practical object in view, it is not the province ofthis work to be engaged too long in these obscure portions ofour history from which little can be ascertained with accuracy.It is justly observed by Hume, when speaking of the Britishperiod, ** that although the curiosity entertained by all civilizednations of inquiring into the exploits and adventures of theirancestors, commonly excites a regret that the history of remoteages should be so much involved in obscurity ;" yet he properlyrepresses the unavailing ardour that would push theseresearches beyond ih^ period in which literary monumentsare framed or preserved.Thus warned by the prudent advice of one so experiencedin these investigations, it would be unpardonable to rushindiscreetly on these intricate and unfrequented paths whichhe was unwilling to tread.We find no facts in this period of our history, or in thatof our earlier ancestors the Celts, nor indeed in the contemporaryannals of surrounding nations, which can affordus any distinct and clear guide to the peculiar form andTHE BRITISH PERIOD. 3nature of the particular constitution of the early inhabitantsof this island.The well authenticated facts, that the Britons inhabitedhuts which they occasionally moved from place to place,as necessity, conferences or the feeding of their cattlerequired — ^that they were generally employed in hunting orwarf^are — ^are sufficient to convince us that we cannot withconfidence expect any satisfactory information from thosetimes to assist our present researches. The utmost that couldbe derived from the history of our first ancestors, is the ^indistinct origin of some of those institutions which continuedinto after ages, and which, though not the direct subject ofour inquiry, might nevertheless tend, in some slight degree,to guide our judgments in the investigation of the real sourceof our institutions.Disregarding, therefore, the ordinary references to thoseanchors, who have been so frequently cited for the purposeof illustrating the state and condition of the Britons, butwhich afford no information applicable to our municipalinstitutions, we proceed to the Roman period of our history,m which we shall find some traces of Boroughs, though itmay be much doubted whether they will afford us anymaterial light as to the peculiar nature of the Burghs inEngland. One observation, however, may be made withrespect to the general policy of the laws of the Britonsas administered by the Druids,'*^ bywhom a species of outlawryand excommunication seemed to have been adoptedas one of the methods by which those powerful magicianscontrolled the people, and which consisted in excludingthe denounced party from the advantages of their usualregulations or laws, a provision which appears to have existedin the early history of most nations, and has been continuedin many of them to more modem periods. In thiscountry they were strenuously and severely enforced byour Saxon and Norman ancestors, as one of the effectualmeans of government; and the remains of that system continueto this day in our modem process of outlawry.Strabo, 1. iv. p. 200.b2THE ROMAN PERIOD.CflBsar, speaking of the Druids, says : — Siquis aut privatesaut publicus enim secret iron steterit^ sacrifices interdict.Haec poena apud eos est, gravissima. Quibus ita est interdictumii numero impious ac sceleratorum habentur : ab hisomnes decent actum forum sermonemque defugiunt nequid ex contagion incommode accipiant : neque his pretentiousjus redditus neque honos urus communicate.*THE ROMAN PERIOD.Ant. Whatever the institutions of our British ancestors mightChrist, . ^S5. have been, the probability is, that they were m a great degreechanged, if not altogether obliterated, by their more civilizedand powerful invaders the Romans, during the 400 yearsthey maintained their authority in this island.A. D. 43. Plautus the Roman general, Claudius the emperor, andStories Scapula, gradually extended their arms over thesouth of England ; and Suetonius Pauline, during the reignof Nero, carried them to the more remote parts of thecountry.But Julius Agricola, in the reigns of Vespasian, Titus andDomitian, finally reduced that part of the island usuallycalled England under the Roman dominion, and establishedtheir power throughout the land.The consideration of the change which was effected in theinstitutions and habits of the people, by the introduction ofthe Roman language and manners, and their system of law'\ and politics, is that which is most important to our presentinquiry.Hence it may be material cursorily to consider the leadingfeatures of their institutions, at least as far as they appear tohave been in any degree adopted and continued in this country.Caesar, lib. vi. c. 12. Tacitus, de Mor. Germ. c. 16. Vit. Agricola, c. 21.And see post, as to the term " Law-worthy' in the Saxon Charter granted to Londonby William the Conqueror.tTHE ROMAN PERIOD.It is io£ however necessary to discuss this matter at any lengthyas the subject has been already exhausted by Mr. Spence, inhis learned and elaborate ** Inquiry into the Origin of theLaws and Political Institutions of Modem Europe."It has been asserted, that either the Romans were somuch engaged in making and securing their conquests inBritain as not to find leisure for regarding the municipalestablishments; or, the relative situation in which theystood with the natives of the land, made civil regulationsbetween them unnecessary. These, however, are but conjectures,which aiTord little satisfaction ; and they are opposedby the contrary assertions, that the Roman institutionswere introduced into this country, and the British youth *eagerly engaged in the study of their laws. We may, however,turn from these surmises to. the fact, that be the causewhat it may — ^whether those suggested above, — or that theexterminating inroads of the Saxons obliterated all tracewhich the Romans had left, — or the introduction of the EcclesiasticalLaws at the same time with Christianity, establishedinstitutions which differed from the more ancient habits ofthe Roman nation — there were in the Saxon periods of ourhistory, scarcely any indications to be found of the > civilinstitutions or laws of the Romans, with the exception, perhaps,of a few which related to the descent and transmissionofreal property. ^It may also be added, that in the list of the civil and militaryofficers and magistrates appointed for the maintenanceand administration of the Roman government in Britain,there is scarcely one which corresponds, in any degree, withthe officers mentioned in our Saxon records.Indeed it seems certain, that the Roman laws were un C\known to our early ancestors, and were withheld from them ; ^(^fjfor about the yea r 169, Lucius, who is described as King of ifsBritain, sent to Eleutherius, at Rome, a petition from himselfand his nobles, that the Roman laws might be sent to themfor their adoption in this kingdom. But Eleutherius in hisanswer says, that " he holds those laws in reprobation, andrefers the king rather to the laws of God." ^'JTHE ROMAN PERIOD.The religious complexion of this letter, aid the superstitionof those times, will account for the ready adoption of theadvice of Eleutherius; and hence, from the most ancientrecords which we have of our early laws, a strong tinctureof superstition and religious zeal, with frequent quotationsfrom the Scriptures, form one of their striking characteristics.^ Selden says, that the Civil Law was practised in Englandnearly 360 years, and that Paphian himself presided inYorkshire.* But this seems highly improbable ; and evenwere it so, it is clear from the fishes before stated, and fromthe Saxon laws, that all traces of the civil law were at thattime obliterated. The Folkmotes, and the mode of holdingthem, were clearly of northern origin, and either the remainsof the British institutions, or of Saxon introduction.It is said, that the Romans made both London and Veni-latiumMunicipal or free cities, and all the inhabitants hadthe privileges of Roman citizens.But if this were so, London was certainly afterwards puton a different footing, as may be inferred from the Chartergranted to it by William the Conqueror, which we shallhereafter insert.The inscription of a citizen on the rolls of a city,;}; isan act altogether distinct from our Saxon originals, andthrows 'little light upon this subject. In a further stageof this work, a conjecture will be hazarded, that at someperiod after the knowledge of the civil law was revivedin Europe, II and that code became well known in thiscountry, and studied by the ecclesiastics, the admission ofDissert, in Fletam, cap. 4, et not. in Fortis. p. 8 — 10.t Municipes sunt cives Romani ex Municipal, legions suis et suo jure tents. —Aul.Gell. zvi. 13.X See Cic.

The illustrationof this view of the subject, and of the imperfect manner inwhich these principles amalgamate with the simplicity of ourcommon law, will be attempted hereafter in the properpace.At the present it suffices to say, that in this period of ourinquiry also, for the reasons we have given, little satisfactoryinformation is to be obtained explanatory of the origin ornature of the English Boroughs and Burgesses.That it may not however appear to be altogether overlooked,it should be observed that the Romans undoubtedlyhad Boroughs,* and the name has been supposed to be derived£6m a Greek origin — irvpyo^t ^ tower. But leavingthis etymological surmise to defend itself, it seems probablethat we may have received the term through the Romans, j:And as the actual existence of Boroughs in this countryfrom the time of Edward the Confessor will be hereafterestablished beyond all controversy, this conjecture must notbe considered as altogether unfounded ; particularly as theBoroughs existing in the time of King Edward are not spokenof as if then newly introduced, but as having been establishedso long that they had grown into a part of the politicalinstitutions of the country.However it is clear, that, if we had the term from theRomans, they left us little but the name ; for there appearsno reason to suppose that the Boroughs in England, duringthe Saxon and Norman times, had anything in common withthe Boroughs of the Romans.Cod. Theod. vii. 13. Cod. Just. zi. 65—6. Cod. Theod. xii. 19.t See Brady on Boroughs, p. 1.t Thus there are places in England which probably were named Boroughs bythe Romans, — as Borough Castle, near Great Yarmouth, in Norfolk ; and thereare abo other places called Boroughs in very early times, which have not now, norhave had for many centuries, any trace of borough privileges, as Attleborough,Rickborougb, Templeburgh, Peterborough, Carrowburgh, Drumburgh, Wooden-high,and Gainsborough.8 THE ROMAN PERIOD.V They had also their free cities and towns* as we afterwardshad in England ; but the link connecting the two is now lostand how far they resembled each other it would be very di. ficult to trace.As in most instances we lost the substance of the Romaninstitutions, so also in many did we lose even the name ; — astrong proof that the subsequent inroads of the Saxons, theDanes, and the Normans effectually obliterated the remainsof our more southern invaders.They had in their provinces councils of Decurions; andsuch officers existed in England as a rescript respectingthem is directed to the Governor of Britain ; but no trace ofsuch officers is afterwards to be found here.There is however one circumstance which was much regardedby the Roman Law, and appears also to have beena subject of anxious consideration during all the early periodsof our history — the unceasing effort to prevent vagrancy .JThus, by the Roman law, no traveller was permitted tostray fifty paces out of the public road ; and every personwas located, either by birth or by some other decisive actunder the law, and he was expected at all times to be domiciledin the place to which he was by birth or other circumstanceunited, and in which alone he was enabled to sue forany injuries done to him.The freeman born in a place was expected, at the i^e of21, to return to it; and the proper residence for every individualwas defined by the law|| wiiji the same exactness asin our ancient provisions against vagrancy, and the modemlaws for the settlement of the poor ; all of which, in fact,resolve themselves into the single question, whether an individualbelongs, as a fixed inhabitant, to one place oranother.There were also under the Roman Government certaincompanies probably in some degree analogous to the guilds" Civitas Libera et FoederaU/'—PliD. Epist. x. 93.t Cod. Theod. xi. 7.t Cod. Theod. vii. 5.II Cod. Theod. xiv. 9. Cod. Just. x. 42.Cod.Theod. xiii. 4 & 5. Cod. Theod. xiv. 4. 7. 8. Plan. Epist. x. i2, 43.THE ROMAN PERIOD.which at an early period existed in this country. Thesecompanies also, like our guilds, became so powerful as to bedangerous to the state,**^ and Caesar dissolved all that hadnot existed from old times, in the same manner as the Englishkings in subsequent periods proceeded against theadulterine guilds ; it being a principle of the Roman law thatno company could be formed but under the sanction of theemperor. A similar doctrine, probably derived from thissource, though also intimately connected with other principlesof our law, was subsequently adopted by us, in themaxim, thiit no corporations could be made except by theUnff. It should however be observed, with respect to thesecompanies, that it was an express law that all the membersof them should remain in their proper cities or if they leftthem, should in due time return.Another provision of the Roman law should also be referredto, as in some degree analogous to clauses whichfrequently occur in the earlier English charters. By theTheodosian code the owners of houses in the several citieswere compellable to provide residence and provision for theemperor and the military attending him, when they came tothe city, j: And in the same manner constant reference willhereafter be seen in our most ancient documents,|| and in theearly English charters, to the duty of providing lodging andprovision for the king, when he visited the different parts ofhis kingdom, and passed through the several cities andboroughs. Immunities from this obligation, or at least protectionfrom the abuses of it, were also the frequent subjectsof the grants of the sovereign.Many other instances will occur in the course of our investigationof striking similarities in some of our laws andinstitutions to those of the Romans ; but the detail of themispostponed to those periods of our history in which theySeton.

Wemust therefore, principally, look to the Saxon laws andmanners, in order to ascertain the state of the people at thistime; for if the historians who assert that the language,customs, and political institutions of the country were totally• changed, are not to the letter strictly correct, yet there isevery reason to believe that they, in substance, nearly approachedthe truth. However, the first Saxon invaders were,probably, like the Romans, so much engaged in the turmoilsof war and securing their acquisitions, that their institutions,for some considerable period after their first landing in thiscountry, were rather military than civil, and we have now fewtraces left of their earliest political government.The struggles between the several leaders who, at differentperiods, came over to this country, also retarded the formationof regular laws and institutions ; and before the Heptarchy,Lib. i. c. 15.THE SAXON PERIOD. | J▼eiy little was effected in this respect of wych any traceshave been received by posterity.The earliest records we now possess, upon which reliancecan be placed, are found in this flora of our history; andthough these are but few in number, still they undoubtedlyafford a distinct view of the different classes of society, theirrelative importance, and sufficient indications of their rightsand privileges to illustrate the present subject of inquiry. "*It must always be remembered, that nothing has occurreddown to the present time to. alter the class or description ofpersons who, at the close of the Saxon dynasty , were called** Burgesses'* and that it is in these times we are to directour researches for the class, description, duties, and privilegesof the body of men who, from the commencement of the SaxonGovernment, (if not before,) were called " Freemen''The documents, upon which we can rely with the most confidence,as both authentic and important, are the Saxon Laws*The first are those of Ethelbert, who was kin&c of Kent for Ethelbert.51 years, from' 564 to 616. Bede states that some laws o£ -^ —Ethelbert were in existence in his time in the English Ian*gage.* The extracts here inserted, as well as those ofLothario, Eadric, Wihtrsed, Ina, and the other Saxon Kings,are taken from Wilkins's Leges Anglo-Saxonicee.In these laws the people are described by the genital termleobi; — husbandmen as Ceojilef ;— freemen, by the Saxonword Vyrpnan, Fjmnan or Freeman ; — and servants, as & distinctclass.Sir Francis Palsgrave states the Freemen to be slaves; butthe Dictionaries and Glossaries all interpret the word asfreemen : — and the context, where the word is used, seemsto require that sensesKing's town (Cynmjef tune) is spoken of, as well as the Ethelred.Earl's.Hallam, in his History of the Middle Ages, seems to beof opinion, that the town in which a criminal resided, or hisfamily, was not originally responsible for his crime, butonly, as it were, perpetual bail for him :«— but by the 23rd Sec. 23.Sea Ecc.

The award ofa suit between Wynfleda and Leofwini, concerning lands atHaucbume and Butterfield, which is still preserved in theCottonian library, concludes with a statement of the witnessesto the transaction, who are the King's reeve (cynm^^epjepepa), two others by name, and many a good man in addition,^ meme job man, eaten him.*i^Fd*''* After the reigns of Eadbald, Ercombert, and Egbert,675. Lothairee, brother of the last king, took possession of thekingdom against the right of Edric, the son of !bert.Lothsure reigned 10 years, from 675 to 685. The body oflaws under his name and that of Eddric, ^as* kings of Kent,called also judgments, consist of 16 sections; and the titlei describes Lothairee and Eadric as kings of the inhabitantsSec. 1. of Kent, Cantpapa.t The first section speaks of noblemen '(eoplcunbne mannan),fromwhichit would appear that the earlswere not merely officers, but members of a noble rank, orclass in society. Freemen are also spoken of in these laws,under the same name as in the former; and servants forwhom their lords or thanes were responsible, are described as"manner epic.Sec. 6. The period of guardianship is spoken of as limited to thetime when the ward has seen 10 winters.Sec. 6. The compurgation, by four compurgators, of a freeman whohas committed any theft, is mentioned ; and one of the com-Sec. 16. purgatory is to come from the town to which he belongs, Astriking instance, even in these early times, of the manner inwhich the law treated the inhabitants of the country, as 'sIntroduction to the Calendar of the Ancient Charters,t Papa, says Somner, *' in composition habitation$ vel incols significant ;'* andcites this passage and the charter of London : which see post.THE SAXON PERIOD. 13tacked to the places in which they were born, or in which J^'^^they had their domicile. ^'^'And with reference to the frequent mention, in early charters, ^ ""particularly those of London, of Scot or Scale, or commoncontribution for liquor, it may here be observed, in order toprove the attention which our ancient laws paid to the securityof the people at these convivial meetings," and to theprotection of every man's house, it is expressly provided,that if any man shall trip up another where men drink,he shall pay a fine, as well to the person injured, as to theowner of the hausej and to the king."The earliest trace also of that law (which in a subsequentperiod we meet with again in Bracton*) by which the host wasmade liable for his guest, occurs here : and we find that hewho receives a stranger into his own house for three nights,(that is a merchant or other foreigner,) and whilst he supportshim with his own food, if the stranger does injury to any one,the host shall do the other justice, or lose his right; or, inother words, be out of the protection of the law: — an expressionwhich will tend to explain the term " law-worthy,"occurring hereafter m the Charter of William the Conqueror tothe city of London. vThe people of Kent are called " Cantwaray^ as the peopleof London, in the Charter of William the first abovealluded to, are called the ** Burglary' or the people ofthe Borough of London, though London itself is in theseLaws spoken of merely as a vie, or town, from which thecommon adjunctive appellation of wick is borrowed : — andit is a striking fact, that although the Burgesses of Londonare mentioned in Domesday, London itself is not entered asaseparate Borough, like many other places.It is provided, that if any Man of Kent buys any thing inLondon, he shall have two or three ceorls to witness, or the"King's reeve" J of the wic: — and if the thing is afterwardstaken vrith him in Kent, then he shall produce at the King'sCourt in the City, the person who sold it to him, &c.Lib. iii. fol. 124. 6. t See post.X " Reeve " is by no means a term confined to this country, but seems to haveexisted in Germany ; where, with relation to the district over which his office extends,he is called " Burgreve," " Margrave' and " Landgrave."THE SAXON PERIOD.Lothairee&£dric»675.Mitred,691.And the same King's Court is mentioned in a precedingpart of these Laws ; and the forfeit to the King is calledGeld ;" — a term the meaning and application of whichwill be investigated hereafter.The next Saxon Code is that of Mitred, another King ofthe inhabitants of Kent, who succeeding Lothairee andEdric his brother, reigned from 691 to 725. These Laws,made at Berkhamstead, at an assembly of the great men,called theOemote, and at which were present the Archbishopand Bishop of Rochester, appear to have been made withthe assent of all the people.f It is first provided (as in Magna Charta, and other chartersI of later periods), that the church should enjoy its rights.I Foreigners are spoken of — the ceorls and the priests.Vagrancy (which it was ever the policy of our laws to prevents")is prohibited ; and hospitality is to be denied to avagrant who has not a license.There is also a provision in those laws which relates directlyto the object of our present research: — It is provided, " that^' if any one should make his moxifree at the altar, he shallhe free amongst the people."And if a servant did any servile work on a Sunday contraryto the order of his lord, he is to pay a fine to his lord, orsuffer in his body.The mode of compurgation for a *^ guest " is specified, aswell as for ceorls.The cognizance of accusations against the servants of thebishop or the king is given to the church ; an early instanceof the division of the secular and ecclesiastical jurisdiction.The authority of the reeve is also recognised.The servants of the ^' workmen" are mentioned, as wellas freemen:— sind the power of the king to send offendersbeyond the sea, — the origin probably of our transportation.If a stranger (who is called a *^ foreign coming man') isfound wandering about, not proclaiming his ware by acclaimnation, or by the blowing of a hoist (the usual method inSee poet.

See Costumes of the Cinque Ports,post.THE SAXON PERIOD. ]5those times of giving public notice,) he is to be taken for a ^^^^I*^'thief and slain or redeemed.Another strong instance of the severe penalties which thelaws, as a matter of police, annexed to secret vacancy ; thesuspicion they entertained of strangers, and the importancethey attributed, as weill be fiirther seen hereafter, to local residenceand responsibility. In this law, which is repeated byIna, is probably to be traced the principle upon which noticewas required to be given before any person could become asettled inhabitant of a place.At the close of these laws fines are imposed, varying intheir amounts, for the entire or partial breach of the peace ; —the former apparently for injuries to life or dignity; the latterfor injuries to goods and the like.Another body of laws is ascribed to Ina, King of the West Ina,Saxons, who began to reign in the commencement of the 726.eighth, or as some more accurately state, at the end of theseventh century. He considerably extended his dominions byconquest, and was justly celebrated for the moderation withwhich he used his victories, and his clemency to the vanquished.He also remodelled the laws, making in them suchalterations and additions as might adapt them to his ownimmediate subjects and the conquered Britons.This code is stated in the introduction, to be made by theadvice of the bishops and alderman in the great Assembly, or^ Witan," of the people, and refers, in the commencement,to the " Rights of the People."The third section, concerning work on Sundays,* directs,that if a bondman works on a Sunday by order of his masterhe shall he free; and if a freeman works on that day withoutthe order of his superior, he shall lose his liberty, or 60«.From which it appears, first, that the strong tendency ofthese laws was to increase the number of freemen ; — next, theirfreedom could be obtained by other means than merely bytenure, as some have erroneously supposed ; — thirdly, althougha species of freedom had been obtained by such acts, it couldbe forfeited by subsequent legal disability; — ^and, lastly, thatsome persons, though of free condition, were still, i6 a certainSee also, U. Canute, sec. 42.16 THE'SAXON PERIOD.^°*' degree, under the control of their lords, to whom, by forfeitingtheir freedom, they might again' become subservient*Sec. 6. The sixth section of the laws of Ina imposes a mulct onany person fighting in the king's house, or in the church;*and adds a penalty for any person doing the same in thehouse of an alderman, or other ^epj^cunb man, from which itappears that the alderman was ranked with the wise men ofthe witan; and that the qualification for his office was, liketheirs, the personal recommendation of wisdom, or someother attribute.Sec. 8. The eighth speaks of the denial of justice by the shireman; — from which it is obvious that at that time someperson presided in the shires, and had the jurisdiction of ajudge; probably the alderman, and to that officer may beascribed the origin of the present sheriffs.Sec. 12. The cautious alarm which our ancestors had at all offencescommitted by numbers is apparent in this law, which, afterproviding that a thief taken shall be punished with death,or be ransomed, directs, '' that when seven act together theyshall be considered as thieves;" from seven to twenty-five, a.^ "troop;" and beyond that number, a "band."Sec. 14. And the 14th section provides, that if any person isaccused of having been in a troop (that is, for the purpose ofcommitting any theft), the crime may be remitted to himfor 120 hides : — showing how heinous such an offence wasesteemed.Sec 15.

It is, however, mostindisputable, that this word originally had not a corporatesignification: and it will not be foreign from the subject ofour present inquiry to investigate its primitive use; and bydistinctly establishing its connection with our early commonlaw, to shew that its subsequent application to officersin corporations was only in respect of their representingcommon law officers in their jurisdiction and municipalpowers; their corporate character being merely superinduced— accidental — ^and collateral circumstance, not connectedwith their legal functions.This name appears to have been used from the earliestperiod of our history as a term then well understood ; andthere can be no doubt but that ealbojimen existed, and probablyfor some considerable time, before the making ofthese laws. Lambard translates this word '' senator*' butit is unnecessary to comment at length on this translation,as it can only have been adopted for the purpose of givingit a classical paraphrase. There does not appear to be anythingin the use of the name, either in these or any subsequentlaws, which affords even a remote analogy to thedignity of a senator amongst the Romans; and for thereason given before, all their laws, customs and ranks seemto have been either altogether obliterated by the Saxonswhen they invaded this country, or so altered, that the termsused by the Romans appear entirely inapplicable to theofficers in this country. There seems therefore no necessityfor insisting further that the Roman term '^ senator** isTHE SAXON PERIOD. iginapplicable to the Saxon rank of '^ fallopian ;" nor indeed ^«-does Lambard himself appear to have thought this the ap Alderman.propriety translation, as he afterwards, in the eighth section,applies the same term, senator, to other officers. ^^ .Jnmus, in the Grammar of the Anglo-saxon languagewhich is prefixed to his Etymological Anglican, translatesfallopian" — ^ princeps" — ^which, in its ordinary signification,is probably as far removed as senator from the accuratemeaning of the term in the Saxon laws.The '^ Alderman" was in fact the officer of the king, who /had a control over him, and the power of continuing himin his office after it had become forfeited: — ^from whenceit would seem no strained inference to conclude that, thepower of appointment was also in the crown, as is stated in ;the Saxon Annals, p. 49, and in the Syst section of these jlaws he is called the " king's alderman" — cjnmjef ealbop-annum. «In the 46th section, which relates to the breach of the peace, Af jf[union is mail to tip. *' Bnrniiorh" or town of that ** ^alhon- /■* ^^^"^ ^^allusion is made to the ^' Borough" or tovm of the ^' Fallopian.In the laws of the other Saxon kings, the '' Aldermen" arealso repeatedly mentioned.Thus, in the 3d section of Alfred's laws, which relates tothe breach of pledge, after a penalty is fixed upon breach ofpledge to the king, the archbishop and the bishop, a penaltyis fixed for the same offence against the '^ fallopian."So, section 15, fighting in the presence of the ^^ 6aIbopman"is punished.And in the 33d section of the same laws, a man leavinghis residence, is required to make the ^^ Alderman" acquaintedwith it; — or, as it is in the original, to make the '' Alderman"a witness of it. From this law it appears also, that the districtsto which this change of residence referred were theAlderman's Shire," as it afterwards speaks of the removalfrom one shire to another : and this appears to be general,and to apply as well to borough towns, as to the shire.In the 34th section of the laws of Alfred there is a differencein the title of the alderman ; he is there spoken ofc220 THE SAXON PERIOD.!«*»• as presiding over the " Remote* and is called the cynm jej- — orAlderman. " King's Alderman." Whether there was any real distinctionbetween the alderman, and the king's alderman; and whetherthere were two distinct officers of that name ; or whether theadditional appellation was only given when the aldermanwas performing this part of his iiinction of presiding over theGemote, (a service more particularly connected with his dutyto the king,) does not distinctly appear : but the latter wasprobably the case; particularly, as speaking afterwards ofthe ecclesiastical officer who also attended at the Gemote,he is called the cymnjef ppeojt:, — or king's priest ; and thereis no reason for thinking that there were two orders, theking priests, and any other class.In the 3d chapter of the Laws of athelstan, in the list ofthe were-gilds, or the sums to be paid for the life of a personkilled, the " ealbojiman" is ranked after the king — the archbishop— the earl — or atheling,* (that is, the prince of theblood,) and the bishop.One of the duties of the alderman is mentioned in the5th section of the Laws of King Edgar, which speaks of thehundred, the borough, and the shire Gemote, and directshow they are each to be held: — expressly providing thatat the shire remote, the bishop and " alderman*' shall bepresent: — the former to teach God's law, and the latterthe people's.In the 1st section of the 2d chapter of ethelred's Laws,two ^' ealbopmen-steward and ^Ifric, are mentionedas having, with the archbishop, made a treaty, which wasadopted by the king and the army. The latter was Duke ofMercians and is celebrated in the annals of those times forhis treachery and repeated perfidies ; and the treaty alludedto is probably that which was entered into with the Daneswhen they landed in Essex in 991, and received from theEnglish a considerable sum of money to leave the country.In other parts of the Saxon laws the term alderman ap-athelingor prince of the blood.

Hi vel statevel curb similitude jpa^e^ appellabantur."* But in no instancewas the term, either in the Saxon law, or in anydocument for many subsequent centuries, used as descriptiveof a corporate officer.N. Bacon correctly states that '^ our Saxon ancestors hada magistracy peculiar to each place or township, under onemagistrate or head, whom they called Alderman; who held acourt twice a year, which was in the nature of a Leet, with aView of frank-pledge, as may appear in the cases of Dorchester,Worcester and Doncaster, in Alfred's time.Again, Squire says,j: every person to whose hand the scaleof justice was intrusted, was looked upon by them andesteemed as one of the magnates regni ; and agreeably tothis notion, the decemvir or head of his tithing had thesame distinguishing and honourable appellation of aldermanbestowed upon him, as the governor of the county ; nor wasthere any other difference between them, than merely in theextent, and perhaps duration, of their jurisdiction.THE LAWS OF ALFRED.It was at this period of our history that the Danes made 787 to90i.their first inroad into this country, continuing for some timeafterwards to molest the inhabitants by rapine, cruelty, andbloodshed, and to extend their colonies over the island.Bat, at this momentous sera, the powerful genius of Alfred(fortunately for England) shone forth to support its fallingfortunes, and laid the solid foundation of its future glory.His code of laws commences with the Decalogue : after Sec. ii.Bell. Cat.t Disc, of the Laws, p. 50. LI. Cauti, c. 44. Mire. c. 5. sec. 1.X Squire, 267.22 THE SAXON PERIOD.Alfred, which 1the 1 1th section provides, 1that if any person should buya bondman, he shall serve for six years, and the seventh heshall be 'free*' gratis; and enacts with particularity the tentsupon which he shall depart from or continue with his lord;and the mark which is to be placed upon him to designatehim as a bondman.it is a singular coincidence that, at this early period, itwas a provision that a person should become 'free" afterseven years* service; considering that this appears to have beenthe practice in London in early times — to have since beendiffused and adopted throughout the country — and to have< continued in operation to this day. Another coincidence isstill more remarkable. It appears in the ** Leges Buigorum,"that, by the law of Scotland, though a person became " free"(as in England) by residing away from his lord for a yearand a day; yet he was not thereby absolutely free, but wasreclaimable by his lord, at any time within seven years; afterwhich he was absolutely and irreclaimably free.It must not, however, be forgotten, that all these provisionsare connected with the common law, and with the mode ofascertaining whether persons belonged to that class of societycalled "free;" or, whether they were bondmen: but, ithad no reference whatever to "Corporations," "trade," orany object of that description.It must also be observed from this clause (as well asmany others), that the right of lords to sell their native bondmenis fully acknowledged, and many methods of acquiringfreedom were recognised: — Thus, if the son of a lord deflowereda bondwoman, and he refused to clothe and endowher, she was to be free.Sec. 20. So, also, if any one should inflict a severe bodily woundupon his servant, he was thereby manumitted.Alfred concludes this introductory chapter of his laws,with the declaration that "he had collected together, andcommitted to writing, many of those things which his ancestorshad observed, and which he approved, and with theadvice of his Witan had neglected many of them whichhe did not approve." And he adds that " he had not daredTHE SAXON PERIOD. 23*' to attempt to commit to writing any of his own, for it was Alfred.'^ unknown to him what might be satisfactory to them whosucceeded him ; but whatsoever he could find either in thedays of Ina, Offa, or Ethelbert which appeared to him justhe had adopted, and the rest had neglected." Principles oflegislation, founded upon the experience of the past, andcautious as to speculations for the fixture, not unworthy ofimitation, even in these enlightened times.The 1st section of the 1st chapter provides, as a matter ofthe greatest importance, for the mutual gage and pledge to ~^*-^be given by all people. And if any one shall refuse to performthat which he is pledged to do, his weapon and his goods '^^tetohe taken in trust by his friends, and he is to be com- ^^mitted in custody, for forty days in the king's town, and indefault of being fed there by his friends, the King's reeve isto support him; and if such a person should die, it is declaredthat he should be unavenged ; if he flies, he is to be an exileand excommunicated.It is impossible not to remark the severity of punishmentinflicted by our ancestors for not performing the pledge whichhad been given, as a breach of that confidence between manand man, by which the surest bonds of society, are firmlymaintained.The duration of the imprisonment for forty days, should alsobe noted as a period of time so frequently adopted by ourlaws, in the different sarah of our history.The king's town, jieopme,* is also mentioned, and the king'sreeve ; and banishment and excommunication — punishmentsfamiliar to the Druids, (as we have before observed,) arealso denounced upon the criminal.The second clause provides for sanctuary, and speaks againof the king's town or farm, and of the 'were," or ransom ofamant'The third relates to " Both Breach," and provides, that ifuiy shall break the pledge which he has given to the king,Ll. iEthelsLs. 1.t LI. ^thelsL Introdd. p. 56, and in the Constitutions of ethelred, the ** King'sborough**24 THE SAXON PERIOD.^^fred. he sHall make amends as it seems right to the king; andpenalties are also given for the breach of pledge to the arch*bishop bishop, or 'alderman."It should here be observed, that the pledge to the kingwhich is spoken of, seems to be the origin of " Suit Royal**at the Court Leet, by which a party was bound to providepledges to the king, as sureties to the law, for his good behaviour,and that he should be forthcoming to answer the la^^if any thing should be imputed to him.Sec. 4. In the 4th section, provision is made for the punishment oftreason against the king, earl, and lords.Sec. 5. Further provision for sanctuary is made in the 6th section.Sec. 18. In this clause we have a " twelve hyde man" (that is, atwelve hundred man) mentioned, as well as the " six hundredman," which occurs frequently.Sec. 22. In this section the " Fol-mote" and the " King's Reeve"are spoken of.Sec. 27. The 27th section provides, that if a person has no relations,he shall pay his ransom by those who are in ** Gold" withhim.*Sec. 30. The 30th clause declares, that " merchants" ought to takecare that the men whom they bring with them, shall comeinto the "Fol-mote," before the king's reeve; and should sayhow many they are; and they shall take those whom they canproduce afterwards in the " Fol-mote," to do right. AndI whenever they have occasion to tate more persons with them,they shall give notice of it in the "Fol-mote" to the "king'sreeve."The same caution for the execution of justice to all, andestablishing mutual responsibility to the law, (which we shallhave occasion to remark throughout the whole of the Saxonlaws,) is observable in this section: where the merchants arecompelled to give notice of whom they have with them, andsecurity for their forthcoming; all of which is to be donebefore the " King's Reeve." From which it appears, that theReeve," " Sheriff," or " Praepositus," was the officer of thecrown for preserving the public peace ;+ of which the law wj^sLl. iEUielst. s. 2. t See his duty and punishment, LI. ^Ethelst. cap. ii. sec. 1.THE SAXON PERIOD. 26jealously careful, that even foreigners resorting here for the ^*^*^'purpose of trade and merchandise, were not allowed to comeinto the country without some person being responsible fortheir appearance when called upon, and for their obedienceto the law. It is not therefore a subject of surprise, that wesoon after this period, find traces of that general system ofmutual responsibility by which the police of this country wasin these early times protected, and to which all the subjectsof the realm were required to conform, in the same manner asthe merchants are compelled by this law. And as the inhabitantsgenerally were, for this purpose, submitted to thejurisdiction of the sheriff, so by this law are the merchantsobliged to go before him, for the purpose of enrolling themselvesand their attendants.The thirty-third section provides, that if any one wishes Sec. 33.to go finom one domicile into another lordship, he shall dothis with the testimony of the "alderman" of his "shire."If he shall do this without his knowledge, he shall pay 120^.,half to the king in the " Shire," in which he before was, andhalf in that to which he shall have come. And if he shallhave done any thing wrong where he first was, he who thenhas him in his service, shall compensate for this, and pay tothe king 120^. for a fine.This section is again directed against vagrancy, ensuresresponsibility to the law, and recognises the liability of thebrd for his bondman. And from it may be seen the importancewhich our early legislators attached to a fixed rest*hence, and the scrupulous jealousy with which they guardedagainst capricious vagrancy.* The removing from one placeto another, is here restrained, by the necessity of previousnotice to the alderman, and is punished by a fine, particularlywhere it is accompanied with any misconduct.Probably this law will account for the description of someof the tenants mentioned in Domesday, which occurs sofrequently, viz', " he may go where he will ;" — ^which seems bythe law not to have been the case with servants.A severe penalty is inflicted upon any one who shall fight Sec. 34.Vide poet.

The breach of the peace of the king's borough, is severelypunished ; as well as that of the archbishops, bishops, andaldermen.The preservation of the peace in the boroughs, appears tohave been one of the great objects of these laws, and thebreach of it is punished with the greatest severity.Bocland is spoken of in the 37th section, as descendingfrom ancestors, prohibiting the sale of it away from theheirsSec. 39, relating to feasts, provides, that they shall be holy-daysto all Freemen except servants and workmen, j:Before we leave the reign of Alfred, we should take somenotice of the book which was ordinarily called his ^^ DonorBoc:" — ^we find the following allusion to it by Ayloff. "Alfred,'^ as soon as he found himself freed from the enemies, which*^ in the beginning of his reign had disturbed the public transquality, in order to put a stop to the disorders and licencetediousness which the wars had caused, ordered a survey of'^ the whole kingdom to be made, dividing it into certain'^ counties, hundreds, and tithings ; and having framed certain'^ laws relating thereto, caused a transcript of them and the** survey to*be made, and deposited for public use in his thennew-built abbey of Winchester, where that transcript acquiredthe appellation of edom Boc,' or 'The Judges'Directory,' and was afterwards called ' Romulus Winto-'^ rise.' However, whether such a transcript was written on** a roll, or entered in a book, cannot now be ascertained,** as it hath, in all probability, long since been entirely lost.** Mr. Selden inquired after it in vain, not having been able,** as he assures us, upon the most diligent search, to meet'* with the smallest fragment or trace of it."§'* Ingulphus, speaking of" Doomsday Book," adds, "tale" King's Alderman," see also Introduction to LI.

Each shire was again divided into tithings or^ let's, of which division there are still some vestiges in the^ ridings of Yorkshire, the let's of Kent, and the rapes of'^ Sussex Every tithing was divided into so many centuries''or hundreds f and each hundred into ten decennaries or** districts, containing ten families, or near that number, for^ in such distribution it was impossible to be quite precise'' and accurate.

Promiscuous sales in privacy wereforbidden: — and therefore every thing was to be brought intothe town to be publicly disposed of; which afforded a remedyagainst the sale of stolen property, at the same time that iteffectually prevented forestalling, which the law at all timesendeavoured to restrain. Next, the sale was to be in thepresence of the " Reeve," the king's officer : — and this is theorigin of the interference of the " Port Reeve," " Bailiff,"Provost," or " Mayor," in the sale of articles withinboroughs, as well for entering it, weighing, or measuring, —taking a toll for each of these acts.This was the real foundation upon which the presidingofficer in a borough gave to any person, if he came to live• 1 • ^within it for a short time only, a license to trade ; or, if heresided there for a permanency, that the mayor should ascertainwhether he was a " Free man ;" and if so, that he shouldfm-ol him as a burgess, being one of the permanent free inhabitantsof the place; and in ascertaining whether he wasfree*' the feet of his being a member of a trading guild(if any such existed), was decisive proof of his freedom,Manse a villain could not belong to such a body.Ll. vEthelst. sec. 10, 12, 13. LI.

The " Burh Shire " isa material description of the district with reference to-wrhicfathis provision is made.It has appeared before, that the general divisions or districtsof the country were denoted by the term " Shire i" —\ hence the expression, the subject matter relating to saleswithin towns, is " Burh Shire." We have seen before, thatBurh Breach is the term applied to the breaking the peaceof the town: — therefore it is clear, that in both instancesBurh," applies not to the general division of the countryinto shires, but to that division or district which was a tom,and where there was a reeve to perform the functions requiredof him.Sec. 2. The second section relates to those who deny justice toothers ; and the distinction is taken between " Boc Land" andFol Land :" — ^^The first clearly being, as we have seen inthe 37th section of the Laws of Alfred, that land which anindividual has had particularly appropriated to himself,having derived it from his ancestors ; — whilst ** Fol Land,"which is placed in contradistinction with it, seems to be theland which was held by the people in common. It is alsoapparent from this section, that these matters of right wereto be discussed before the reeve. A further description ofthe nature of Boc Land may be seen in the 75th section ofthe Laws of Canute ; where, if a man of the lord flies fix)mhim he shall lose his land, and the lord shall have it ; butif he has any " Boc Land," that shall be delivered into thehands of the king.

Introdd.THE SAXON PERIOD. 31The 6th section imposes punishment upon a reeve who ^^SfJ**does not govern according to right.From this, it appears that the reeve had a jurisdiction asin this section, he is to pay a fine, if he does not do justiceaccording to the evidence given before him. This is appliedto reeves generally, and not specifically either to the king'sreeve — the shire reeve — or the port reeve — and consequentlymay be taken as including the whole.Pledge or surety — ^**borh" — ^which is to be given for him Sec. 6. ^ ^who is accused of theft. ^ j )It is likewise declared, that no person shall harbour, or Sec. 8.recte as a guest, any person of had repute :* — and if any oneneglects that law, and violates his pledge given to the people,he shall compensate for it as specified in the 'edom Bee:" —and if he should still act contrary to it, he shall lose theamity of all the king's subjects, and all that he hath.This and other provisions excluding offenders from the protectionof the king and his people, and submitting him tothe loss of liberty, lands, and goods, appears to be in conformitywith the subsequent doctrine as to pnemunire, asseen in the statute, 16th Rich. II. c. 5;t and establishes theintentness of the law for the prevention of vagrancy — thejealousy of temporary and occasional residence — and theseverity with which these institutions compelled every personto be responsible for all received within his house — and thosewho acted contrary to this essential branch of police and goodgovernment, were to lose all their property; as being unfit toenjoy any possessions under that law which they contemned,and were to be subjected to a species of outlawry by beingdriven from the society of all the king's subjects, j: '"The ninth section recognises the loss of liberty by the Sec. 9.accusation of theft, and the consequent subjection to servilelabour.And the tenth section provides against receiving the man Sec. 10.(probably meaning the bondman) without the leave of him tovrhom he first belongedLl.

These laws (in the introduction to which the reeves arementioned) having first provided for tithes, speak afterwardsof the " Alderman" and the " Reeve."Sec. 2. The second section makes regulations for those men whohave no lords — ^how they are to obtain " Folc-right"-7-and tohave a lord assigned them in the "Fol-mote:" — ^which ifthey do not procure, they are to be afterwards treated asfugitives,''^ and any person is to be amerced fpr receivingthem as guests.Here a system of mutual responsibility precisely correspondingin substance with the Pledges at the Toum or Leet isclearly defined, as then existing. And it should be observed,that the fol-mote is spoken of generally ; not as confinedeither to the shires, or to privileged towns : — ^and the probabilityis, that at that time the fol-mote was general, andevery person who lived within certain limits, owed suit to it.Sec. 3. By the third section, the lord who denies right and supportshis bondman in wrong, if an appeal thereof is made to theking, is to pay a ransom; — and the lord who is conscious ofthe theft of his bondman is to lose him ; — and if he does thisoften, he is to lose all he has; and the king's reeve, whencognizant of the theft, to suffer the same punishment.It will be seen from this provision as to the lords, thatthey were responsible for the acts of their bondmen, if theywere in any degree cognizant of them; from which it may beLl. Atheist, cap. ii sec. 2. LI. (Edmund, sec. 1 .THE SAXON PERIOD. 33interred that the lords were bound to watch the acts of their Athelstan.bondmen, and that the omission to do so was a species ofmisprision of theft.The eighth section relates to those who have no land ; and ^^- ^•provides, that if such a one serving in another county shouldbe received as a guest by his relations, they might obtainfor him " Fol-right ;" and if he has committed an offence,they shall pay for it.This seems an important clause, both as it relates to thepunishment of those who receive a bondman from anotherplace as a guest, and also as it relates to his obtaining Pole*right by attending at the " Fol-mote :" — but in that case,his friends were to be his pledges.The ninth section directs, that if any one should find his Sec. 9.sheep, five men of his neighbourhood shall be named foribn* (neah^ebujia), and he shall get one of them to swearwith him that he will claim them in '^ Polo-right ;" and ifany one demands to appropriate them to himself, ten menshall be named to him, and he shall get two of themwho shall take their oaths that they were born in his possession.This affords us another early trace of that system whichsubsequently produced the trial by jury, of which England isso justly proud.And in the succeeding section the number of twelve pei> Sec. il.sons, who are to act as compurgators, is expressly mentionedThe 13th section provides for the repair of boroughs Sec. 13.(" Bupjh"), which is to be done within fourteen days afterthey have been perambulated.And the 14th section establishes mints in Canterbury, Ro Sec. 14.Chester, London, Winchester, Lewes, Hastings, Chester,Hampton, Wareham, Exeter, Shaftesbury — of different numbers,and in other boroughs-one.It would be matter of curious investigation, (but foreignfrom our researches,) whether the possession of a mint, beingVit. etiam Judicia Civitatis LuodonUs.t Judicia Civitatis Undone.VOL. I. D34 THE SAXON PERIOD.Atheism. ^ matter granted by royal licence, was not also a characteristicof a borough.Sec. 20. The 20th section provides, that if any person shall be absentfrom the *^ Remote " three times, he is to pay for his contemptto the king ; — and if this is known seven days before the Remote,and he refuses then to do right, and to pay for his contempt,then all the elders who belong to that borough shall goand seize all that he hath, and take it in the place of a pledgefor him.* And if any one who owes suit at the court refusesto go with the rest, he shall pay for his contempt to the king ;and this shall be published in the Gemote, that the kind'speace might be kept, and that every one may abstain fromtheft, at the peril of his life and all that he hath. And ifany one does not abstain, then all the '^ Elders " of thosewho owe suit to the court, and who belonged to that boroughshall take all that he hath : — of which the king shall havehalf — and those men the other half, which they shall take inthe place of a pledge. If he can get nobody to be pledgefor him, they shall seize him. And if he refuses to yield, theyshall kill him, unless he flies; and if any one should defendhim, or should kill any of the suitors, then he shall betreated as the enemy of the king, and of all his friends. Ifhe should fly, and any person should receive him as a guest,such person shall be liable for his ransom, unless he shoulddare to excuse himself, that he did not know he was a fugitive.This clause is important, as clearly defining the proceedingsin the King's Court for the administration of the CriminalLaw, and which in after times was called the CourtLeet ; in which the same mode of taking pledges— compellingpersons to perform their suit and service there — and to do lawand righl^was subsequently practised.This section also shows the ancient nature and object of theFol-mote," then called the Denote, which, in all its essentialqualities, resembled the sheriff's tom and leet. Everybodywas bound to attend, and to give]|sureties there — or, inthe language of the law, " to be put or set in pledge," — andfor not so doing they were outlawed. The object of this systemSee also the Custumals of the Cinque Ports, poet.THE SAXON PERIOD. 35also was the same as that of the Court Leet ; viz. to secure Athelstan.the peace, of the really and to prevent crimes. It should beobserved also, that this provision is general, and applies toall the people — as well those residing in the counties at large,as those residing in boroughs — ^no distinction appearing tohave then existed between those classes of the inhabitants.In the section which relates to the ordeal, the number to Sec. 23.be present is twelve.At the Introduction of the 2nd chapter of Athelstan's Laws,the king complains, ^* that his peace had not been so wellkept as he wished;" and in further directions for the betterpreservation of it, he inflicts (as before) ^' the severest penaltiesof loss of life, and all that they have, against those whoreceive as guests, or harbour such as have offended againstthe laws. From which source alone," the king adds, ^' thatOaths,' ' Bores,' and ^ Pledges,' are^^aU broken and vio*kites''The 1st section of the 2nd chapter providing (like the laws cap. s.of king Edward) against the taking of the bondman of another ^^* ^ 'person, proceeds to ordain, that if the lord should seek unjustlyto condemn his bondman, he may puisse himself of hisoffence, if he can, in the ^^ Fol-mote;" and if he is innocent,be may claim as his witness or commutator, what lord helikes ; because the king adds, '^ I am willing that every onewho is innocent, may attach himself to what lord he likes;"and every Reeve who neglects this, is to pay for his contemptto the king. The section concludes with directing, that thereshall be named in the district of every Reeve, those who areknown to be credible, that they may be the witnesses orcompurgators in every dispute, by the oaths of all of them,without any selection.This section again establishes, that the " Fol-mote" orLeet," was the place in which justice was to be administeredto all under the " Reeve;" and that a jt«ry was to serve theretodetermine all matters that were to be inquired into — ^andthey were to give their answers upon the oaths of all, withouttakii^ the decision of the majority, or determining by anyballot or vote.d236 The SAXON PERIOD.Atheist an. Allusion 18 again made to the twelve compurgators ; and inSec. 2. the same section, the gate of the borough is mentioned,(Buphjeate.)JUDICIA CIVITATIS LUNDONI^.During the time of Athelstan, the ^^ Judicia CivitatisLundonise" are supposed also to have been framed, and itseems probable that they were; as in the introduction tothem, reference is expressly made to the laws which were inthis reign made at Greatanleam, Exeter, and Thunresfeldam.In this introduction, London is calleda"Ji5yri^"or" Borough'*And in the body of the laws themselves, provisions are madefor the punishment of theft. In the division of the propertyof the thief, half is to go to the king, and the other half tothe " Reeve shire," or to the people of the district oVer whichthe Reeve presided. Which is probably a strong proof ofthere being at that time a common stock for each of thoselocal divisions.Amongst these laws, provision is also made for tracingfootsteps from one shire to another ; a duty which is expresslyassigned for the superintendence of the Reeves of the shire ;and they are all enjoined, under penalty of contempt to theking, to give their best assistance to keep his peace.In the course of these laws it is said, that the " Witan"hsA given their pledge to the archbishop of " Thunresfeldam,"with" JElfeah," "Stybb,"and" Brihtnoth," thesonof "Odd,"that every " Reeves should take pledge in his own shirefor all to keep the peace, as King Athelstan had advised;which was again confirmed at Qreatanleam, Exeter, andafterwards at Faversham, and lastly at Thunresfeldam, exceptingthat there should be buying upon Sunday, and alsowithout the town, with credible witness. And the provisionfor the keeping of the peace being repeated, the clause concludeswith directing that the Reeve so offending shall be displacedfrom his office, &c. By a former law, the theft of aperson under twelve years was to be excused ; and no youthLl. (£d. Introdd. LI. Cnuti, 20th Sect,THE SAXON PERIOD. 37should lose his life under fifteen, unless he should defend J}^^<^himself, or fly, or refuse to give himself up. In these laws LuDdome.also the relative situations, the qualifications, mode of becomingand the station in society of the ** Earl' the '' Colony,"the " Thane," the " Common People," and the " Merchants"are specified — ^and the different ransoms for them allparticularly noted.The constitutions of Odo command — " that no man presume A- ^- ^^'to lay any tax on the possessions of the clergy, who are thesons of God, and the sons of God ought to be free from alltaxes in every kingdom," &c.* /This probably was the origin of the clergy being exemptedfrom the burdens to which the people generally were subjected,and from the suit at the ordinary courts of the commonlaw. But it appears from this and subsequent circumstancesabout the same period, that the clei^ were subjectto be assessed by their own body, and that every clergymanwas bound, upon admission into orders, to find twelve bondsmen:in analogy to the pledges given by the laity in thecourts leet.THE LAWS OF (EDMUND.jThe laws of Edmund, like most of the other Saxon kings, 940 to 946. 'relate especially to the preservation of the peace. ;1. Twelve months is the time allowed for paying the ran ^som of a man : — and these laws contain provisions similar tothe former for the giving pledges and security for doingright.Before we quit this period we should observe, that it was tthe duty of the bishop to be present with the *^ alderman" intheir courts, which is one of the many proofs to establishthe union at that time of the civil and ecclesiastical government,though in subsequent periods of our history theywere separatedHen.

In the 2d section of the 2d chapter of the Laws of Edgar,relative to the rights of the people, it is provided, that ** nor" ' one shall appeal to the king unless he is denied law and riff Atat his oui homes'This affords a decisive proof of the anxiety of our ancestors,that the laws should, as far as possible, be administeredlocally — providing, nevertheless, for the weightier mattersbeing submitted to the king.The King's Reeve is also mentioned in an earlier part ofthese laws.Sec. 6. In the 6th section, the " Gemote of the Hundred *' isspoken of, and directed to be held as theretofore. The'^Surgh-mote" to be three times in the year. The ^'Shire^mote' twice; and at the latter, the bishop and aldermen areto attend.And also provides generally, that every man shall find hispledge, who shall produce him at all times to do right, and shallsafely keep him; and if any one does an injury, and flies forit, the pledge shall bear what he ought to have borne. If itis a theft, and he can produce the thief within twelve months,the thief shall abide the judgment, and that which he haspaid shall be returned to the pledge.In these laws we see the " Sheriff's Toum," the " HundredCourt," and the " Burgh-mote " most accurately defined.The Hundred Court is directed to be held as heretofore, L e.according to the Common Law. The Sheriff's Toum is tobe held (as is required by many subsequent laws) twice ayear — at Easter and Michaelmas;-^ — ^and the " Burgh-mote,"or " Court Leet," is to be held three times a year : — ^in conformitywith which, many boroughs are still found to holdthem oftener than twice a year, which are the periods limitedby Magna Charta, and other statutes for holding the SheriffsToum : but in them there is a reservation of the right ofholding them oftener in those places where it has been cussSAXON PERIOD. 39hoary fx> do so. The custom, doubtless, being founded ^'^s^r-upon this early provision of the Saxon laws relative to ^^ Burgh*motes."One of the important functions of the ^^Toum" or^ Leet" is here also specified. Every man is there to findhis pledge — ^who is to have him at all times forthcoming todoright; and if he does not, the pledge is to be responsiblefor him — upon which principle the firm basis of the simple,but practical — police of our Saxon ancestors was founded.Persons of infamous reputation seem at all times, in the Sec. 7.early periods of our institutions, to have been dealt with asnot entitled to the benefits or protection of the law : — and,according to the language of the Charter of London, which weshall see hereafter, as ordinarily translated, they were not** Law-worthy"* For having by their repeated breaches ofthe law shewn their contempt of it, and that they would notbe bound by it, they were in return excluded from those rightsunder it, which others enjoyed — and were considered as outlaws.Thus we find in this section, that every man who hadbeen often accused in his borough, and was found unfaithfulto the people, and did not attend the ** Gemote," that is, theSheriffs Toum, or Court Leet, those of the '^ Gemote," (viz.the guitars of the Court Leet,) should go to him, and he shouldfind a pledge if he could; if he could not, he was to be seizedb any possible manner, whether alive or dead, and he shouldlose all that he had, and pay to his accuser the just ransom ofbis crime; and the lord should have half his land, and thehundred the rest. The latter provision for the forfeiture ofhalf his property to the hundred, being an indemnificationto them for the liabilities they might be subjected to onaccount of the acts of the criminal. Part of which principlesare left in operation to this day, in proceedings against thehundred.The last section mentions Winchester as the place where ^^' ^•the standard for the general coin of the country was to bekeptVide etiam Const. ethelred.40 THE SAXON PERIOD.ISUPPLEMENT TO THE LAWS OF KING EDGAR.«In the supplement to the laws of king Edgar it is expresslyprovided, that in every borough in every shire, there shall beaking's court, as his father had. And that every man, whetherwithin or without a borough, shall be under pledge; andthat wherever it was not then so done, it should be, in everyborough and in every hundred. In every borough there shallbe 33 elected to be witnesses; — that is, compurgators in smallboroughs ; and in every hundred 12, unless more are willing.And every one shall buy and sell with a witness, whether ina"borough" or in a "wapentake;" and every one who hasbeen elected to be a witness, is to take an oath that " neither'^ for money, love, nor fear, nor any other cause, will he say'* any thing hut the truth ;" so that there may be two swornmen present to witness every sale. And a merchant going topursue his merchandise, was to inform his neighbours wherehe was going, and when he should return.These provisions (which are followed by others for thesame purpose) fiirther define and extend the system of givingsecurity by pledges ; and includes within it, not only the boroughswhere larger populations would be collected together —but also places without the boroughs, as hundreds and wakens— ^and thus makes the system general throughout thecountry. The number of the jury or compurgators is expresslydefined; in lai^e boroughs they are to be 33, in smallerthey are limitted to 12 ; and as the minimum would be themost likely to be generally adopted, (these duties being at thattime burdensome,) it is probable that from hence sprung thenumber of 12 for a jury. And this early difference in the numbers,the less being applied to the smaller boroughs, mayhave given origin to the grand and petit jury. The subsequentprovisions shew further the great anxiety of the legislatorsof that day, to make all dealings and merchandise public,as the best means of preventing theft ; — to which object manyof the subsequent provisions also relate, requiring that the merTHE SAXON PERIOD. 4 1chants should declare the purchases they had made, which if lier.they did not,* the men of the town were to acquaint the elderof the hundred, and then they were to be free from punishment;but the merchant was to be punished for not communicating itto his neighbours, and the lord was to take a moiety of his land,and the hundred the other moiety. At the close of this supplement,the "alder dome" — ^as the district over which the"earl" or ** alderman" presided — ^is mentioned, as well as the"aldermen,"THE CANONS OF KING EDGAR.In the canons of King Edgar it is expressly provided — thatnothing between priests shall be .submitted to secular judgement, but their own companions shall settle it, or it shall betransferred to the bishop. This is a very early commencementof the partial division of the ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Andthe same canons provide — that the " Polo-mote*' shall not beheldupon a Sundays At the close of these canons, in thatpart which relates to confession, in the enumeration of thedifferent classes of society, as the inch and poor, young andold, the ecclesiastical and lay, the only divisions foundedupon their station or condition in life, is that of ** Freemen,"and " Bondmen."THE LAWS OF ETHELRED.The laws of Ethelred again direct the giving of pledges, ^^ toand make further provision for the breach of them;the ransoms to be paid — the punishment of flight — and theultimate punishment of outlawry. ^ And they also state, thatevery lord is to have his " hired men" in his own pledge ; —and he is to be responsible for their acts. The provisions forpurchases and exchanges in the presence of pledges andstresses are repeated — and also for the proceedings againstthose who are of bad repute.Vide LI. Northumbrensium Fresbyterorum. LI. Cnuti, Sec. 22.t Vid.etiam LI. North. Press. : Const. iEnhamense ; LL Nati, 15.42 THE SAXON PERIOD.Ethelred. But we muflt Dot ail here to observe, that the law ofEthelred requires expressly, that the persons who are to givepledges are to be *^ Freemen,' — not confining the provisionto Free Tenants" only — but to "a/i freemen generally."In the 6th section of the league which Ethelred madethe breach of the peace within the borough is expresslyspoken of — and the 6th section relate entirely to that sub->jetty and provides that if the peace is violated within theborough, the ^*Bvargh Wara^' or " People of the Borough" areto require from the nearest relatives of the homicide the ransomof his head; and if they will not, the Alderman shall ; andif he will not, the King shall go thither : and if he will not,the whole '^ Alderdome" shall be without the King's peace.Sec. 6. lliia sections worthy of particular observation. It appearsin the first place thais a town was called byjuj: — ^that the peoplein the town in their congregated capacity were called bup^b: —that besides these there was a class of persons who were tobe first responsible, the heaped, perhaps the land-holders: —in their default the ^^ fallopian*' or head man of the place, wasto be compelled to take the responsibility upon himself; andin case he would not do it, then the King, and in that default,we have the striking provision that the ealbojibom or Alder-manywas to be VLXvpprpe — ^that is, unfitted — or excluded fromthe obligations and privileges of which all other places partook.It may be a question what the ealbo]ibom was : — whetherit was any division of the shire, or whether it was thetown or Byju; ; the probability is that it was the former.Sec. 8. Section 8 refers sain to outlawry.Sec. 9. A strong inference is afforded by the 9th section, that thebophs, or pledges, related at that time to the whole county,and not alone (as by modem usage) to boroughs: for at thecommencement of the section, the both, or pledge of a manwho is found with the goods of another in his possession ismentioned — and in the next and succeeding sentences, witnessesfrom other shires are spoken of, and different timesallowed for their coming, according to the distance of theshires.In the 2nd Book of the Constitutions of Ethelred, fiirtherTHE SAXON PERIOD. 43regulations are made for the preservation of the peace^particu- Ethelred.early for the greater boroughs: and it is provided, that wherethe pledge is given in the wapentake, if it is broken, it shallbe compensated for in th hundred. And directions are givenfor holding the Gemote in every wapentake, and twelve of theelders and the Reeve with them, shall swear that they will notaccuse any innocently, or conceal any that are guilty : and inthe distribution of the fines, half is to be given to the lord andhalf to the wapentake : from which it seems clear, withreference to the former laws, that the hundred and wapentakewere similarly circumstanced, and were probablysynonymous.It is a common^pinion,that the only Freemen* Bt this periodwere the Freeholders-but the general tenor of the Saxon lawsproves the contrary, as well as the particular methods of acquiringFreedom, which were by no means limited to tenure.We also find that Freemen are spoken of generally withoutreference to their lands. Again, in other parts of the laws, andparticularly in this, persons possessing lands are expresslycalled by that name — lanbef annum.THE LAWS OF CANUTE.The laws of Canute were made at Winchester. 1017The secular provisions are for the repair of boroughsand bridges, by the levying of " Burg-boot " and " Bridge-boot"And in the 16th section, the law is again repeated, Sec. 16.that a man shall not appeal to the king unless he cannothave right in his own hundred — ^that is, in the 'remote of theHundred."The law is also repeated for holding the '' Bui^h-motes'' Sec. 17.and ** Shire-motes," before the bishop and the '' alderman."The 18th section provides, that no person shall take cogni- sec. 18.dance of any other man within or without the shire, before hehas three times demanded justice in the Hundred Court; andif the third time he cannot obtain right there, he shall go forthe fourth to the Shir&'motey and the Shire-mote shall appointSen. Cod. de Mont. William.44 TH£ SAXON PERIOD.CaDQte. lum a fourth day; and if he should then family then he shallbe at liberty to obtain his right wherever he can.Sec. 19. By the 19th section — every Frbb Man who tithes to beLaw-worthy y^* shall place himself in the Hundred or JDe-canna : otherwise, after 12 years he may be charged with thedefault, and unable to enjoy any privil^es ; so that every oian^whether he be the head of a family, or a follower, shall cometo the Hundred Court, and be put in pledge, and there keephis pledge, and be forthcoming to do right. And it states, thatmany violent persons, if they could, and ought, would wish toprotect their men in any manner they may think fit, whetherfreeman or servant; but the king says he is unwilling tosuffer that injustice. And every man that is 12 years of ageshall take his oath that he will not be a thief, or consent toa theft.This appears to introduce (at least for a time) an importantalteration in the law. Before, as we have seen, the Free Menonly were bound to do suit at the ^V Gemote,'^ and to besworn and give their pledges there : — the lords being responsiblefor their servants or bondmen : — but it seems that thelords had, under colour of this law, been guilty of someirregularities, which the king was desirous of correcting. — sandtherefore, contrary to the former law, he directs that everyperson whatever shall take the oath which is prescribed.But this may help to solve a difficulty which has occurred tomany. It has been said, that all persons residing within theborough, that is all the Resiants — ^whether free or villains,whether householders or inmates — ^were bound to attend theleet. — sand therefore, the owing suit and service at the leetcould not be the test of a person being entitled to be afree man. But an accurate consideration of this law willremove the difficulty. Before, the suit was certainly confinedto " free men:" — Here it is extended to all. But thenit must be observed what each has to do. There is a cleardistinction between the freemen mentioned at the commencementof the section, and all above 12 years old, who aredescribed at the close — including bondmen as well as free.See London Charter, Will. I.THE SAXON PERIOD. ^ 45Hie former are required to be enrolled in the hundred or Canute.decenna, and to give their pledges there — but the latter areonly to take the oath prescribed. The result, therefore,seems to be, that this law requires every, person, be he bondor free, should be present at the court leet, and there take anoath, which, in more modem times, was called the *^ oathof allegiance ;*' that none but freemen were enrolled amongstthe lists of burgesses as freemen, and who gave theirpledges to be forthcoming to answer the law, — ^by which lastacts they became of that class of persons described in ourlegal records as the liberi et legates homines — the free and ^lawful men.And from a subsequent section, the 28thy it is apparent, ^<^- ^•that the oath to be taken by the bondmen was all that theywere required to do, and that the responsibility of the lordsfor them, was not intended to be interfered with — because^t section declares again, that every lord shall have hisservants in pledge.The 23rd section provides — like the laws of Ethelred — ^for Sec 23.the apprehension of infamous persons, not appearing at theHundred Courts, and requires — that all their goods shouldbe sized, but says nothing of their land ; — ^which, unquestionablywould have been the case, if the freeholders alone werethe persons who owed suit at that court.It is provided by the 26th section, that no one shall receive ^^' ^*a servant for more than three nights, unless the person hebefore served should have sent him; nor shall any persondismiss his servant who is accused, before he has purgedhimself of all suspicion.The pledge from those of bad repute, is required in the ^^* ^•30th section, and punishment is to be inflicted if they do notgive it.The 31st section ordains that there shall be one law for all Sec. 31.the boroughs : — a provision highly important, with referenceto the charters, all of which will hereafter be shewn to beessentially the same.Provision is made in the 32nd section, for foreigner and Sec. 32.friendless men, who cannot obtain pledges.46 THE SAXON PERIOD.^^Qute. It IB declared in the 37th Section, that if any ecclesiasticSec. 37.1 or foreigner should be accused, then the king shall be tohim in the place of a friend or patron, unless he have some /{ other lord. /This corresponds with the system established by the formerSaxon Laws, thai for '' freemen" — ^their friends and relations^ should be pledges, and the lords for their bondmen. Theinference arising from this clause is, (in conformity with thelaw of the Court Leet,) that no ecclesiastic was liable to dosuit or service there, or give his pledges : — and therefore such aperson must have somebody to answer for him. Consequentlythis law provides — ^that the king should stand in ^that place, aswell for an ecclesiastic, as a foreigner, who would necessarilybe in the same predicament.Sec. 53. The 53rd section provides the ransom for the breach ofpledge, according to the rank and station of the offender.Sec. 64. The 64th clause ordains — that if any body shall harbour anyperson who is excommunicated or outlawed, he shall expiatehis offence with the loss of his life and possessions.Sec. 76. From section 76 it appears — that the possession oflands and the title to them, was settled before the wholeshire or borough ; for it is provided by that section, that ifany one could shew his title to land by the testimony of theshire, and he dies possessed of it, he might give it to whom heliked best.Sec. 79. And the 79th protects every man in peace, going to or returningfrom the Gemote.EDWARD THE CONFESSOR.1042 It seems that during the period the Danes partially .blushed themselves in this country, many of the Saxon lawswere neglected and superseded ; and it was a fertile source ofcomplaint, that ^^ right was altogether buried in the kingdom'^ and at the same time, the laws and customs were laid'* asleep;* for in their times, a depraved wilfulness of theIt 18 said the Saxon law were superseded for a period of 60 or 70 years.THE SAXON PERIOD. 47'people — ^foTce — ^and violence — rather reigned in the land Edwardthan judgment." Confessor.However, efforts were subsequently made, to ascertainwhat the good laws really were in the time of Edward theConfessor; and after William the Conqueror had obtainedpossession of England, in the fourth year of his reign, bythe advice of his barons, he caused to be summoned allthe nobles, the wise men, (who, probably, in the Saxontimes were called the ^^ Witan") and those who were skilledin the law, that he might hear from themselves what theirkw — ^their rights — and customs were. There were, therefore, /12 persons elected from every county, and they were sworn r-before the king, that as far as they could, they would directly,neither turning to the right hand nor the left, straightforwardmake known what had been sanctioned of theirhwB and customs ; omitting nothing — adding nothing — ^norby prevarication— changing any thing.The laws so framed have been always called the laws ofking Edward the Confessor — ^and no doubt they give us a fairRepresentation of many of the laws and customs which prevailedin his time. But it is also evident, there are manymatters added, which could not belong to the time to whichthey are attributed; and they are not farther authenticatedby appearing in the Latin language — rather than the Saxon.We shall extract only such from them as may be material foroar present purpose.In the 7th section, pledges are mentioned, as in the former Sec 7.Saxon laws: — ^thosewho do not appear to do justice are spokenof as outlaws, (or, in the emphatic language of the times,) Q^ ^as " Wolf head," " Lupin enim merit caput :" — ^and it is /Astated to be the common and general law of all outlaws.This continued to be practised in the reign of King John,when there is a record of a person outlawed upon an appealof murder, for not appearing at three county courts. Itis said that, as he would not be amenable to the king's ^^peace, he should be in no better condition than a wolf, ^A'* greet lupintei caput"*MS. Line. In.

And if any plea concerning themen of other Barons should arise in those Courts, it shouldbe pleaded before the King.Sec. n. The Church, by the 11th section, is declared to be free, andquit of " Dane gild ;" a circumstance worthy of observation,because it will be subsequently seen, that the Church was foralong time after held free of this, and other temporalcharges.Sec. 12. Boroughs and Cities are mentioned in the 12th section —the archbishops' men, ^' villains," and ^^ soke men" — ^are spokenof, and are to pay one sum, whilst *free men's are to payanother. The peace of the four ways is mentioned — ^Watling-strete. Fosse, Hikenildstrete, and Ermingstrete ; but thesmaller ways which led from city to city, and borough toborough, are to be under the law of the shire.Sec. 15. The 15th section provides, that if any one is murdered,the murderer shall be demanded of that will in which themurder is found; and the will is to have a month an aday to find him, and if they do not, 46 marks are to b^levied upon the will : but if the money cannot be raised by thewill, then it is directed to be raised from the hundred : — butas the will might be altogether blended with the hundred,the Barons provided that it should be collected from thehundred.Sec. 16. A reference to the laws of Canute is made in the 16thsection.s^^ 13 The pardon of the king forms the subject of the 18thsection — and provides that the person who is pardoned,shall give his pledges to keep the peace and hold to the law,otherwise he shall be banished.Sec. 19. The 19th section relates to captives — enumerating cities —boroughs — castles — and vills — ^all of which may, therefore,reasonably be assumed, to differ from each other : — andwere we now to describe them, from what we have seenof the Saxon institutions, and what we have collected fromsubsequent documents and charters, we should say that everyTHE SAXON PERIOD. 49city w a borough, but not every borough a city: — and that both Edwardof them returned members to parliament; — the former not as Confessor.a city, but as a borough: — that the castle, whether of a city orborough was distinct from it ; as. many still existing abundantlytestify; — ^that a will was a small town where populationwas collected'together, but not being of sufficient importanceto be made a borough, remained part of the county in whichit was situated.The rest of the section provides for voluntary transportation,in case the king should spare the criminal's life; andany body receiving such a criminal, is to pay a fine for it; —double the second night; — the third night, he is to be treatedas his guest, and the host is to be considered as a participatorin the crime. It also provides that the wives of suchcriminals, suspected of being participators in the crime, areto purge themselves from it: — ^then they are to be legates orlauMCorthy.The 20th section describes with particularity, that important Sec. 20.branch of the Saxon institutions which relates to free boroughs,and states, ^^ that moreover there is a security of the highest'^ and most important description, by which all are protectedin the surest manner; — ^that every man should bind himself^' under the security of a pledge, which the English call"ppeobopjef — ^and the Yorkshire people alone, tien mannatala (the ten man tale." This security was given in thefollowing manner. Every body in every will of the wholekingdom, ought to be under the pledge of the decenna, or tenmen — so that if any one of the ten should incur a forfeiture,the nine should produce him to do right — but if he should fly,31 days should be allowed him by the law; and being sought,and, in the meantime, found, he should be made amenable tothe justice of the king; and should 'forthwith make goodwith the property out of his pocket for the ins fury he had done,'^and if he did not do so, then justice should be executed"upon his own body." But if he could not be found withinthat time, as there was one capital person in every freeborough, who was called the Head Free Borough, (or as theterm is in use to the present day, the "Head Borough') " heVOL.

For,as population was increasing, and questions connected withthese matters became more frequent, the practical applicationof the Rules would be better defined, and more easily described,which appears to have been the object of this amplifiedand elaborate law ; and it should be observed, that thefranchises of sac and soc, and the other liberties, are here firstmentioned, long after the establishment of the Shire-motes orBurgh-motes.Section 28 provides what is to be done when cattle or Sec. 28.money are said to have been found ; — and which are to be inquiredinto in the Lord's Court, if he have a separate jurisdiction; and if not, in the Hundred.This section appears most clearly to define the limits betweenthe sheriffs jurisdiction and that of the lord : — ^and removesone of the great difficulties which has occurred to manyauthors, in considering the court leets granted to the lordsof many manors, although they were not boroughs. Thissection establishes, that, if the lord had full jurisdiction, —equal to that of the sheriff, — viz. that of holding both crie252 THE SAXON PERIOD.Edward final and civil pleas in a court leet, and in his court baron,Confessor. — as the sheriff had in his tom and hundred courts, —then the jurisdiction of the sheriff would be excluded; andin any matter, either civil or criminal, he would direct thelord to provide, that justice should be done — the lord havingthe same jurisdiction as the sheriff. But if the lord had onlya partial jurisdiction — either with respect to the subject to beinquired into — or the persons to be subjected to the inquiry :as if he had only the civil jurisdiction before referred to iathe Saxon laws, of settling civil disputes amongst his people —then the sheriff would be obliged to interfere in all criminalmatters. — Or if he had only jurisdiction over his own tenants,then the freemen and all others residing in the district, wouldbe under the jurisdiction of the sheriff, who would be obligedto interfere. And in neither of these cases would thesheriff's jurisdiction be ousted; but the place, though theland belonged to the lord, would continue to be part of theshire.Hence it is, that in boroughs where the jurisdiction, civiland criminal, was complete : — and where a reeve, mayor,I bailiff or other officer of the king existed as a substitute forI the sheriff — ^then the sheriff was altogether excluded. But. ,' where the lord had only his court baron — and there was noofficer substituted for the sheriff — ^then his jurisdiction conitinned, and the place remained part of the shire. And this,under such circumstances, would continue to be the case,and the place would be subject to the general authority of thesheriff, notwithstanding there should afterwards be a grantof a court leet, which was common for ecclesiastical possessions,as well as for many manors. Of the former we shallhereafter find a striking instance in the case of the two Universities: — ^and the latter is abundantly established by thenumerous grants of court leets to be found upon the PatentRolls.Sec. 29.

And, that there aU ought to come once in theyear, in the kalends of May, and with their faith and oathunbroken, they should unite themselves together into one body,AS SWORN BRETHREN, to defend the king against strangers andenemies, and that they would be faithful to the king — as wellthe princes and earls, as all the chiefs of the kingdom, andfree men; — ^who should all swear their fidelity to the king beforethe bishops of the land. And thus king Arthur is said tohave united the kingdom of Britain, and king Edgar to haverestored it after a long interval. And it is added, that allfreemen ought, according to their means, to defend thekingdom.1 1^" . ri *"*"See the Ipswich Documents in the Reign of King John.54 THE 6AX0N PERIOD.Edward f^ QQ^ section, relating to the Herotocks, does not applyConfessor to OUT present inquiry ;- — farther than that they appear alsoto have been elected in the ^' Folc-tnote/' which Hume, inSec. 36. mammon with many other authors, erroneously conceived tobe a meeting of the " freeholders"*In truth it was a meeting of the **JTee mm^^ as the lawsbefore fully prove.

Nor need more beadded, excepting that the mode of attestation — of purgation —and decision — sat that time, was by twelve sworn cofmpurgatarsor witnesses ; being the origin of that systema of trial by jurywhich, fortunately for this country, has been continued downto the present day. By the same institutions it was wiselyordained, that public responsibility before the eyes of hisneighbours, should be submitted to by every man, claimingthe enjoyment of public rights, by taking the oath of allegianceto his sovereign, sAd binding himself by oath andpledges, to do right to his neighbour, and submit to justiceunder the sanction of the law. ^^'^ .Before we leave this period, it should be observed,that even after the dose examination we have made ofthe Saxoda laws, — and the numerous extracts which havebeen submitted to the reader — there is not a single trace —horn the commencement to the end — of any thing in theslightest degree resembling n Corporation; nor of anythingthat warrants the supposition, that the Iteve{,either of the shire, or of the borough — or the inhabitants^ ''56 THE SAXON PERIOD.Edwaid within the shire or borough — shad any power of selectingConfessor, either individuals, or any class of persons, who were to bedistinguished from others, excepting by that broad distinctionto which we have before alluded — of the freemen — and thosedependent upon their lords.

Inother places — universe quicunque — ^and other words of universaland general application; nothing justifying any selection,but that founded upon irresponsibility from defect ofproperty; general bad repute; or infamy of character, to whichwe have already referred in going through these laws, andto which we shall have occasion again to allude in the subsequenthistories of several of our boroughs.ChartciB. j^^ f^^ municipal charters of the Saxon Kings whichexist at the present day in their original language are grantedto the Bujih-papa of the respective towns. Latin versions ofothers are also to be found upon the Patent and ConfirmationRolls; and there is no reason to doubt that the term *' which occurs in them, is the equivalent, or translation,of the term Bujih-papa of the originals. The questiontherefore is, who were the persons intended by the termBurg-war;" whether a selected body — an exclusive corporation— or the whole of the responsible free inhabitants ofthe place, duly sworn and enrolled.Papa (warn) signifies a man; — but Lye tells us, withoutreference to the subject before us, that this word, when compounded,always means " inhabitant .•"—-for which he citesexamples from the Saxon translation of the Scriptures. Itseems therefore clear, that the whole of the " free inhabitantssworn and enrolled" were included in this term; and we believeit will be impossible to produce any passage from theSaxon Chronicles — laws — or other writings — ^in which theterm is used in a limited, partial, or exclusive sense.That the word Bujih-papa was not applied restricted toa portion only of the inhabitants of a town, may be establishedby extracting a few passages from the Saxon Chronicle,in which it occurs.THE SAXON PERIOD. 57The first place in which this word appears is in 616, where Sj^onit is said, " Mellitus became Archbishop — he was therefore '-Bishop of London; but the inhabitants of London (Lunbun-pajie) where Mellitus had been, were become heathens."It will be seen hereafter, that the first Charter of London,granted by William the Conqueror, is to the " BurgwaraJ*In 894 it is said, '^ They (the Danes) then went to London'' (Lunbun-bypij), and from thence, with the ' inhabitants of^ the borough' (Buph-papu) and those lyho had come tohelp them from the west, — they went eastward, to Beam*let."In the following year it appears that the Danes foughtwith the South Saxons near Chichester; but the 'inhabitantsof the borough" (Bush-pape) put them to flight, slew manyof them, and took some of their ships.In 896, the Danes having fortified their fleet near themouth of the river Lee, '- a great part of the inhabitants ofthe burgh" (Bush-papa) and others, endeavoured to destroythe Danish fortifications. And in the same year the Londonersare described by another word, as the men of London,thus, — the " men of London borough" (London byjuj) destroyedthe ships of the Danes.In 944, the Danes came to London with 94 ships, andfought against it, and endeavoured to bum it: — but theysuffered there more loss and damage than they ever thoughtthat any" inhabitants of the bui^h" (Buph-papu) could effect,for the Holy Mother of God, in pity to the citizens (Buph-pape) delivered them from their enemies.In 1012, all the great men, both clergy and laymen, of theEnglish nation, were assembled at Easter, at London, near towhich the Danish army then was, with the Archbishop ofCanterbury their prisoner; when a great commotion arose inthe army against the Archbishop, because he refused to offerthem any money for his ransom, and forbid others to do so;and in this tumult the Archbishop was slain, — " but the^' inhabitants of the borough" (Buph-papu) bore away hisbody in the morning, and took it to London."In 1013, the Danes amved at Oxford, and the " inhabitantsTHE SAXON PERIOD.SaxonChron.of the borough" (Bnjih-pajiu) immediately surrendered, andgave hostages. Thence they went to Winchester, and didthe same; but when they came to London, the *^ inhabitantsof the borough" (Bujih-pajiu) refused to surrender, but opposedthem in a severe battle. The inhabitants of the boroughof London (Bujih-pajiu), however, at last submitted.In 1017, Canute invaded Mercia, and the Atheling, Edmund,began to collect an army; but the soldiers refused to accompanyhim, unless the king went with them ; and the '' inhabitantsof the borough" (Buiih-pa)m)of London came to helpthem.In the same year, after the death of Ethelred, all thecounsellors or great men at London, and the inhabitants ofthe borough (Bujih-papu) elected Edmund king; and afterwardsthe ^^ inhabitants of London" (Lundene-pajiu) made atruce with them.In 1018, a tribute of 72,0002. was paid fw all England,besides 11,000/. which the ** inhabitants of Lie borough ofLondon*' (Buph-papu) paid*In the commotion which took place in Devon in 1048,between Eustathius the legate and the townsmen of the place,after Eustathius and his men had slain the master of the housewho refused to lodge some of the arrogant strangers, the townsmen(Bushmen) killed 19 of the legate's attendants, and theking was very angry with the ^^ inhabitants of the borough"{Buph^jiu).During the Conqueror's time, in 1068, the Popt-men, ortownsmen, of York, are mentioned.

And observingthe silence of the compiler of this volume, as to any select —exclusive — self-electing number of persons in a town — composinga distinct corporation, is it probable, if such partialcorporations did exist, that no traces of them should be foundin history? Or is it probable, that under such circumstances,all contemporary writers would have used the general term;<<60 WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR.Chron " burgesses," or some tenn equivalent, without adding somequalification, if they intended to describe a part instead ofthe whole of the free and lawful inhabitants ?WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR.1066. Wb come now to that period of our history, in which aforeign king seized, by the power of his sword, the crown ofEngland. It is, however, but an act of justice, and not altogetherforeign from our subject, to rescue his character fromthe stigma affixed to it by early writers, and sanctionedby modem copyists, that this monarch was an inexorableconqueror, seizing t^* the possessions, — trampling poison therights, — and destroying the laws of the country his swordhad won; substituting in their stead the severe and morearbitrary provisions of feudal tenure. It has been said, and ^truly, (for proofs still existing substantiate the fact^VjfcJlMa^one of the great objects of his attention, upon his obtaining .the throne, was the better administration of justice, — thesecuring to the people exemption from all unjust exactions: —and, as one of the most splendid acts to grace the triumph ofa conqueror, re-collecting — reviving — confirming — ^and improvingthe laws of the Saxon kings who had preceded him:*of which we have decisive evidence in the collection of thelaws of Edward the Confessor, the production of his reign.The publication n also o f the laws of William m th e Conqueror,which, undoubtedly, was his own act, and which breathemuch of the spi rit ojF our, .Saxon institutions, should betakenas satisfactory proof of the disposition of the king togovern his new subjects according to their own laws.Legem 57 annie sopitam excitavit— excitation reparavit— reparation decoratingconfirmation — et confirmed vocat est lex sancti regis Edward. — Will.LI. Sax. 216.WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR. 61Again, that this monarch did not seize the possessions ofthe great men of the nation, is abundantly proved by thefiscal compilation of Domesday book, in which the extent ofproperty left in the possession of those who had enjoyed itm the time of King Edward the Confessor, (T. R. E.) cannot6dl to attract the attention of the least observant reader.Both these documents, the laws of William the Conquerorand the Domesday book, will form fit subjects for moredetailed investigation ;* being the sure land-marks, by whichwe may guide ourselves in this early part of our history.The laws of William the Conqueror begin with the proving Laws,sion which ran through all the Saxon edicts, — that all shouldswear allegiance to the king, — and direct that those whocame with him into England, or have come since, should bein his peace, — and impose fines for the breach of this peace,in conformity with the same principles, and in the manner, ofthe Saxon laws. Also, that every French man who wasin England, in the time of Edward the Confessor — partakingof the customs of England which they call Lot and Scot, —should pay according to the law of England ; and that all"free men" should have and hold all their lands and possessions,free from all unjust exaction, and all talliage; so thatnothing should be taken from them but their free service,which they ought of right to do to the king; as it is ordainedfor them, and granted to them by hereditary right, for ever,by the common council of all the kingdom. And it is provided,that all cities and boroughs, and castles, and hundreds,and wapentakes, shall be watched every night, and shouldbe kept in turn against evil doers and enemies, as the sheriffs,aldermen, reeves, bailiffs, and .our ministers, shall the betterprovide by their common council, for the benefit of the kingdom.And that there should be throughout the kingdom, trueweights and measures, as the king's ancestors had ordained.And that all the freemen should be as sworn brothers, for thedefence of the kingdom, the preservation of the peace, andthe dignity of the Crown. The provisions for selling in thepresence of witnesses, and with pledges, are repeated ; and• See poet.62 WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR.^*^- that there shall be no market, or fair, unless in cities, in closeboroughs, surrounded with walls, in castles, and in the safestplaces, where the customs, and the king's right may notbe defrauded ; and for this purpose castles, and boroughs, andcities exist, and were founded — ^that is to wf,for the safety ofthe people of the land, and the defence of the kingdom, andtherefore they ought to he preserved in ful integrity.Provisions for the ordeal and trial by battle are made, andthe king expressly declares, that all shall have and hold thelaws of king Edward in all things. — It is also provided, thatevery man who wishes himself to be accounted yr^e shall bein pledge: — ^in the manner prescribed before by the Saxonlaws: — and the hundreds and counties are to be liable asanciently. And it is prohibited for any person to sell hisman out of the country, and if any one wishes to make hisbondman free, the mode of doing it before the sheriff is minutelypointed out. In these laws,^' Scot and Lot* terms somuch used, — but we may venture to add, so Utile understoodor considered in modem times, — are emphatically called thecustoms of England ; and it is obvious that, as they result.necessarily from the provisions of the Saxon laws, they musthave been in practice as long as those laws were in existence:— for it was the very essence of them that every freemanshould contribute to the public charges, by paying withallthe other freemen his scot; and, in the same manner,take his share with the other freemen in the public personalburdens, or lot : — ^by performing, in his turn, such militaryand civil duties as were uniformly imposed upon all: — asServing in the wars-keeping watch and wait-and fillingin succession the public offices which were required for theState generally, or locally for the borough.*It is a striking circumstance connected with these laws,that they describe the freemen who are to enjoy these privilegesunder them ; and who are in return to give their pledgesto the law ; as " sworn brothers' (conjugate fratris) an expression,which, if not otherwise explained, might have beenSee Waggoner's case, 8 Co. 241, and 23 Hen.

They make provision for the peaceof the churchy and of the king, and forfeitures for differentoffences — as well in the Sheriff's Court, as in thecounty, — they mention those who have soc — sac — ^toU — ^andin&ng^^Thef. — ^^The liability of ^^The phdge&y in case of ^^The flightof the criminal, is enforced.

The several reliefs which are to be paid arethen ascertained.In providing for the fine to be paid by the hundred uponany murder, it is directed that, if the men of the hundred"do not apprehend the criminal they are to pay the fine.We have before seen in the Saxon laws, that this mode ofexpression was frequently used : — for ^^the men of the so€$j*the " men of the hundred* — and the *men of the shire' —often occur in that period, as well as in this of William theConqueror, and in all the succeeding reigns : — thus, in thetime of Henry III., in the Great Charter, ch. 19 ; the constablesof castles, and their bailiffs, are prohibited fromtaking com or other goods of any one who is not of the town(de villa) where his castle is situated.* It is impossible toAnd see Co.Iitt. 234. 6, and Sound, fo. 152.J^iJf/^64 WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR.Laws, doubt in what sense the words "de villa" are here used. In thecharters to which reference will be made hereafter we shall findit the common and general (as clearly it is the natural) descriptionof the people of the place to which the charter is granted.The object of the documents here collected is to show that,according to the clear and obvious meaning of the words,they are intended to describe the" inhabitants" of the place : —although, in modem times, they have strangely been supposedto apply to the selected bodies of corporators; forwhich no satisfactory authority can be produced. — And asthere is the authority of statutes and charters for the other explanation,no question can arise of their being applicable, andintended, to describe these inhabitants of the place :-— whichis the obvious interpretation of the expression, and consistentwith the simplicity of these times, in which few words wereemployed, even in the more complicated affairs of life.Section 29, is stated in the title to relate to the reliefof servants. The word, in the body of the law is " villain*which seems to be introduced here for the first time. Thelaw is itself peculiar, and provides that the lord shall have,for the relief of the mUaifiy the best of his cattle, whetherit is a horse, an ox, or a cow.Now, as the general law was, that a villain could possessno property as distinct from his lord, it seems difficultto suppose how he could have the power of giving any thingto his superior. The latter part of the clause seems toremove this apparent difficulty. It provides that afterwardsall the villains shall be in " frank-pledge." We have beforeseen many methods by which a bondman may procure hisfreedom, and it is obvious that all these laws were intended,rather to promote the acquisition of freedom than the continuanceof village. We have also seen that, if the lordneglected to claim his villain, and permitted him to appearas if he were "free," the lord lost his right, and the villainacquired his freedom. It would seem, i fortiori, to be reasonable,that if the lord dealt with his villain as if he werefree, that thereby he should emancipate him : — therefore, ifthe lord took from his villain a relief, by which he treatedWILLIAM THE CONQUEROR. 65the villain as if he were " free*— recognising his power to ^'^^'»-acquire and possess property — it would seem to follow thatthe villain should be considered free; — and consequentlyought to be in frank-pledge; therefore the law says that, '^ afterthey have given their relief, all villains shall be in frankpledge'Whereas, on the other hand, whilst they were themen — servants — or bondmen — of the lord, he was to be apledge for them, and was to be responsible for their acts, andbound to produce them to do justice. All which obligations,by their becoming free, were transferred from the lord, andwere thrown upon the Fol-mote, hundred, or leet. Thus,' inthis instance, establishing the law — like most of the Saxon jcode — upon the solid grounds of mutual b benefit. As long as I ^7/^^ •the obligation of lord and bonds ^ conti need, t he lord, who.^ I /T^y»'«-«-'V-—tad tl ie advantage of the services w as responsible for th e /servant, and the public, or Fol-mote, could not call upon *liniio bear Scot and Lot wit h them : — b ut as soon as the jse rant b came free from th e lord, the latter loses the services,and is discharged fro m t he responsibility: !— ' f he servantacgJufeT his freedom , and is re sponsibl e^ she Fol-mote,who bind him by his pledges, and enforce upon him Scotand Lot.The 33d section affords another striking instance of the Sec. 33.manner in which William the Conqueror mitigated theseverity of the Saxon laws with reference to the power anddominion of the lords over their tenants ; and, like the precedingsection, shews the spirit of freedom which was thenrecognized in our legal institutions. It provides, that no oneought to molest those who cultivated the land, except for the^* cense" due from them ; nor shall it be lawful for the lordto remove his cultivators from the land as long as they cando their proper service. The neifs or native villains — thosewho ^are villains by birth — ^are here, for the first time, mentioned; and it is provided, that those who depart from theland ought not to seek a false charter of nativity, that theymight not do the proper service which belongs to their land.If a native departs from the land where he was born, andcomes to other land, no one shall retain him, nor his goods,VOL. J. F66 WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR.^^' but shall compel him to return to do the service which belongsto him ; and if the lords will not make the villain of anotherreturn to his land justice shall do it.Sec. 36. Tjjg 3g|jj section provides, that if any one should die intestate,his children shall divide his inheritance between them.This we shall hereafter see was one of the most prominentrights which William I. by his charter recognised asbelonging to the Burghwara or inhabitants of London, who,being designated by his charter, as " free" and " law worthy,"would be entitled to this privilege.Sec. 41. fn the 41st section of these laws the loss of liberty appearsto be first mentioned, and the expression is, that if anyoneshall make light of an injury, or shall give a false judgment,on account of hatred or avarice, he is to be fined forit ; or, in the language of the original, he is to lose his franchise;which no doubt means, that he should lose his freedomor privilege which belongs to a frank or free man, and shouldnot be, like the fi*ee citizens of London, law-worthy.Sec. 43. The provision which so often occurs in the Saxon Laws isrepeated here, *^ that no one shall buy without the boroughor will, without witnesses."Sec. 46. And also in the 46th section, the receiving of any personbeyond three nights is prohibited, unless he is recommendedto the host by a friend, i. e. unless he has through his friendssuch a knowledge of the person, that he would be responsiblefor him.Sec. 47. The 47th section provides, that no one shall allow hisman, i. e. his villain, bondman, servant, or any one of hisfamily, to leave him until he has purged himself from allaccusations : — an important provision, as connected with theselaws, to prevent the impunity of offenders, and to give fulleffect to the Law of Pledges, and to the responsibility oflords and hosts for their men and guests.Sec. 49. Section 49 provides, that every lord shall have his Pledge,who, if he is not purged from all offence, may produce himto do right in the hundred : — ^which is a further proof, confirmatoryof what we have before said, that the lords werenot exempt from the jurisdiction of the sheriff; but, as beingWILLIAM THE CONQUEROR. 67within the shire, were liable to the sheriflTB tom tod hundred ^»^'*'courts.Lastly, the 50th section, provides for purgation by 12 Sec. so.men; and, if the lord does not produce the criminal, butallows him to escape, he is to compensate for it to the king,and is to be outlawed. So severe were all these provisionsagainst any failure in doing justice.These laws, in a further chapter, proceed, with a most Sec.6i.general equity, to provide for the peace, security, judgment,and justice of all English, Normans, French, and Britons ofWales and Cornwall, the Picts and Scots, and of all theking's subjects.They require the oath of allegiance to the king; inflict ^'^punishment for the death of any Norman or Frenchman;and direct that the Frenchmen, who were here in the timeof King Edward, should be in Scot and LoU That the ^^^- ^•freemen should hold their lands in peace, free from charges-andtalliages. They also provide for Watch and Ward in the ^^^^ ^*cities, boroughs, castles, hundreds, and wapentakes; andrq>eat the greater part of the other regulations, to which wehave before alluded, expressly providing for the continuanceof the laws of King Edward, and directing the mode of Sec 65,making Bondmen free.The 66th section declares, as the law is stated in Glanville, Sec. 66.*^ that if any bondman shall have remained without claim for Ia year and a day in our cities, or in our boroughs surroundedwith a walls or in our castUsyfrom that day they shall be madefreemen, and they shall be for ever free from the yoke ofservitude*There is also another chapter of the Laws of William theConqueror, in Saxon, as if it were intended for that portionof his subjects ; and they direct proceedings against Theft,Homicide, and other charges between the English andFrench, which are to be decided by battle or ordeal, or thejudgment of two men, and sometimes by oath ; and the lastsection relates to Outlawry.William the Conqueror appears also in some degree tohave altered the Ecclesiastical Law, or at least the admit268 WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR.i,aw«. filtration of it, by a short Charter referring to that matteralone, and which therefore does not apply to our presentsubject of inquiry.After a careful investigation of these laws, it is impossiblenot to be confirmed in the opinion, that the Conqueror didnot make, or at least' did not persevere, in that extensivechange in our Institutions which has been ascribed to him.1070. Certain it is that he pledged himself by his oath not to do so :4 Will. I.^for, after the insurrection in this year, which was headed byFrederick, Abbot of St. Allan's, William, by the advice ofLanfranc the Archbishop of Canterbury, renewed his coronationoath to the people, and promised to govern themaccording to their ancient laws and liberties, as they hadenjoyed them under King Edward.*DOMESDAY.Having fully examined the Saxon Laws, as well as thoseof William the Conqueror, and shewn the progress of legalprinciples and practice down to the close of this reign, wenow arrive at that period in which the great Fiscal Recordof Domesday Book was collected by that king, and fromwhich. we may expect to find occasional information respectingour present researches.Before however we proceed to its investigation, it may bedesirable to refer to the opinion so generally entertained, thatthe Feudal System was introduced into this country by Williamthe Conqueror.We have already seen, in the Saxon Laws, that a considerableportion of the land in England was held under the lords bypersons of a greater or less degree in bonds, owing servicesto them as well military, as agricultural, and civil ; and from thegeneral tenour of the laws it is obvious, that manumission fromSee Baron Measures on the Ancient Constitutions of Parliament. 2 Arch. Brit,p. 302.DOMESDAY. (jgthese services iras an object of great desire to those dependents.The tenure therefore then existing in England may beassumed not to have been so light or 'easy as some have beendisposed to imagine; but that it was accompanied withburdensome (and in some instances) servile and degradingoccupations. Forfeitures — Escheats — Reliefs — Heriot — andFines — all seem to have been due to the lords ; and thosemore oppressive liabilities to wardship, and the conditionsconnected with marriage, seem also fully to have existed atthat period. There appears therefore to be no solid reasonfor thinking that the material parts of the feudal tenure, evenas exercised by the Normans, did not exist in England beforetheir arrival — particularly when it is observed, (as we shallfrequently have occasion hereafter to remark,) that a veryconsiderable portion of the lands entered in Domesday arethere stated to be held by the same Tenure — at the sameRent — and subject to the same Services, as they were in thetime of Edward the Confessor.The free spirit of our Saxon institutions, the manner inwhich they encouraged the manumission of bondmen, endthe acquisition of freedom, might in some degree haveabated the rigour, in this country, of the feudal system,which had been borrowed from the North of Europe, andwhich may have continued with undiminished, if not increased,tyranny amongst the Normans. — And thus they may,perhaps, have brought over to this country, some of the moresevere provisions, and the heavier services of their law, —but for the reasons given before, they could not be numerous— nor could they now be defined or pointed out withany considerable accuracy — and any attempt at such anundertaking would be attributed rather to an adventurousspirit of conjecture, than of cautious research.The Normans, in all probability, introduced some newprovisions, and attempted more ; as appears by the conclusionof the compilation of the laws of Edward the Confessor —and is in a great degree established by the fact, that thoselaws had for a length of time been neglected, and that itwas a question between the Normans and the English,70 DOMESDAY.whether they should be restored or not. But the fact of their> having been restored is decisive to show, that no great changewas ultimately allowed to prevail — but that in truth the generalsystem of the laws continued much the same under thenew dynasty of the Normans, as it had been under thatof the Saxons, with the exception of a few usurpations,which might have been effected from time to time, bysome few of the more powerful Norman Barons — or wereintroduced by the tyrannical and violent successors ofWilliam the first. It should, however, be remembered,that the temporary adoption of the Norman system, andthe subsequent restoration of the Saxon, may account forthose facts upon which the general hypothesis has beenraised; and at the same time afford an easy solution of thequestion.But be this as it may, it is clear that William, in order .toascertain and secure the revenue which arose from the greatland proprietors, directed that great national record entitled,'' Domesday'' to be made, which appears to have occupiedabout eight years in its compilation, and to have been1066. completed about the 20th year of his reign, the king20 Will. I. g^rviying ^q^ more than one year. It is impossible thatso detailed and minute an account of the different possessionsthroughout the kingdom, should not convey to ussome information of the state of the country at that period,and of the different classes of society.At the same time, errors have been occasioned by seekinginformation from this record, which it is not calculatedto afford.It should always be remembered, that this work wascompiled only for the purpose of affording a rent roll, as itwere, of the tenure and value of the lands throughout thekingdom. Nevertheless, some information on the subject ofour present inquiry, may be found in its precise details ; — atleast, many boroughs are mentioned, and, in some instances,the number of burgesses ; from whence, occasionally, inferencesmay be drawn, as to the class of persons describedunder that term.DOVER.KENT.DOVER,MAIDSTONE,CANTERBURY,HYTHE,Rochester8E8ELTRE,RpMNBY,Norwich.Kent, which produced to us the first specimen of our Saxonlaws, is also the first county mentioned in the Domesday Book.The boroughs, in confirmation of the observation we havebefore made, of their being distinct from the shire, and separatefix>m the jurisdiction of the Sheriff*, are usually placed inadistinct entry by themselves.DOVER.Thus Dover, the rent of which, in the time of King Edward,was divisible between the King, Earl Godwin, and the canonsof St. Martin, has a long entry of the particulars of the landsheld within it. And as to the burgesses it is said, amongst Fol. i.other things, that they provided 20 ships for the king, onceeach year, for 15 days ; and in each ship were 21 men. Theyrendered this service, because the king had granted to themsac and soc. When the messengers of the king came to thisport, they paid three-pence in winter, and two-pence in summer,for the transportation of a horse ; but the burgesses founda pilot, and another assistant ; and if more were required,they were furnished at the royal expense.From the festival of St. Michael to St. Andrew, the hingespeace was established in the town. Whoever violated it, thereeve of the king received the common forfeiture.*Every person inhabiting in the town continually, manesin vUld assidtmSf rendered the royal customs, and was quit oftoll throughout the realm of England.AU these customs existed when King William came to thiscountry.In many parts of Domesday, words are interlaced, which often are necessary tomake out the sense, and, generally speaking, elucidate or explain the text. This isone instance, and many others will occur in the course of these extracts. — They.were, probably, added from other copies ofthe book, or from the inquisitions whichvere returned, and from which the record itself is compiled.72 DOVER.Do mesday. ^^ j^jg gyg^ arrival, this town was destroyed by fire ; andKeuu therefore, its value could not be estimated, or its worth ascertainedwhen the bishop of Bayeux received it. At present itis valued at 40/., yet the Reeve pays 54/.In Dover there are 29 mansions of which the king has lostthe customary payments. Of these the owners are mentioned ;and of three of them it is said, that there was in them aguildhall of burgesses. And as to 10 of them, it is added, thatthey all appeal to the bishop of Bayeux, as their protector,deliverer, and donor. (Protector, et liberator, etvalorem.)One of the mansions is said to have been the property ofan exile, or outlaw, (utls^e exults.) They agree that onehalf of it belongs to the king. And of another mansionit is said, that half was the forfeiture of the king.Roger of Western erected a certain house upon theking's water, and has held to the present period, the customsof the king. Nor was there a house there in the time of kingEdward.In the entrance of the port of Dover, is a mill, which breaksalmost all vessels by the great violence of the sea ; and itdoes great damage to the king, and to the men, and was notthere in the time of king Edward.Of this the nephew of Herbert saith, that the Bishop ofBayeux granted it to be made, to his uncle, Robert Fitzhivon.From this entry we find, that the burgesses supplied, inthe time of king Edward, 20 ships to the king, with 21 menineach ship ; and also other considerable services. It isimpossible such extensive supplies as these could be renderedbut by the whole body of the inhabitants who must be presumedto be the persons described; as those residing uponthe spot, would obviously discharge such personal duties.The burgesses also have soc and sac, which, as we haveseen before in the Saxon laws, gave them a separate jurisdiction.The kings peace is directed to be observed within theplace, for a certain time, in direct conformity with the Saxonlaws ; and shewing a clear identity between the institutionsDOVER. 73which prevailed, both in the Saxon and Norman times. The ^om«day.persons who were to bear the burdens of the place, by ren Kent.during the customs, and who were to enjoy the privileges ofcity by being exempt from toll, must, necessarily, be theburgesses. And they are described to be all the personsinhabiting constantly within the town ;* a definition which,if not recorded, would have been dictated to every person bythe reason of the thing. And yet, two committees of the j ■House of Commons, in 1826 and 1827, decided, upon theunsatisfactory ground of modem usage, against this expressdeclaration, and the decision of the celebrated committee in1623 (to which we shall have occasion to refer hereafter), andthe obvious nature of these institutions, that there could be'anon-resident burgesses of Dover;" and that they wereentitled to the privileges of the place ; one of them beingthat of voting for members of parliament. By the entry,all the above customs— which would include the separatejurisdiction, — the liability of the inhabitants to pay theking's custom, — and the privilege of exemption from toll, — arestated to have existed in the Saxon times, and before KingWilliam came into England ; which is important for the 9 [double purpose of establishing, that the inhabitantSy from ^the earliest time, bore the burdens and enjoyed the privilegesof the town ; and also of establishing that no changewas effected, with respect to these important privileges, bythe coming of the Conqueror.The '^ Guildhall" of the burgesses is mentioned, which Guildhall.might have a tendency to mislead the reader from theassociations in modem times connected with that term.But the burgesses must, necessarily, have a place to assemble,which would be called their hall ; and there they would paythe customs which they owed the king : and, as '^ guilds" isthe Saxon term for paying, and was applied at that time, aswell to the boroughs as the counties, the whole of which beingliable to the payment of the dues, was called the '^ gildable,"there can be no doubt but the term *^ guild" was applied inthat sense.1 1•See also post, the decision of the Committee— 31 James I., 1633.74 DOVER.JioibMdaj. Hence we find afterwards, that Libertas held half a yokeKent, of handy which was for the guild of Dover, u e. which livesFol. 11. B. applicable for the payment of the guild or customs of thatplace.It appears, the king had lost the custom of 29 mansions,from which, in conformity with the previous statement as tothe rendering of custom, it must be assumed, that by somemeans or other, the persons who had those houses were notburgesses, or inhabitants continually residing within the town;because under such circumstances, they would have had topay the custom.It would now . be difficult to show that each of these personswere not burgesses or inhabitants, but it is easy toexplain why some of them did not pay custom : as for instance,the three of them which were converted into theGuildhall, being a place set apart for public purposes, andparticularly for the payment of the custom of the king, noperson would be liable to pay the charge for it. Thesethree houses, therefore, are accounted for. So also the tenhouses of which the Bishop of Bayeux is stated to be thelord, would not pay custom, because, being in the handsof the church, they would not be liable to that burden, butwould be taxed with the possessions of the church — thus13 out of the 29 are actually accounted for: — ^and it is byno means impossible, that the others might also be held ofsome church, or might have been in the occupation of ecclesiastics,or persons dedicated to religion, who would not beburgesses, or liable to the custom. One of them is stated tobe an outlaw, who, for the reasons we have mentionedbefore, would not be a burgess. The other inhabitants ofthese houses might have been the villains of Earl Godwin,who claiming them, they would be under his protection,he being responsible for them: and therefore they wouldnot be sworn or enrolled in the borough, and would not beburgesses. Or they might be the men of the canons ofSaint Martin, and as the men of ecclesiastics, would beexempted from the borough liabilities, and not be burgesses;for in the succeeding column of Domesday, respecting the/CANTERBURY. 76eastern of Kent, it may be seen that the land of the Holy ^"^'^^'Trinity, of St. Augustine, and St. Martin, were exempted ^^^^from reliefs to the king; and it is stated that the king hathnothing from them.At the close of the entry of Dover follow the customs ofKent, which, however, are not material to our present subject,excepting that, as a further confirmation of the continuance Foi 1*of the Saxon institutions, we find frequent reference to the"Ghibrige,'* or breach of the peace — to the Shire-mote —to those also Who have their own soc and sac — to the menof different lords — to the reliefs — forfeitures — the king's half- — the ransom of a robber — the receiving exiles without leaveof the king — and other subjects connected with the Saxonlaws.Before we finally quit the entry of Dover, we shouldobserve, that although it was the head of the Cinque Ports,there is no reference in Domesday to that circumstance, norto any connection with the other ports.CAl^TERBURY.The next entry material to our present investigation is thatof Canterbury, where, amongst other things, it is said, thatin the city King Edward had 61 burgesses paying rent, and212 others over which he had sac and soc. Now the burgessespaying rent are 19.Of the 32 others who had been, 11 were laid waste in theditch of the city. The Archbishop has 7, and the Abbot ofSt. Austin's 14 for exchange of the ccutle ; and there arestill 212 burgesses over whom the king has sac and soc.A monk of the church of Canterbury has seized twohouses of two burgesses, one without, the other within thecity. These were situated in the king's way.The burgesses had 46 mansions without the city, fromwhich they received rent and custom. But the king hadsac and soc. The burgesses also had themselves 33 acresof land from the king for their Guild. These houses andthis land Ralph de Columbus holds.He has also, besides these, 80 acres of land, which the bur-fol.3.76 CANTERBURY.Domciday. gegges held socially from the king. He has five more acresKent, which justly belong to the church alone. For all these thisRalph appeals to the Bishop of Bayeux for protection.Ralph de Curbespine has four mansions in the city, whicha concubine of Harold's held;— of these the sac and soc isthe king's, but till now he had it not.The same Ralph holds 1 1 other mansions of the Bishopof BaieuXy in the very city.Throughout the whole city of Canterbury the king hadsac and soc, except the land of the church of the HolyTrinity and St. Austin, and others.It is agreed concerning the highways that have entranceinto the city and exit, that whoever incurs a forfeituretherein shall make ransom to the king. And so concerningthe highways without the city, for one league three perchesand three feet. If any one therefore in these public ways,within the city or without, shall dig a trench, or erect apaling, the reeve of the king shall follow him whithersoeverhe fleet, and shall receive satisfaction for the king's use.The Archbishop claims the forfeitures in the roads withoutthe city on every side within his awn land.A certain reeve in the time of King Edward, by nameTruman, collected customs from foreign merchants in theland of the Holy Trinity and St. Austin, who afterwards, inthe reign of King William, acknowledged before Lanfranc theArchbishop, and the Bishop of Bayeux, that he had receivedthe same unjustly, and swore on his oath that these churchesthemselves had their customs free in the time offing Edward,And from this period both churches have received theirown customs within their land, by the judgment of the baronsof the king who held the plea.Fol. 2, B.

There is also at the head of the lands of the Archbishop ofCanterbury, the following entry : — " In the city of Canterbury ,the archbishop has 12 burgesses and 33 houses, which theclerks of the town hold for their guild."JCANTERBURY. 77Fifty-two houses in the city of Canterbury, are stated to ^^^^•^r -have belonged, in the time of King Edward, to the manor of ^et^t.£stursete, which the Archbishop held in his demesne of KingEdward ; but now they are not, except 26, because the othersare destroyed in the new palace of the Archbishop.- In the entry of the town of Saint Martin, which is stated FoI. 4.to belong to Estursete, it is said, that seven burgesses inCanterbury belonged to that land.And amongst the lands of the monks of the Archbishop, in FoI. 5.the entry of Nordevde, it is stated, that 100 burgesses lessthree, in the city of Canterbury belonged to that manor.And amongst the lands of the bishop of Bayeux, it is stated, foI. 8.that 2 manses of hmds in Canterbury belonged to the manorof Otringedene. And also a house in Canterbury, in the timeof King Edward, belonged to the manor of Westselve. Andthe three houses in Canterbury, in the time of King Edward,belonged to the manor of Winchester. And three houses foI. 9.in Canterbury belonged to the manor of Wickham.And that Adam Fitzhubert has of the bishop, in the hun yo, 9, b.dred and city of Canterbury, four houses ; and two withoutthe city.

Itestablishes also to demonstration, that the burgess-ship. did not depend upon tenure : — ^because if it did, they wouldhave altogether belonged to those several manors, which it isclear they did not, — ^for they are called burgesses of Canterburyy and they could not be burgesses of Canterbury byvirtue of tenure, because they did not hold of it; — but theywere burgesses of Canterbury by virtue of their resiancy^and of their being inhabitant householders there.These passages therefore of Domesday, with the numerousothers which pervade almost every page, are abundant todestroy the generally prevalent opinion that hur^ess-shiwas connected with tenures And, on the contrary theyestablish the doctrine, that it was founded upon resinousAnother current opinion is also equally negatived by theseentries, viz. that burgess-ship depended upon tenure of th eking, as tenants in ancient demesne or otherwise — becausethis entry of Canterbury shews, that, of the 231 burgesses19 only h eld of the king. In the entry of the archbishop'slands, it is stated, that he had 12 burgesses in the city, sevenof them (being part of the 32), belonged in the time of theConfessor to the king, and then paid rent to him. Thesehad by some means been alienated by the crown, and tiedcome into the possession of the archbishop ; — but they wereoriginally a lay fee ; — and we shall have occasion to observehereafter, that those lands only which originally belonged tothe Church were exempt, but not subsequently acquired property; therefore, the seven houses which had been alienatedby the king to the archbishop ceased, as is stated in thecommencement of the entry, to pay rent or gable to theking; — but they were still subject to lay jurisdiction, andthe sac and soc of the king : consequently those householderswho resided in them, would be subject to do suit and serviceat the Court Leet in respect of this resiancy; and wouldthereby be made burgesses, although they were tenants ofthe archbishop holding a lay fee.This important view of the subject is confirmed by theCANTERBURY. 79distinction which arises from another part of this entry, Domesday.relative to the abbot of Saint Augustine : whose possessions Kent.we may remember, are declared to be exempt from the socand sac of the king. It appears that the abbot had taken14 burgesses (i. e. of course, their houses) in exchange for thesite of the castle, which, as we have had occasion to observebefore, would be separate and distinct from the city, andtherefore would confer no burgess-ship. So also, the 14houses received by the abbot in exchange, not being merelya newly acquired possession, but a substitution for thatwhich he had, would be taken subject to the same exemptionsas the land which the abbot had given for it, and thekkig would hold the site of the castle which he had inexchange, subject to lay jurisdiction and lay liabilities;for otherwise the object of both parties in the exchangewould not have been carried into effect.The result of which is — the king would take the castle,to do with it as he liked ; but, being separate from the city,no burgess-ship could be connected with it. The abbotwould take the 14 houses as a substitution for that withwhich he had parted, and therefore subject to ecclesiasticaljurisdiction, and entitled to ecclesiastical exemptions; and,consequently, the abbot does not appear, in the entry of hislands, to have any burgesses in the City of Canterbury,which he otherwise would, if the 14 houses had not beenexempted.The seven houses thus entered having afforded a clue tothe understanding of this matter, it is no strained inferenceto assume, that the remaining five burgesses belonging tothe archbishop stood in the same predicament; particularlyas the 25 houses in the manor of Estursete, the remainder ofthe 62 houses there, held in demesne by the archbishop inthe time of King Edward, do not appear to have any burgessesotherwise the number of the archbishop's burgesses musthave exceeded 12. We have, therefore, another evidentdistinction with respect to burgesses, between the possessionswhich were the archbishop's ancient demesne, and thosewhich were of recent acquisition. The archbishop appears80 CANTERBURY.Dome«itoy. ^jg^ ^ j^j^^^ 33 other houses in the city, with respect to whichKent, no burgesses are spoken of, and therefore some reason mustbe assigned why the inhabitants of those houses should notbe burgesses. It seenls apparent upon the face of the entry,for they are described as clerks or ecclesiastics. Theyhad, therefore, a clear ground of personal exemptions, againestablishing the distinction between the laity and the ecclesiastics,to which we have had, and shall have, frequentoccasion to refer. The clerks had their houses towards thepayment for their guild, which they, as ecclesiastics, wouldrender to the church.On the other hand, the seven burgesses mentioned in theentry of the town of Saint Martin must have been lay persons,and not ecclesiastics, and therefore were, by theirresidence in Canterbury, bound to do their suit royal at theCourt Leet of the borough, although they were new tenantsof the Archbishop of Saint Martin, and as such bound to dotheir suit civil, or of tenure, at the Court Baron of thearchbishop. The 97 burgesses of the manses of the Archbishop,who held of the manor of Nordevde, are subjectto the same observation: but the manses of lands, and thehouses in Canterbury held of the Bishop of Bayeux, of themanors of Otringedene, Wickham, Cilleham, Westselve,Winchester, Spring, Molten, Pere, Trevelyan, Dodeham,Lanport and Neptune, must have been held by personsexempt from burgess-ship, as ecclesiastics — females — minorsaliens — Jews — strangers — or the villains of some otherlord, which observation will also apply to the four housesheld by Adam de Fitzhubert. As to the two houses whichhe has without the city — ^they are to be referred, like those atthe commencement of the entry, which were similarly situated,to the extension of the jurisdiction over the liberties in thesuburbs. The lands which Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux, hadtaken from the burgesses, was probably an old ecclesiasticalfee which he had resumed.Before concluding these remarks upon the entries respectingCanterbury, it may be requisite to observe, with referenceto the guild, that in the reign of William II. there was a mer-canterbury.81chant guild there, which gave up eight houses within Burgage i^«»<»*iay'to the convent of Saint Augustine, who transferred other Kent.houses in exchange for them : — but it will be seen hereafterthat it was distinct from burgess-ship, as only a portion of theburgesses belonged to it; and it has been already shown,that the Guild of the Clerks of Canterbury was altogetherseparate from burgess-ship, as they were not burgesses.The extracts from Domesday, relative to Canterbury,supply a variety of information respecting the early conditionof the place, — sits burgesses, — ^and the several classes ofsociety within it. The citizens are not mentioned. It iscalled a city.* And, as we have observed before, all citiesare boroughs ; — ^and, therefore, we find the burgesses of Canterbury,here spoken of as having existed in the time ofEdward the Confessor. And as burgesses then paid gablumor house rent to King Edward, it is clear that they werehouseholders. Which further appears, from the mention ofthe reduction of the number of those who paid rent to 19 ; —the remaining 32 houses, making together the 61 mentionedm the time of King Edward, having been destroyed, — aconsiderable portion of them being in the ditch of the city,which is said to have been 150 feet broad ;i- as shown by arecord in the 18th of Edward I., in a suit between the archbishopand the city, who then claimed it, to be of that width.Fourteen others had been transferred to the abbot, in exchangefor the site of the castle. Those, becoming ecclesiasticalproperty, would be freed from the payment tothe king. The 212 other persons, mentioned in the beginningof the entry, as those over whom the king had socand sac, are, in a subsequent part, called burgesses. It isclear, that some part of the city was held of the king;and that over the rest of it, which was held of other persons,"1 .and from which, therefore, he was not entitled to house rent,>•or gablum, he had only sac and soc, i. e. jurisdiction as lord.A tenn borrowed, as it seems, by the Ecclesiastics from the Civil Law, andapplied by them to those places where their great Ecclesiastical establishments weresettled ; — but the boroughs were so called, from the Saxons borrowing both theirname and their jurisdiction, from the ancient common law.t Somner's Hist, of Cant. 17.VOL. I. a82 CANTERBURY.DoraesUay. YliBt the bui^csses weir householders, is also fisLrtherNeat. confirmed, by the mention of two burgesses in connection withtheir houses which had been seized by the monk. It is true,that one of these is stated to be without the city ; and, generallyspeaking, the rights and privileges of a borough wereconfined to its limits : — so that this instance of a burgess'shouse being without the city would, at first sight, appear tomilitate against the doctrine, that all burgesses ought to beresident. But the jurisdiction and liberties of a boroughwere rarely confined within the ambit of its walls, the libertiesextending far beyond, as is well known in the instanceof the city of London, and will hereafter be established bymany others. In this case it is perfectly clear, that thejurisdiction did extend beyond the walls ; because it appearsthat the burgesses had 45 mansions, expressly described aswithout the city, from which they received rent, and which,therefore, were not in their possession, but over which, theking's borough jurisdiction, or his soc and sac, extended ; —thus distinctly establishing, that the jurisdiction spread beyondthe city.The burgesses had also certain lands for or towards theirguild, i. e. certain lands to enable them to make good theirguild, or payments to the king.Ralph de Columbus was the tenant, both of th housesand lands of the burgesses. He held some land of the church,and is stated to appeal to the Bishop of Bayeux as his lord.This might appear, at first view, in some degree to militateagainst the doctrine, with respect to burgesses, that has beenbefore urged ; — ^because if he were a householder within theborough, he would have been a burgess ; which, on the otherhand, he would not be, if he were a man of the bishop : — thewhole would turn upon his residence.If he rented land of the bishop, which it appears he did,and lived upon it, he was entitled to claim his protection.Now, although he held the houses and lands of the burgesses,there is nothing to shew that he resided uponthem ; and therefore, no inference can be drawn that he wasbound to be a burgess, or that there was anything to pre-rochester.g3rent him from placing himself under the protection of the Domesday.bishop. In that point of view it is clear, that the burgess-ship Kent.did not depend upon tenure ; for if so, Columbus must havebeen a burgess, because he held largely of the city : but itdid depend upon '^ reticence" And for the reasons beforeniger, it is fair to presume, that he resided upon the lands ofthe bishop, to whom he had attached himself as his lord.The 1 1 mansions held of the bishop would, as ecclesiasticalproperty, be exempt from the jurisdiction of the king ;which is evident, both from the four mansions held by theconcubine of Harold, being subject to the soc and sac ofthe king, and those of the Holy Trinity, St. Augustine, andthe other churches, being exempt from it : — as well as thatthe archbishop had the forfeitures of the roads without thecity, within his own land, although the king had the others,and the church of the Holy Trinity and St. Augustine wereadjudged to be entitled to the custom of foreign merchants,payable in their own lands. The provisions respecting thehighways — the forfeiture — and the king's peace, will recallthe recollection of the reader to the Saxon Laws, as well asthe mention of the Mng^B reeve, who appears to have beenthe officer presiding over Canterbury from the earliest times.For in a charter dated at Canterbury, ^^ Attune" is mentionedas the " Prefect" (or " Reeve **) of the city.* And in956, to a deed of sale of a piece of land in Canterbury,** Bolthwig" subscribes himself amongst the witnesses asPortgerefa:" — and the king's reeve is about the same timementioned as one of the prisoners who were there taken.ROCHESTER.At the close of the entry of Canterbury, we find the city Fol. 2,of Rochester mentioned. In the time of King Edward itwas valued at lOOs. when the bishop received it; now itis worth 20Z., nevertheless he who holds it renders 40/.We have also the following entries respecting Rochester.Five burgesses in Rochester belonged to the archbishop's Fol. 3.manor of Tarente.9 Somner's Hist, of Cant. 178.g284 ROCHESTER.Domesday. fj^g Bishop of Rochester had and now has in RochesterKent, fourscore mansions, which belonged to Frandesberie andFoi. 5, B. Borestele, his own proper manors.Fol. 7. And three houses in Rochester, of 31d. which he took ofthe manor of Aiglessa into his own hands.Also the bishop holds in his own hands, within the city ofRochester, four houses belonging to the manor of Ledesdune.Also in demesne, one house in the city of Rochester, ofthe manor of Ofeham.Fol. 8, B. Also nine houses in the city of Rochester, which belongedto the manor of How.Also four houses in the city belonging to Otringebei^e.Fol. 9. And the bishop hath retained in his hands, three houses inthe city of Rochester, which are entered as of the manor ofCelia.Rochester is in these entries called a citt/f upon whichwe have already observed with respect to Canterbury. Itappears to have been held by the bishop; — but that itwas a lay fee, acquired by him subsequent to the reignof King Edward. Five burgesses in the borough are statedto belong to the manor of Tarente. They must have beenhouseholders, having houses within the city of Rochesterbelonging to the archbishop's manor of Tarente, where theypaid their rent. These burgesses are subjected to the sameobservations as those of the archbishop's in Canterbury.The many mansions in Rochester belonging to the manor ofFrandesberie and Borestele, with respect to which no burgessesare mentioned — also the houses there, and those of themanor of Aiglessa; — the four belonging to Ledesdune, andthe one belonging to Ofeham, where there is also no referenceto burgesses — appear all to belong to manors inthe actual possession of the bishop. Frandesberie and Bore-styleare expressly stated to be his own proper manors.Aiglessa and Ledesdune are described as being in his ownhands, and Ofeham, as his demesne. They and theirtenants would therefore be exempt from all borough dutiesand burgess-ship, as being the property and men of thebishop.SANDWICH. j^5The three houses entered under the manor of Celia, are Pop'g»<J«y-also expressly stated to be retained in the hands of the Kent,bishop.The nine belonging to How, and the four to Stringerare not described as being the demesne, or in theactual possession of the bishop. — But the question is,whether, as that fsLct is so distinctly proved with respect tothe others, the conclusion from it is not obvious, that thesehouses should be considered as being in the same situation,although not expressly stated: — remembering always thatthe great object of this return was to establish the profitand value of the property, which was invariably entered :and not to define what were the liabilities, or exemptionsfix)m it, with respect to lay or ecclesiastical jurisdictions, andwhich, therefore, were frequently omitted.Immediately succeeding the entry of Rochester are thepossessions of Saint Martin, in which the Community ofSaint Martin is repeatedly mentioned ; and, perhaps, theymight have been a corporation, as such ecclesiastical bodieswere incorporated from the earliest times. In truth, they hadnothing but their incorporation to unite them ; for they were Inot bound to act together for the support, defence, or civil I / ^,government of the place, as a general body of inhabitants / ""were by the law compelled to do : — but they were a body ^united only by their incorporation.SANDWICH.The next entry material for observation is that of Sandwich, Fol. 3.which is stated to lie in its own proper hundred, and that thearchbishop held the borough for the clothing of the monks.And it renders the like service to the king as Dover. — thisthe men of the same borough testify ; that, before King Edwardgave it to the Holy Trinity, it rendered to the king £15 — atthe time of the death of King Edward it was not at farm, whenthe archbishop received it. In the time of King Edwardthere were there 307 mansions, and now there are 76 more;together 383. This was a large population for Sandwich atthat period. We must observe of this place, as we have before86 MAIDSTONE.— ROMNEY.Domesday. of Dover, that it is not mentioned as a cinque port : — but it isKent, stated that it renders the like services to the king as Dover,which was a large supply of ships and men. It is describedas lying in its own proper hundred. And it will be seenhereafter that it was a hundred of itself, and a hundredcourt was regularly held there, as shown by the custumal.It is singular that the burgesses of Sandwich are not describedby that name. It is, however, clear that it was a borough,and must therefore have had burgesses ; and it is byno means unimportant to remark, that they are here calledthe men of the borough: — ^a term which we shall find constantlyapplied in the same manner, from the earliest chartersto the Tudor dynasty. We must also note, that this was notan ancient ecclesiastical fee of the archbishop's, but belongedto King Edward, and was only received by the archbishopafter that king's death.It is a striking circumstance connected with Sandwich,that not only is the inference almost irresistible from theseentries in Domesday, that the inhabitant householders werethe burgesses in the time of William the Conqueror, but alsoin so distant a period as the reign of Charles U., whena new charter was granted to Sandwich, expressly incorporatingthe '^ inhabitants'*MAIDSTONE.Foi. 3. Maidstone is mentioned as held of the archbishop. It isnot described as a borough, but merely as a manor.ROMNEY.In a subsequent part of the entry of Kent, we find Romneydescribed under the name of Romenel. The burgesses arespoken of as fourscore: five of them being stated to belongto the archbishop's manor of Clinton.In the entry of the manor of Lanport, which was held byRobert de Romenel, of the archbishop, there are said tobelong to that manor 21 burgesses in Romenel, of whom theFol. 4. B. archbishop hath the three forfeitures of theft — breach of thepeace — ^and forestalling — but the king has all service fromRomney. 87them, and they themselves have all the customs, and the Do°><^"^y-other forfeitures, for the service of the sea: and they are in Kent.the hands of the king — and in the time of King Edward,and since, it was worth 10 Z., and now 16 Z.Again, under the Bishop of Bayeux, lands in LanportHundred, in the entry of the lands which Robert de Romenelholds of the Bishop, it is said, the same Robert has 50burgesses in the Borough of Romenel : and the king has allservice of them : and they are quit by this service of the seaof all custom except three — theft — breach of the peace —and forestalling.Such are the entries with respect to Romney. As to the85 burgesses or householders in Romney, which belonged tothe mAnor of Clinton, it seems that they were not in thedemesne, or the actual possession of the archbishop, because,in a subsequent entry of the manor, that part of itwhich is in Limes is expressly stated to be in his demesne.The negative inference therefore arises, that the others werenot, which renders the entry of the burgesses consistent withthe general law, — and this view of the subject is corroboratedby the next entry respecting the 21 burgesses whichbelonged to the archbishop's manor of Lanport, for they arenot in demesne, but held by Robert de Romenel.And the burgesses only owed partial service to the archbishop,as far as forfeiture for theft, breach of the peace, andforestalling extended ; but all other service belonged to theking, and all customs to themselves, in consequence of theirservice of the sea ; which was no doubt the same as that ofDover and Sandwich, although it is not here mentioned, as inthe case of Sandwich.The subsequent entry is little more than a repetition of theformer, excepting that it speaks of the 50 burgesses belongingto Robert de Romenel; which, added to the 85, and 21tered before, make together 156.In conclusion, we should observe with respect to Romney,that although its service at sea to the king is mentioned, it isnot described as one of the cinque ports.HYTHE./Do mesday, Hythe is also mentioned in Domesday, and its burgesses ;Kent, six of whom, described as in Hede, are stated to belong tothe archbishop's manor of Meninges.The manor itself is stated to be in demesne; and the numberof villains and bordarii, and their possessions. Thenfollows the clichy which could not be in demesne ; but it isnot so mentioned. After which, succeeds the entry as to theburgesses ; and they not being described as being in demesne,must, for the reasons we have given before, be assumed not tobe so. This is the more probable, because immediately afterfollows an entry of some land of this manor, which washeld by three men of the archbishop, not in demesne, butwho were also stated to have held other lands' and villainsin demesne. Indeed, generally speaking, it may be observed,that where villains are mentioned it is usually udth respect tolands held in demesne* Two hundred and twenty-five burgessesin the borough of Hythe, expressly described as beingwithin the borough, are stated to belong to the manor ofSalted (Atwood), which was held by Hugh de Montfort,of the archbishop; and is the parish in which Hythe issituated.These altogether make 231 burgesses; and as they areall described emphatically, as being within the borough, itraises a strong inference that none but burgesses were inhabitants;— ^a conclusion which is confirmed by the subsequentcharters granted^to this place, particularly that of Hen. IV., —the bye laws, — the admission of barons,-^~and the recordswhich speak of them as ^' dwelling within the town, householders,resiantSy and in-dwellers'' The charter of the 17th ofQueen Elizabeth, expressly speaks of the barons and inhabitantshaving enjoyed privileges from time immemorial, andincorporates them ; subsequently to which, persons aredisfranchised and dismissed from offices, because they haddeparted from the town, and removed their dwellings from thetown elsewhere, living out of the liberty for more than a yearand a day : — those only who paid scot and lot being unquestionablythe persons to be admitted, as was expressly statedat an assembly in 1707, the 6th of Queen Anne.SESELTRE. ^9And yet in 1710, upon the question being brought before ^o" *^'*^^'-a committee of the House of Commons, whether the mayor, i^ent.jurats, common council, and free men (which in fact includednon-residents as well as residents), had the right ofelection ; or, whether it was in such of them only who inhabitedin the port, and paid scot and lot ; — the committee, onTery loose evidence, purely negative, and only spoken to forafew years, decided, — that it was in the mayor, jurats, commoncouncil, and freemen, (and the House adopted thatdecision.) Thus letting in the b8W residents, who everafterwards in act controlled the election.It seems that it was in respect of the manor of Salted,which belonged to the archbishop, that he appointed thebailiff of this borough, until 1639,-31 Hen. VIII., whenthe archbishop exchanging the manor and the bailiwickof Hythe with the king for estates elsewhere, the archbishopceased to appoint.Lord Coke states,* that Hythe was made one of the cinqueports by William the Conqueror. Put this may be reasonablyquestioned, as in this record, which was made at theclose of his reign, it is not mentioned as one of the cinqueports, nor is there, as in the cases of Sandwich, Dover, andRomney, any mention of its service at sea to the king.Neither does it appear as connected with the cinque ports,unto 1400,-2 Hen. IV.SESELTRE.In the return of Kent, in the Lest of Borowart, there is an Fol. 5«entry sufficiently peculiar to require observation. It is stated,that there is in that lest a small borough called Seseltre,or Seashore, which properly belongs to the kitchen of thearchbishop, and a man of the name of Blaze holds it of themonks.In all periods of our history, it appears that there havebeen some places which have been boroughs, and which havesubsequently ceased to be so. Throughout Domesday, andparticularly in the county of Kent, and the succeeding• Inst. iv. 222.90 SESELTRE.Domesday. coQiity of Sussex, many of the hundreds have the addition ofKent, boroughs, and probably were originally of that description,but at the time of the survey did not exist as such ; and theconverse also frequently occurs, as many boroughs werecreated subsequent to the survey. When we consider thevarying fluctuations of population, this is not to be wonderedat — and as the accumulation of inhabitants in a particularspot was the real cause of the establishment of a borough —so, when on any account population took another course, itwas but reasonable that the borough should cease to have itsseparate and distinct jurisdiction; and that other places,where population had increased, should acquire these necessaryand peculiar privileges, and have separate establishments ;and such has always been the practice of our constitution.No burgesses of this place are spoken of: — ^and, therefore,it may be assumed that there were none : whichinference is confirmed by the Bordarii being mentioned.The causes which led to the borough being reduced, it isnow probably difficult to trace ; but at all events there isthis peculiarity connected with this place, that it belongedto the personal services of the archbishop, and it was heldof the monks — ^and the land appears to have been in demesne.All of which are sufficient reasons for losing its populationand civil lay importance.Besides which, it is by no means impossible that theremay not be a precise meaning in the peculiar phrase,propria pertinent," — it might have assumed to be a borough,without any legal authority — and this expression may beintended to convey the idea that, although such had been thecase, it was, in fact, the proper ecclesiastical possession ofthe archbishop.Norwich.Fol. 12. There is also another small borough mentioned, which mayperhaps, in a great degree, come under the same observations,as it is stated that the abbot holds it. It is called ^'Forewic,"and the entry is, that King Edward had given two parts ofthe borough to Saint Augustine ; but the one-third part, whichNorwich. 91belonged to Godwin, the Bishop of Bayeux granted to the PMP<»'*y-same saint, — King William agreeing to it. There were 100 Kent.manses of lands, four less, rendering 13 shillings : now thereare 73 manses only remaining. In the time of King Edwardand since, it was worth 100 shillings: now 11 pounds andtwo shillings. Twenty-four acres of land Saint Augustinealways had. There, then, were, and are, six burgesses,rendering 22 shillings. In that borough Lanfranc, thearchbishop, holds seven manses of land, which, in thetime of King Edward, served Saint Augustine: now thearchbishop has taken away that service to him.This borough appears to have been dismantled, by beingdivided, and held in three different parcels ;. the whole atlast being held by the abbot, though a part of it had beforebeen held by Earl Godwin; which seems to explain thedifference between this borough, and the one to which welast referred. For in that case, the whole was said to haveproperly belonged to the archbishop; and no burgessesare mentioned : here, a part had belonged to Earl Godwin,as a lay fee ; and if there were any inhabitants upon it,they would have been burgesses, who would continue such,notwithstanding the property came into the ecclesiasticalhands. And, therefore, we find that there were, and are, sixburgesses.It is true, that the entry is, that Saint Augustine alwayshad the 23 acres where the six burgesses were. But if thisis a part of the borough, it is inconsistent with the formerstatement ; because from that it appears, that Saint Augustinehad neither of the three parts of the borough till the time ofKing Edward and King William. And if it were not a partof the borough, it is difficult to see how they would be burgesses.It seems, therefore, difficult to explain this passage,in which there must be some mistake or inaccuracy.92 CHICHESTER.Domesday.^"*^*- SUSSEX.CHICHESTER, HASTINGS,NEW BOROUGH, Sterling,LEWES, ARUNDEL,PEVEN8EY.Although there were nine Parliamentary boroughs in Sussex,besides the cinque ports of Hastings — Winchelsea — Rye —and Seaford, it is worthy of observation, that not one of them isFol.16. separately entered in this survey. — In the first and secondcolumns, however, there are considerable blanks, in which itis probable that one or more were intended to have been entered; but which of them it is now impossible to determine.Chichester — Lewes — Hastings — Steyning — Arundel — areall mentioned; but not Shoreham — Fordham — Chamber —Midhurst — Grinstead — ^nor any other of the cinque ports —unless the * new borough' introduced in the 17th, or the 20burgesses entered in the 18th foL, but not described asbelonging to any particular borough, can be referred to eitherof those places. Besides these, 110 burgesses in Pevenseyoccur.Fol. 26. The castle only of Chamber is described as being situatedin one of the hides of the manor of Wasingetune, which paidfor 59 hides in the time of King Edward, but now does notgive Geld — probably on account of the castle being within it.CHICHESTER.Fol. 16. Chichester is the borough first mentioned amongst the demesnesof the king — and under the manor of Boreas, it isstated, that 11 hague in Chichester belonged, in the time ofKing Edward, to that manor : but that the bishop now hath10 of them from the king, and one of them only is in theFol. 17, B. manor. As belonging to Falcheham, part of the possessions ofthe land of the Abbey of Saint Edward, are entered six bur-fol.23. gesses in Chichester. In the city of Chichester, in the time,of King Edward, there were 100 hagee, two and a-half less,and three crofts. Now the city itself is in the hands of EarlCHICHESTER. 93Roger, and there are in the same manses 60 houses more domesday.than there were before. And under the same Earl Roger are Sussex.held 66 hagee in Chichester, in 18 different manors. ^^Id^h!And in the manor of Headache are entered three burgessesin Chichester. There are, therefore, only nine burgessesaltogether of this city incidentally mentioned. Ninety-ninehague occur: — but notwithstanding they are spoken of asplaces where men resided or remained, (manent) yet it seemsvery questionable, whether they were such houses as paidScot and Lot, and made the occupiers liable to bear theburdens, and entitled to share the benefits of burgess-ship. Ifso, the discrepancy between the number of hagee and theburgesses is easily accounted for— but it seems difficult toexplain what half a haga could be ; — and in a subsequentpart of the entry it is clear, that both hague and manses,(naturae) are distinguished from houses. — For they are allthree mentioned in the same entry, and it is said, that, Fol.23.in the same manses there are 60 houses more than therewere before.In these entries as to Chichester, there is less to connectthe burgesses with their houses than in those of the otherplaces which we have before investigated : — and in the reignof King Stephen there is a confirmation to the burgesses ofChichester of their guild merchant, with all their ancientcustoms. Notwithstanding the negative inference arisingfrom this want of connection between the burgesses and theirhouses, — and the affirmative proof, which in the estimationof some persons would arise from the existence of so ancienta guild merchant, — ^yet the burgesses were, in 1660, mostclearly defined to be the inhabitants: — the contest then being,whether the free citizens alone, or the commonalty at large,ought, as burgesses, to elect the representatives in Parliament,and it was decided in favour of the latter. It appearing,upon view of the books of the city, that for 21 parliaments,the commonalty, as well as the citizens, had a voice in theelection, and therefore the committee so determined; and theHouse ordered the mayor into the custody of the serjeant-alarms,because he had disregarded several ancient prestLewes.Domesday . cedent that had been offered unto him, to establish the rightSussex. Qf the commonalty, and had refused to admit the voices ofthe commonalty; — ^which was described by the Speaker '^ as awilful contempt of the authority of the House, and in breachof his trust." And in 1710, there was a petition of the candidates,freeholders, inhabitants and temporary freemen, toestablish this right, but it was unsuccessful; and the burgessesvoting for members of Parliament have been longconsidered to be, the inhabitant householders, paying scotand lot.As members had been returned to Parliament for thisplace from the 23d year of Edw. L, and nothing has ever occurredeither before or subsequent to the period, to alter theclass of persons who were the burgesses, it is obvious theymust always have been those we have described.LEWES.The next Borough we find mentioned in Domesday isLewes ; and although the entries respecting it do not conveymuch information upon the subject of our inquiry, the shorthistory of this place will be important, as explanatory of thesimple nature of the original borough rights under the commonlaw, before they were complicated by usurped usages,or by the perversion of the charters of the crown.Fol, 16, B. But to proceed with our extracts from the survey.-r-Thearchbishop had in Lewes 21 hags belonging to the manorof Meninges — the bishop of Chichester three — ^and there arebesides these 100 others, altogether 124.We have before observed as to Chichester, the half of ahaga returned — there is here an instance of the entry of thethird part, and another of three parts of a his ; the formerin the manor of Wintrebume, the latter in Wicha.It appears also from these entries, that a haga was notmerely land inclosed ; because, in the manor of Pinhedene,two hags and a meadow of land are mentioned. In one ha is stated to render nothing.Fol. 26. The borough of Lewes is entered under the possessionsof William de Warene ; — sits gable rent and toll arei.EWES. 96stated. King Edward is described as having had there, in ^^""^y-demegfie (in dominion) 127 burgesses ; and their custom was, Sussex.that if the king wished to send his own men, there was collectedof all the men, of whomsoever the lord might be, 20«,,which those had who kept arms in the ships. Provisionsfollow as to the payments to be made to the reeve, upon thepurchase and sale of cattle in the borough. And as to theamercements and payments for manslaughter — adultery —rape — flight — and coining;— of all these, two parts belongedto the king, and the third to the earl.Besides the burgesses of the king, three are stated toFoi.]6,B.belong to the bishop's manor of Hafelde; ten to the manor Fol.i7,B.of Suisse, part of the possessions of Saint Peter of Winchester;seven to Alsistone, of the church of Battel, of ^^'•^'''»^-the manor of Childetune; 26 of the manor of Newode; Foi. 27.and six in demesne, belonging to his manor of Declines ; — Fol. 26.which last entry is connected also with one of 11 mansesin Lewes; from which it would seem, as we have shewnbefore, that every manse might not produce a burgess; becausethey might either be the men of some other lord, — orvillains — or ecclesiastics, &c. &c.The number of burgesses in the time of King Edward,appears to have been 127 : at the period of the survey, only53. It is clear, that those who were there in the reign of KingEdward, were householders, as they paid gable rent.Observations have already been made, with respect to theburgesses belonging to different manors. But the strikingfeature of this place, appears in its subsequent history : — enchanteris found to have been granted to it; — ^nor was anymayor ever created. And although the reeve is mentioned,his office was either simply as the bailiff of Williamde Warene's manor; and therefore not the officer of the king; —or the office was subsequently discontinued : for it seemsthat the constables, the common law officers, who ought tobe appointed at the Court Leet, alone preside in the place.The only usurpation which appears to have occurred atLewes is, that thane, by confounding the Court Leet and theCourt Baron together (an abuse very frequent), the constables96 LEWES.Domesday. have been elected at the latter, instead of the former. WithSussex, this exception, Lewes appears to have continued in itsoriginal state : and it is a singular eulogy upon the simplicityof our early institutions, that Lewes has produced scarcelyany disputes or litigation ; and the name of this town isalmost unknown to our early legal records.With the same certainty as to its parliamentary privileges,although it had returned members from the 23rd of Edward I.,no question had arisen as to the right of election there, till1628 ; when the return being disputed, it was argued to bein the inhabitants. And a further parliamentary inquiryarising in the year 1736, the right was determined to be in theinhabitant householders, paying scot and lot.Glanville. Although, therefore, these entries in Domesday, likethose of Chichester, afford us little information upon thesubject, yet the simple perverted history of this placeestablishes to demonstration the doctrine adopted by thecelebrated Committee in the reign of James the first, thatof common right — all Inhabitants — Householders — Resiantswithin the Boroughs have the right of Election as Burgesses.Yet Brady, who wrote in 1690, and who either did, orought, to have known of the agreement as to the right ofElection, which had been entered upon the Journals of theHouse of Commons in 1628, quotes in his Book, written for• the purpose of establishing the exclusive right in those whomhe called the Community or Select Body of the Corporationthe passage which we have above extracted with respectto Lewes, and draws from the expression (in dominion) theinference, that the Burgesses of Lewes were in immediatesubjection to King Edward: — or in other terms, were hisvassals. A construction which the word will in no degreeadmit — but on the contrary, it merely implies, that they helddirectly of the king in capite, and not of any intermediatelord — and as they held by Burgage or Free Tenure, theywere not vassals but free men; and residing there, werethe free men, resiant inhabitants — householders — ^swom —enrolled and paying scot and lot, and as such, " Burgesses."HASTINGS.-STEYNING. 97Domesday,HASTINGS. Suez.The entry as to Hastings is very short, and merely showsthat four burgesses held of the abbey of Feschamp, as partof the manor of Amelia. We shall therefore postpone thiscase until the reign of William III., when an important ^®®'question arose as to its parliamentary rights; and, in 1736, ^^^*an inquiry into the municipal privileges was instituted, upona mandamus at the suggestion of Mr. Henry Moore, whoclaimed admission as a freeman.ffSterling.The entry with respect to Steyning is also brief and un ssatisfactory. It is stated that the abbot holds it : — but inthe commencement of the entry there is no mention of theBorough or Burgesses. After specifying the possessions of ^o^* lethemanor, it is added, in the Borough there were 118manses, now there are 123.In the time of King Edward they worked at the lord'shall (curiam) as villains.From the latter part of this passage it would appear, thatthose who lived in Steyning in the time of King Edwardwere not freemen hut villains : and therefore would not belargesses. Whether those who inhabited the manses continuedto do that service, and therefore were not enteredas burgesses, it is difficult now to say : — but Steyning willhereafter afford us sufficient matter for observation, whenthe extraordinary and varying decisions of the House ofCommons, as to the parliamentary right of election in 1701, ^^^}>j}P^'1710, 1716, 1791 and 1792, come under our consideration. 1791,1792.In the first two of which the right was determined in theInhabitants paying Scot and Lot : — the two succeeding inthe Burgage holders : — the latter being a decision under thejurisdiction created by the " Grenville Act :" and upon anappeal by the same authority in that year, the right wasfinally established in the Inhabitant Householders paying 1792,Scot and Lot: — ^wbich therefore ought, like Lewes, to betakenas the original general definition of a Burgess ofVOL. I, H98 ARUNDRL.—PEVENSEY.Domesday. Steyning — with the addition of the qualifications requiredSussex. by law, i. e. being of free condition, and therefore sworn andenrolled.Fol. 23.ARUNDEL.The entry as to Arundel, is somewhat more particularthan the last ; but still affords little material information.The castle only seems to have existed in the time of KingEdward ; and it rendered for a mill, three entertainments ;and also for a pasture : altogether four pounds. At the timeof the survey, with the borough and the port, and the customfrom the ships, it rendered lOZ., and was worth 13/.It appears therefore to have increased in value ; whichprobably arose from its having been in the mean time createda borough. Robert Fitz Theobald is stated to have his oventoll of foreign men. More is stated to have the custom oftwo burgesses — Emald one — St. Martin one. These are allthe burgesses who are mentioned ; and they probably occupiedthe houses which they had under the persons specified.From the other parts of the entry it appears, that a burgessand an haga paid the same sum — viz. \2d. each.With respect to this place, also, the parliamentary rightof election has been twice decided, to be in the inhabitants1623. paying scot and lot : — once, in 1623, by the celebrated com-1603. mitteein the reign of James I. ; and again, in 1693, in thereign of William III.PEVENSEY.In the survey of Sussex another borough is mentioned,which does not now exist as a parliamentary borough, exceptingas part of the cinque port of Hastings.There were 24 burgesses stated to be in the demesne ofKing Edward : — as they rendered gable, it is clear that theywere householders. ^The Bishop of Chichester and the priests — Elmer, Ormer,and Odo, the Earl of Morton — and others — are all statedto have had different numbers of burgesses ; amounting inFol.20,B. the whole to 168.GUILDFORD. ' 99As this borough does not afterwards form any particular Domesday.feature in our inquiries we shall abstain from further obser- Sussex.nations respecting it*SURREY.GUILDFORD.In the survey for Surrey, although there were six parliamentaryboroughs, we have no material mention of any butGuildford.At the commencement of the survey, under the TerraRegis, we have a long entry of Gruildford — but it is not FoL 30.named as a borough ; nor is there any mention of its burgesses^—but the persons inhabiting and dwelling in the housesand hags, are simply described by the general appellationof '' homines." King William is stated to have there 75hagee, in which dwelt 176 " men :" — ^firom which it is clearthat more than one man could live upon an haga ; and, consequently,not synonymous with domus, or any other namedenoting individual residence. This is confirmed by thenext material point of the entry, from which it appears thatRanulphus, the clerk, had three hague, where there Used sixmen, and whereof the same Ralph had soc and sac, exceptthe common geld to be laid upon the will — from which nonecould escape ; and to which Guildford, not being a borough,but a part of the county, was liable.The entry proceeds. If a man of his should be guilty ofany crime in the town, and not being in ** pledge " shouldescape, the ^' reeve of the king " hath nothing from thence.But if one shall have been charged there, and shall be inpledge, then the king has his ransom. Ralph, the sheriff,holds one haga, which he hath hitherto holden of theBishop of Bayeux. But ^* the men" testify that it doth notadjoin to any manor ; but he who held it in the time of KingEdward granted it to Tai, reeve of the town, for the ransomof one of his forfeitures.h2iL100 GUILDFORD.Domesday. Xhefc is another house which the reeve of the Bishop ofSurrey. Bayeux holds of the manor of Bronze— of this, the " men ofthe county " say, that he hath not there any other right, exceptthat the reeve of the town received a certain widow,whose house it was ; therefore the bishop appointed the samehouse to his manor, and hitherto the king had the customsof it ; but the bishop now hath them. Also, " the men whohave been shorn" say of another house, which lieth inBronze, that the reeve of the same town was the friend ofthe same man who had this house, and on his death, convertedthe same to his manor of Walerann.In this entry we have a direct reference to the jurisdictionof sac and soc, mentioned in the Saxon laws, which theintermediate lord had over the inhabitants ; also to thecommon geld to which persons here entered as the " men ofthe lands and not as burgesses, in the county at largewere liable ; and likewise to the system of "pferf^e," to whichwe have made such frequent reference in our observationsupon the Saxon institutions.The town appears at this time to have been under thegovernment of the hinges own reeve. The remaining partof the entry is a minute detail of matters, upon which wehave before commented. But the history of this place ispeculiar. It seems to have been reduced to a state of indigence,in the time of Henry II., as in the 19th year of his1172. reign, the aid of the town remained unpaid upon account of• its poverty.1256. In the 41st Hen. III., a charter was given to the *goodmejC' of Guildford, and their " heirs'* granting, that theyand their goods, wherever found, should not be arrested forany debt, for which they were not pledges, or principaldebtors ; unless the debtor should be of their commonalty andtown: they having from whence they could satisfy theirown debts, in whole, or in part, and the said men shouldnot do justice to the said creditors.From this grant to the men and their heirs, it is obvious, asis so well explained by Madox in his Firma Burgh, that theyMag. Rot. 19th Hen. II. Rot. 12, B., Surrey.\GUILDFORD. 101"were not then incorporated. And, although the charter is to Do»wd*y-them in perpetuity, yet, from the numerous authorities Surrey,quoted by Madox, it is clear, that such grants were made, to^ggi^g^^ bodies, as well of counties, hundreds, forests, &c.,and to the clergy and laity, — where there was no pretence forassuming that the grantees could be, or were, incorporated.The object of the grant was to secure the " men" of ^^^Guildford from liability to any debts but their own, andthose of others for whom they had become pledge, accordingto the Saxon system: — ^and who as inhabitant householderswithin their borough, must have had property in it,by which they could be summoned and made responsible,and for whose forthcoming to do right, pledges had beengiven in the Court Leet. ;The liability of the " men of Guildford " therefore, by thischarter, is confined only to the debts of those who are in ' "their commonalty i. e. who are not a part of the commonaltyof the county, but enrolled in their commonalty, at theirborough Court Leet ; and being within their jurisdiction, byhaving within the borough their houses and goods, fromwhich their debts could be satisfied ; so that they would notbe liable for any person who, although he had been of theircommonalty by residence, had ceased to be so, by removinghis house and goods from that place to another ; under thegeneral law, a fresh local responsibility would be cast uponhim, npia his giving fresh pledges in the place of his newadoption. Such a person would be divested of his responsebihty, and of all his rights and privileges, in the borough heleft, and would enjoy them in the place to which he hadremoved his residence.Thus, by the ordinary course of the general law, beingsubject to all responsibilities, and entitled to all privilegeswere necessarily and indispensably connected with actual ^local residence ; and, therefore, we shall find hereafter, withrespect to this place, that all the rights were actually restrainedto the residents.Another charter was also granted in this year to the " good 1256.mew'* and " Acir*;" which shews, that up to this time,/102 • Guildford.^^^**^y- Guildford was not a borough but part of the county ofSurrey. Surrey : for it was directed by the charter, that the CountyCourt of Surrey should for ever be held in this town.However, Guildford must shortly afterwards have becomea borough ; as in that capacity, it returned members to .lament, in the 26th of Edward I.1354. In the 28th of Edward III., it appears from the pleas beforethe Barons of the Exchequer,* that the sub-collectors ofthe tenth and quidem, were charged with partiality, andwith having imposed the taxes unequally upon the people ofGuildford : it being alleged, that those changes ought to beassessed proportionably upon all the men of the place.In confirmation of the observation we have before made,1460. we find, that in the 39th of Henry VL, the persons who asburgesses made the election for Gruildford, were described as*^ the men of Guildford, commorant and resident there." Therecords relative to this borough, afford but little informationas to the state of its burgesses, till a more advanced period ofour history.1689. In 1689, a report was made respecting the election for thisplace, from which it appears, that the question in disputewas, whether the right of election was only in the freemenand freeholders paying scot and lot resident ; or generallyin them, whether they paid scot and lot or not.In the course of the inquiry it appeared in evidence, thatan order used to be read in the church for all free men tocome to the election. This, according to our early institutions,was perfectly correct; for we have shewn that theFree Men only were entitled to this, as well as the otherprivileges of the place; villains — females — ecclesiastics —and othenenumerated/person&'were not entitled to enjoythis or the^trfher rights "^r~fhe town. It should also beobserved, that the notice was for all free men to come — whothe free men were we shall show hereafter — shaving previouslyestablished the fact by the return in the time ofHenry VL, that they ought to be commorant and resiant,• tlot.94, B.GUILDFORD. 103.i. e, in other words, they ought to be the persons who owed .Po°><»<^y-suit and service at the Court Leet, and ought to be enrolled Surrey.and sworn there.The Committee resolved, ^^ that the right was only in the'^ freemen and freeholders of the town paying scot and lot,^' resiant in the same :'' — a decision in the main correct, andconsistent with the general law as to the freemen and theirresiancy — ^and vrith the law of William the Conqueror as tothe paying scot and lot. But there is one immaterial errorin introducing the freeholders into the resolution; because,as we have shown before by repeated instances, the possessionof a freehold was not necessary, to make a person afreeman. It was sufficient if he were free upon any account.It is true, that the possession of a freehold was clear and .incontestable proof that he was free, and that he was thereforeincluded under the more general term of Free man, butit was upon that account unnecessary to mention the freeholders; and it might lead to error, because it might inducea notion that the possession of a freehold had a more intimateconnection than it really has, with the rights of burgess-ship.The only distinction as to freeholders is, that theevidence of their freedom was more direct than that ofothers, of which there seems to be some trace in thisborough ; as upon a subsequent occasion it was stated, thatalthough freemen must be enrolled, (by which the otherfreemen would be aware of the frict of their admission,) yetit was not necessary for freeholders; who are stated tobe entitled to vote without previous enrolment; which,perhaps, was the reason of their being mentioned in theresolution; for actual resiancy, and paying scot and lot beingrequire, the resolution would not extend the right to anynon-resident freeholders. Since the reign of Charles IL allvillainage having ceased, the distinction as to freemen, accordingto the clearest principles, ceased with it: and asresiancy, and paying scot and lot, were requisite qualifications,the parties must necessarily be householders, andtherefore the distinction of freeholder was immaterial, tobring a person within the real definition of a voter, according104 GUILDFORD.J>oaie'^7 ' to the present principles of our constitution, namely, of an.Surrey, inhabitant householder paying scot and lot.In considering the above decision, we should also recollect,that in fact the committee had no question submittedto them, whether the free men and freeholders were or werenot entitled to vote :•— but that being assumed, the questionwas, — ^whether it was also requisite they should pay scotand lot, and it was properly decided they ought to do so.1710. In 1710, the contending parties agreed that the right ofelection was as stated above; and they further agreed, thatone who had served seven years as an apprentice to a free manwas, ipso facto, a free man. This was certainly clear by thegeneral principles of the law of villainage, for a villain couldenter into no contract with his lord. If, therefore, a personwas bound an apprentice to another, it was decisive he was notthe villain of that person ; and if he served seven years withhim, it was equally clear that he was the villain of nobody — *because, even if he had a lord, he must have lived awayfrom him more than a year and a day, which, we have alreadyseen would, by the laws of William the Conqueror,* makehim free, therefore a person so serving would, in the languageof this agreed right, be ipso facto free; not by virtueof any peculiar corporate right, but under the general commonlaw :— it being requisite for the jury at the Court Leetunder the common law, to present such a person as a fi^eeman, bound to be sworn and to give his pledges; an instanceof which we shall have occasion to mention hereafter in theborough of Stockbridge, where, although that place neverwas incorporated, the jury presented persons as being freeby service of apprenticeship, and the leets made similarpresentments in the boroughs of Yarmouth and Lynn.In the course of the inquiry, where the above rights as toGuildford were adopted by agreement, another fact occursin evidence, which may serve to illustrate a material part ofour investigation. It was stated, that two persons were notrated in the parish of Trinity in Guildford, where they resided,because that parish would not receive them as inhabit.ante, p. 67, & post* Glanville.GUILDFORD.1)1181118, but they were rated where they came from. Hence Domesday.the connection of burgess-ship with the general questions as Surrey.to inhabitancy, upon which also the whole system of thePoor Laws depended. Another point as to the power ofadoption or rejection by the people of the place to which a*' Stranger" comes, occurs, and requires explanation.This power has been mistakingly thought to be the peculiarcharacteristic of a corporation, which, in the modem caseof the King and Bird,"*^ are said to have the power of selectingtheir own members : and this discretion has erroneouslybeen thought to be unrestrained and arbitrary. These propositions,when applied to municipal corporations, appear |too absurd to be really a part of the English law ; and tooartificial for the periods in which they are supposed to haveoriginated. A much more reasonable — practical— and simpleview of the subject obviously presents itself. If an individualleaving his former residence, should come to another place {where he is a stranger, the inhabitants there, if he became a |permanent resiant, would be liable for his acts, and also /ibr his support if he should be reduced to poverty they /would have therefore a clear, natural right to inquire when lther he is a person of such character and conduct, or ofsuch means, that they could safely incur that responsibility*and they were bound by the law to inquire, also, whether hewas at that time under any charge, or whether he was a Jfugitive ; for if he were, they were bound not to receive him !and if they did, would have been liable to amercement. Adiscretion of this kind, therefore, was not founded upon any Jcorporate rule or doctrine — 'but by the common law necesse !warily cast upon the inhabitants ; and it was to be exercised Iby the king's officers, with the assistance of the jury at the \court leet — ^not deciding by any whim or caprice, or accordingto any arbitrary power they had ; but deciding accordingto the fact of good or bad fame— sufficient or insufficientmeans — guilt or innocence ; and this is the real ground ofthat discretion and power, of adoption or rejection, which <has been so much abused by the corporations for a length of /13 East 385. /106 GUILDFORD*Domesday. time— ont has led to those evils that have cried aloud forSurrey, correction : — and which was also the real foundation of theacceptance or rejection of parishioners; upon notice beinggiven of their coming to live in a place, according to the oldlaw ; and the system of certificates which was superinducedupon it.Thus it was that the parishes were referred to in the casewe are investigating, and the fact to which we have advertedwas introduced into the evidence : namely, that these partieswere not rated, because the men of the town would notreceive them as inhabitants in the parish to which they hadcome — but they were rated in the parish they had left. Inthe subsequent part of the evidence it is plain that the po^v^erof rejecting whom they thought fit, was insisted upon bythe magistrates at Guildford ; for it is stated, that such ashad no right by birth or service, could not be made free butby the magistrates — ^which was perfectly correct, if theirdiscretion was exercised on the grounds, and in the manner,to which we have referred ; but if regulated by whim —caprice — or arbitrary selection — was altogether illegal andunjustifiable.The right of freedom by birth was also adverted to ; andhad the distinction between villains and free men continueddown to these times, there is no doubt but that such a rightwould have existed under the law ; because we have seenfrom the Saxon laws, and shall have occasion hereafter frequentlyto advert to this doctrine again, that freedom andvillainage were denoted by birth — and that a man was oneor the other according as his parents were " free" or '* bond."But the absurdity of continuing such a shadow of right, afterthe substance itself was wasted away, is too great to requireany further comment. This obvious inconvenience wouldresult from it — ^that where the nature and substance of thething is forgotten, it is immediately open to abuse and perversion.Thus we find in Gruildford, and many other places,that although the right of freedom by birth must, from itsvery nature, extend equally to all the children — giving tothe males direct freedom for themselves, and to the femalesGUILDFORD. 107derivative freedom for their husbands — yet, by a strange 5^^^^-perversion, it has been limited only to the eldest son ; by Surrey.superinducing upon the general doctrine as to freedom andvilleinage the rules of primogeniture, which apply altogetherto other matters ; but which the corporations and the courtsof law have most strangely ingrafted upon the doctrine ofvillainage, from unsatisfactory evidence of varying and anomaloususages. ^^Another subject is referred to in this case which will also ^!fj.jg^require an observation. It is said that a fine was to be paidby those not entitled by birth or service. This also had alegal and reasonable origin : although in subsequent times,it has been made the means of most unjust extortion, andtmdue influence. The reasonable commencement of thesefines was — ^that every bo rough separated from the county,was obliged to p provide for its own expenses of every kind \for which purpose they had a common stock, and oftentimespossessions to replenish it: — of which we have seeninstances before in Canterbury and Rochester. I f a strangercame to a town it was unreal unable that h e should d, by mean sof this common stock, be re lived from the burdens whichwould attach to his person or property, unless he should contributeto it according to the amount of the fred — thenecessities of the place — and his own means ; and thereforethe amount of his fine or contribution was a matter of arrangementbetween him, and the governors of the borough, aidedby the jury, who in many instances assessed it. Thus may bereconciled to law and reason, if the original nature of theseinstitutions is considered, that the system, as at presentpractised, is irrational — oppressive — ^and productive of muchevil, both direct and indirect. It is clearly illegal — becauseit has been expressly decided that to sell the freedom, is contraryto law, and ought to be suppressed.*No disqualification for voting is more general — has beenmore universally adopted — or is more clearly founded onprinciple — than that persons receiving alms are not entitledto vote. And yet to show the illegality and anomalous• Rw V. Bretcm> 4 Bui. 2!»7. &:■ /108 GUILDFORD.Domesday. nature of the usi^es resorted to in different places, it appearsSurrey, that, in one of the cases respecting the election for Guildford,it was given in evidence, that all freemen were allowedto vote, whether they received alms or not.1713. In 1713 the same right of election was again acquiesced inby all the parties interested: but an additional matter was alsoagreed upon, namely, that the freemen having no right tofreedom by birth, or, by service, must be admitted by theconsent of the majority of the mayor, magistrates, and approvedmen — ^which, subject to the observations we havebefore made, and taken with reference to the Common Law,that is, treating the mayor and stewards at the Court Leet,and the approved men, as the suitors there acting by theirjury, is most correct — but taken with reference to the arbitraryconsent of a modem corporation, or any persons connectedwith them, is altogether incorrect.Before closing these remarks, it should be observed, thatin one of the cases in Parliament it was stated in evidence,that the ** approved men'' meant those who had been bailiffs.An application of the term so absurd as not to require refutation,when it was obvious from the history of this place,that " the approved mens were those who having been receivedinto the borough, had been sworn, enrolled, andadmitted as the permanent responsible inhabitants of theplace.Thus we have of Guildford one uniform history from theearliest period down to the present time, that with referenceto its municipal government, and also that important rightof returning members to Parliament, the persons who borethe burdens, and shared the privileges of the place, rejectingnow the unnecessary distinctions of free men and freeholders,— ^were, according to that which is called by thelearned Committee in the reign of James the first, '^ TieCommon Right* ^ — '* The Inhabitant Householders, com-** moran and resiant, paying Scot and Lot."Stourbridge. IQQDomcflday,HAMPSHIRE.WINCHESTER, STOCKBRIDOEyChristchurch SOUTHAMPTON.In the survey of Hampshire we have very Utile informationwith respect to the Boroughs.

Both charters were substantially the same ; but1660. they had a very different fate — ^for in 1660, upon a questionwhether the word ** Burgesses" in the charter to Abingdonextended to the *' Inhabitants'' — the Committee decided that1689. they did. In 1689, it was assumed by all parties that the170B. right was in the scot and lot men. In 1708, there was a resolution,that it was in the inhabitants paying scot and lot,and it was afterwards so continued.WALLINGFORD. JUOn the contrary, Dr. Brady, being interested in the bo Oota^dty,rough of Banbury, in the year 1690 published his book on Berkshire.Boroughs, for the purpose of disproving the right of electionin the inhabitants at large, and establishing it in the selectbodies of corporations. In his treatise he has mis-statedand mis-quoted both these charters — and asserting thatthey were similar, omits all mention of the prior decisionswith respect to Abingdon, whose case was before parliamentin 1689, the year before he published his book. The 1689.effect of which was, that, in 1691, the year after the pub' 1691.location, upon the question being — Whether the right ofelection in Banbury was in the mayor, alderman, and capitalburgesses, or in the burgesses at large, — the committeeemphatically determined that the right was in the mayor,aldermen, and capital burgesses only. The history of thesetwo places, so peculiar in this respect, will require furtherconsideration hereafter.We proceed now to the survey, in the commencement of Foi. 56.which we find Wallingford entered separately from the county,and before the lands of the king.WA&LINGFORD.In the borough of Wallingford, King Edward had 276 hags,rendering 11/. of gable; and they who dwelt there did the Fo].56,R.service of the king, with horses or by water,, as far as Blind*beria, Readings, Sudtone, Besentone, and to this the reevegave them either their diet or wages, not from the cense ofthe king, but from his own. Now there are in the sameborough all the customs as were before.But of the hague there are 13 less — eight are destroyed forthe castle,* and the moneyer hath one quit so long as hemakes money. Several owners of the hag are there enumeratedOne which the king gave him, as he says —• At that time the seat of Wigod. Lord of Wallingford. I Bro.

Of 13 of them the king hath not the cu*torn ; and as yet William de Warren hath one haga of whichthe kii^ hath not the custom. Moreover, there are 22 mansesbesides, of Trenching King Edward had 15 acres, in whichhis domestic servants (huscarles) dwelt. And 45 other mansesare mentioned, as being in the several manors of Nen^neham — Haselie — Eustache — Belgrade — Sutton — and Brain.Six hagar are mentioned of Henry de Ferrariis, which, in thetime of King Edward, and also in the time of Kin Williamgave 62d. customarily to the king's farm ; now give nothing.Some of the owners of the hague are described as having thegahU of their houses ; and if blood be spilt there, if the manbe received before he be challenged by the reeve of the king,*(except the Sabbath, on account of the market, because thenthe king hath the forfeiture of adultery and theft,) theyhave the amends in their houses— but other forfeitures are ofthe king.Fifteen thanes in Oxfordshire are stated to have had 22houses in Wallingford.When geld was given in the time of King Edward, thehide gave, in common by all Berkshire, i\d, before the birthof the Lord, and as much at Pentecost.*)- If the king wouldsend his army to any place, for five hides a soldier shouldgo : — ^for his victual and pay, from every hide should be givenhim As. for two months. But these monies should not besent to the king ; but be given to the soldiers. If any onbeing summoned on an expedition went not, all his landwas forfeited to the king: :|; but if any one remaining shouldpromise to send another for him, and, nevertheless, he whowas sent should remain, his land should be quit for bOs.The king's demesne thane or soldier dying, all his armsshould be sent to the king for relief, and a horse with a sad-<die, and another without a saddle ; but if he had dogs andhawks, they should be presented to the king, if he willed toreceive them. If any are killed, a man having the king'sSax. Ll. t Sax. LI. % Sax.

And he who being warned did not come to ^^'the stable of hunting, should make 30^. amends to the king.Fifty-two other hague in Wallingford are stated to belong tothe several manors of Bastedene — Sudtone — Stivetune — ^^Harv-celle — Bristowelle — Hildeslei — Sotwelle. And aie church ofSattel held Bristoldestone — ^Witeham- — Fortune — Milton.In this entry we perceive that Wallingford was a boroughin the time of King Edward, as the reeve is mentioned : thenumber trf the hague are 276 — eight of which had been-destroyedfor the castle, and four others in some mannernot explained : one was held free of change by the moneyer.Those which were taken for the castle would becomeunder the jurisdiction of the warden of the castle,and therefore would be distinct from the borough, as wehave had occasion to observe before, and shall afterwards42ite instances to' confirm; and as it appears that the housesof the borough were removed for the castle after the timeof King Edward, it seems clear that the borough existedbefore the castle, and consequently that the former could notbe named from the latter, as Dr. Brady and others havesuggested.^'^ As the burgesses are stated to testify one of the facts referredto, it seems the return was made by them, and not bythe Hundreds, as was usual in other parts of the sur-rvey. From this circumstance, as well as from the existenceof a reeve, we may reasonably infer, that Wallingford had atthat time a separate jurisdiction, and was free from theinterference of the king's officers. We should also observe,that the services were to be done by those who resided in theborough (equi ibi mauebant) ; and that, therefore, none couldbe entitled to the privileges of the place, but those who livedthere. On the other hand, the huscarles of the king whoresided in Wallingford, would not contribute to the services -^mentioned before ; and, therefore, would not be entitle to♦ Sax. LI.VOL. I, I114 WALLINGFORD.Domesday. the privileges of the place : establishing, that on specialBerkshire, grounds of fact, (not caprice or arbitrary selection,) personsresiding in the place, could be exempted from its burdensand excluded from its privileges. The farm payable to theking, which seems to have been the fixed payment, exemptingburgesses from the interference of the sheriffs, and theother officers of the crown, who collected the royal revenues,is twice mentioned. Twenty-two manses are stated to belongto Frenchmen. It does not appear whether they were in thecountry before the arrival of William the Conqueror. Ifthey were, and were in scot and lot, we have already seen,from the laws of that King,* that they were to continue toenjoy them. On the contrary, if they were not, it wouldseem that they would not be entitled to the privileges, andof course would not be burgesses — but would be treatedas foreigners.An expression occurs in this entry, which may perhapsexplain what we have seen so frequently stated, that burgesses'houses — masses —-and hagar — are said to belong todifferent manors remote from the borough. This probablyarose from the rent of their houses belonging to the lords ofthose respective manors ; and, therefore, we find 27 hageereturned here as ^' valued " in another manor.The owners of, some of the houses, returned gablum, orhouse-rent : the tenants of the other houses, which belongedto the king, paid to him their house-rent, as is to be seenat the commencement of these extracts. The latter, however,is remitted by the charter of Henry II. The forfeituresto be paid to the king, and those to the borough, areclearly specified — shewing, that as to the greater offences,the king's officers retained their power ; but in the lesser,the borough had their own exclusive jurisdiction.Some of the remaining entries refer to the Saxon laws, insuch a manner as will satisfy the reader that they continuedin use during this reign.The enumeration of the possessions and privileges of WaleWilkin's LI. Angel. Sax. p. 228.WALLINGFORD. 115langford, concludes with stating what Wallingford paid when ^^<*""^y-the whole county was taxed ; and nothing can more distinctly Berkshire,show that the borough was exempted from the jurisdictionof the sheriff than this passage in which both its tax andits services safe stated as distinct from those of the county : —and the forfeiture to be paid for breaking out of the city inthe nighty is expressly stated to be payable to the king, andnot to the sheriff. All these circumstances render this placea striking early instance of what a borough anciently was inEngland.Dr. Brady expressly says, ** that there is no mention ofburgesses in the survey" — but so manifest an error, theabove extracts will establish.We now pass on from these entries, to the general historyof Wallingford, which, as it will afford us a very early instanceof a guild, will be also decisive to show, from its subsequentdetails, that that fact did not in any degree interfere with itscharacter as a borough.This place appears to have been of great importance fromthe earliest periods of our history ; and to have had a castlein the time of the Saxons,* from whom it was taken by ^^^•the Danes — ^who placed a garrison within it. And Sweynalso took Wallingford, and treated it as a place of principaldefence.-f-When William the Conqueror, after the defeat of Harold,:j: ^^^^•marched to take possession of London, he crossed theThames at this place, which by the historians is called OppidumGuarengefort. And it appears he afterwards gave thiscastle to a nobleman called Brientius,|| whom he madeMarquis of Wallingford ; who restored the castle, and perhapsincreased its site — as it appears from the entry wehave before quoted from Domesday, that some houses weredestroyed to make way for it.We find a charter also granted to Wallingford as earlyas the reign of Henry II. which is contained by inspeximus Hen. II.and confirmation in a charter of 51 Henry III., 1266.§ 51 Heofiii.Lamb. 1006. f Lamb. 1013. X Gist Gul. p. 142. || Lamb. 1015.Tur. Lond.Mcm. 10, No. 4. Bib. Cot. And see 2 Hearse, Lib.

And hegranted to them for ever, all their laws and customs as theyhad them in the time of King Edward, and his ancestor KingWilliam, and his son William the second, and in the time ofKing Henry his ancestor : — that is, that they should havefreely a merchant guild — and that no reeve of the king,nor any of the justices, should intromit concerning it,except their aldermen and minister. And if the king'sminister, or any justice, should charge them in any pleaor account, or should wish to call them in question,the king prohibited them, and directed that they shouldnot answer in any manner except in their own proper** Port-mote'' And, if the reeve should implead themwithout charge, they should not answer ; and if any of themshould be amerced by the judgment of the burgesses inany forfeiture or judgments of right, he shall pay it beforethe reeve ; and the king prohibited that there should be anymarket in Craumersa, or any merchant, unless there be amerchant guild. And if any one should depart from theBorough of Wallingford, and should gain his livelihoodfrom the market of Wallingford, the king ordered that heshould do according to the law of the merchant guild to theburgesses, wheresoever he should be, within the borough orwithout. And the king granted for ever to all the men ofWallingford, foil acquittance of all his gable which theyused to render for the Borough of Wallingford. Andall their laws, liberties, customs, and acquittances for ever,and all others which they can show their ancestors freelyhad, as the citizens of Winchester ever better had; andthis for the great service and labour which they sustainedfor him in the acquisition of his hereditary right inEngland. And, that wheresoever they went in their merchandisesthroughout the whole land of England — Normandy— Aquitaine — and Anjou, by water or by land, theyshould be free of toll and passage, and all customs and• Ll. Sax.WALLINGFORD. 117exactions, so that they should not be molested on this i>on»«*iiiy.account by any one, under the forfeiture of 10/. And Berkshire.the king prohibited and directed under the same forfeiture,that the reeve should not make cottage in Wal-langford,nor demand geresumam from any person: — andthat be should not establish any custom in Wallingfordwhich should injure the burgesses of the town against hisgift and grant.This charter grants to the burgesses of Wallingford amerchant guild, with all customs which belong to such abody — and it speaks of the right judgment of the burgesses,and also of the fine to be paid to the reeve. It seems thereforeclear, that the merchant guild was even at this time, aswe shall find it in many other places in subsequent periodsof our history, under the jurisdiction of the head officer, andburgesses of the place : — but it was a grant for the purposesof trade; separate and distinct from that exclusive jurisdictionwhich existed in every borough under the CommonLaw — ^and by which they were admitted — sworn — andenrolled as burgesses — the one being merely connected withcommerce, the other, a part of the government, and police ofthe country.Disputes are directed by the charter to be settled in theport-motes which is the court established under the CommonLaw : and the provision with respect to the merchant guildrequires, that if any one living by it should go out of theborough, he should do right according to the law of themerchant guild, to the burgesses, whether he be within theborough or without. Hence it is evident, that a memberof ike merchant guild might reside without the borough: whichwe have proved a burgess could not ; nor could such a nonresidentbe liable to the services, which were to be executedby those only, who were resident within the place: andtherefore this charter goes directly to establish, — that themembers of the guild, and the burgesses, were differentbodies — ^that the two institutions were of essentially differentcharacters — and that much of the difficulty and uncertaintyof this subject has originated from confounding118 Langford.P^wp^^y - these two subjects together ; which was more especiallyBerkshire, effected by Dr. Brady, who in the commencement of hisP. 9. work states emphatically, that " not one word of the Burgesses"of Wallingford is mentioned in Domesday : — this wehave shown to be unfounded.P- 144. In a subsequent part of his work, he quotes the returnsof Wallingford, (upon which we shall observe hereafter ;) andin the appendix he cites this charter for the purpose ofshowing, that the granting of a merchant guild was the substantialcreation of the borough, and formed its essentialcharacter. Whereas the borough existed before; and thetwo things are distinct, as appears by the charter — andwill be established by the subsequent history of this place.Besides, this obvious consideration would occur even to asuperficial inquirer, that if a guild were the foundation ofa borough, every borough must have had a guild — whichis undoubtedly not theft; and, therefore, to enumeratemany places in which there were guilds, really amountsto nothing, unless it can be shown that every borough hadone. On the other hand, if there is any place havinga guild merchant which is not, and never has been aborough, it will decisively negative that the guild was thefoundation of that privilege. However we shall proceedto inquire what were the consequences in a place, whereundoubtedly a guild existed.In the Testa de Neville there is an inquisition of the landsand tenements of the Borough of Wallii^ord, and whatservices the kings of England were used to have fromthence. After which there follows an enumeration of thebridges, (which probably were the hags in Domesday,)with their gables, and other burgages are mentioned, whichowed no service to the king.1227. In 1the 1 1th Henry III. a writ issued to 1the sheriff to restoreto the men of Wallingford their town,* which had been seizedinto the hands of the king because, they were not upon theview of the sheriff. The probable explanation of which proceedingi6, that, as it appears in the Testa de Neville, that the• Mad. Ex. 244.WALLINGFORD. 119services of the kin had been withdrawn, which were the ^^^^•^^y -considerations for the privileges of the borough, the sheriff Berkshire.had treated the men of the place as if they had not beenburgesses : and therefore had seized the town, because theydid not attend his view — but it being found, upon inquiry,that it was a borough, and that the services and rents weredne from it — the king orders the town to be restoredto the burgesses. From which it will be seen, that thewhole depends upon the borough being exempted from thejurisdiction of the sheriff, in consequence of the servicesrendered by the burgesses — and has nothing whatever to dowith the subsequent grant of the guild by Henry II.Having thus considered the early documents with respectto Wallingford, it remains now to inquire, who have exercisedthe privileges of the place under the name of burgesses.In the 21st of Edward I. the burgesses of Wallingford j^^i^first returned members to Parliament ; and in the 35th year lao?.of the same king, the mayor and other burgesses of theborough are fined for an arrear of their firm, and upon theirpaying the fine, the borough is restored to them.*The burgesses of Wallingford continued to return membersto Parliaments and in the 11th of Henry IV. 1410, the mayor nHeiPiv.and all the comburgesses of the town, upon scrutiny,elected the burgesses. This return is signed by 12 persons,who, in all probability, were the 12 men of the jury actingfor that year.From this return, however, Dr. Brady draws the inferences:** that all the burgesses mentioned in it were the 12who signed it:" — as if finomthe earliest periods of parliamentaryreturns by indenture, down to the present time,any individual had ever imagined that they were signedby all who concurred in the election; without which fact(that never existed) Dr. Brady's assumption is totally unsupported.And the return itself seems to raise a strong prima.facie inference against his observation, because aU theburgesses are stated to have elected scrutiny ventatisfTrin.

And inthe Testa de Neville many more than that number of burgesses• are mentioned — in truth all the documents relative to theborough would lead to a contrary conclusion. Nor isDr. Brady's assertion with respect to the community, or thegoverning part of the town, any thing more than his meregratis dictuntj disproved by the records. And even were the12 the governing part of the borough (as gratuitously assumed)it would prove nothing for his argument, because the electionwas not by the governing part of the borough, but by all theburgesses.1418. Again, in the 6th year of Henry V., the mayor anti others,with the consent and assent of all the burgesses^ elected theirmembers— from which emphatic words it would seem difficultto draw the inference, that the burgesses at large did notvote, but that the election was by the aldermen, or chiefburgesses, of whom no mention has been made before, neitherdoes the return in any manner refer to them ; but yetDr. Brady, with equal hardihood of gratuitous assumption,asserts, that those who-signed the return were aldermen orchief burgesses, and not burgesses of the lower rank.1465. In the 7th of Edward IV., the return for Wallingford ismade by the bailiffs, who, with the unanimous assent andconsent of the comhurgensesy elected, and the common seal isaffixed to the return : — ^which we shall hereafter find, frommany instances, was no uncommon assumption by the officersof any place, though not incorporated.It is useless to accumulate observations upon the generalityof the words of this return, which is similar to the former,but Dr. Brady triumphantly asks, *^ Who could have the'^ disposal, ordering and directing of the common seal of any"borough?" to which the obvious answer is, " the inhorgiants;" or if the more rigid rules of the modem .121tion doctrine are referred to, it is clear that the use of the ^^"^^^y*common seal, even of a corporation, must be regulated by Berkshire,the votes of the majority of the corporation at large.In the 1st year of the reign of Queen Mary, a return for i^^-Wallingford is made by the mayor and commonalty which,as Dr. Brady relies with so much confidence upon his community,it is somewhat singular he did not mention. However,it makes no essential difference in the case ; for weshall show hereafter, by abundant proof, that commonaltywas the most general term applied to all aggregate bodiesof every description ; and here undoubtedly described theaggregate body of all the burgesses mentioned in the formerreturns.We have at this time a clear legal recognition of theseparate jurisdiction of Wallingford, and of its being distinctfrom the county ; for we find in the same year,* the reportof a case in which a juror was challenged because hehad nothing, and did not dwell within the hundred ofMordent, from whence the panel was. To which it wasreplied, that he dwelt in the will of Wallingford, whichwas within the hundred. But it was rejoined, that the willof Wallingford, from time immemorial, was a franchise, andwholly exempt from the hundred; and that the inhabitantsof the will, and the inhabitants within the hundred, neverunited themselves, or met in any court, or were sworn uponany jury together. Upon this the plaintiff demurred, andthe challenge was disallowed, and the juror sworn, and theopinion of Bromley, chief justice, was, " because it wasconfessed that he was once within the hundred, and yethad been exempted since time of memory, it should beshown how, and by what means, and wherefore." Uponwhich technical ground alone this challenge was disallowed ;and even in that view the judgment is not very intelligible,because it is expressly alleged, that it was immemoriallyexempt from the hundred, and the documents wehave produced prove it to have been so. We find noother trace of any municipal acts done by the inhabitants• 1 Dyer, 100 a.122 WALLINGFORD.Oneida y. ^£ Wallingford, OF of their rights or privileges being broughtBerkshire. under the judgment of the courts; but they have regularlycontinued to return members to Parliament down to thepresent time, and decisions upon their right of election haveoccurred in two or this instances.15 Car.'il. Thii^inng granted a charter to the Borough of Walling-ford,reciting that it was an ancient town, having, from timeimmemorial, for the government thereof, a mayor and alderman,two bailiffs, one coroner, two constables, and otherpublic officers, of the burgesses and inhcJntanis of theborough, by whom the borough, burgesses and inhabitantshave been governed. And that lands, liberties, &c. had beengranted to the burgesses and inhabitants ; sometimes by thenames of " The Burgesses of Wallingford ** — " The Mayor,Burgesses and Inhabitants of the Town of Wallingford" —The Mayor, Burgesses and Commonalty of the Boroughand Town of Wallingford."That the mayor, bailiffs, burgesses, commonalty, andinhabitants of the Borough and Tovni of Wallingford haveenjoyed privileges and exemptions, &c., by prescription,according to the charters formerly granted to the City ofWanton.And that the king, at the petition of the mayor, burgesses,and commonalty, had constituted the Borough of Walling-forda free borough.

Andthat there shall be eighteen persons of the said borough ofthe better discretion, and more honest men and inhabitantsof the same borough, to aid and assist the mayor, &c.There was also a clause in this charter directing themanner in which the members of Parliament were to beelected, to which lye shall immediately refer.€4WALLINCFORD. 128In 1688, evidence was given that those that paid Scot and ^"^"^J:Jot to the church and town, and those only, had a right Berkshire.to vote: and therefore the committee resolved, and whicheras agreed to by the house, that "the right was in theinhabitants of the borough, paying Scot and Lot to thechurch and poor, and no others." At this time Dr. Brady'sbook had not been published — and it was subsequent to thecharter of Charles II., and consequently clearly excludedany right which could be set up under this charter.In the seventh year of the reign of Queen Anne, about ^'^*19 years after Dr. Brady's book had appeared, upon an electionpetition, it was insisted for the petitioner, according tothe above resolution, that the right was in the inhabitantspaying Scot and Lot. The sitting member, probably foundinghimself upon the new doctrine of Dr. Brady, insistedthat the mayor, aldermen, bailiffs, and eighteen assistants,had the right of election, besides the inhabitants, paying Scotand Lot.The evidence given in support of that right appears in nodegree to establish the point; for it only amounted to this,that they had never known any alderman or assistantsrefused — but it was added, that none had lived without theborough until these few years — the usage for that short time,of course, could not be a ground for deciding ; and till thealdermen lived without the borough, their right to vote couldnot be disputed, because they would be entitled as inhabitantspaying Scot and Lot.The sitting member also relied upon the charter of CharlesII., mentioned before ; a clause of which gave the right ofelection to the mayor, aldermen, bailiffs, and their assistants,called the eighteen. But it is the clear and indisputable law,as laid doyen in Olanville, that such a charter could not, underany circumstances, have altered the right of election. However,the committee decided that the right was as contended forbythe sitting member — ^thus, contrary to law, introducingthe select body of a corporation to vote, when there was aclear, explicit, previous decision to the contrary : and as thecharter could not by law, under any circumstances, affect124 WINDSOR.Domciday. ^jj^ question, still less could the recent usage of three orBerkshire, fy^^. years, when the charter itself had been granted 40 yearsbefore.The result of this case therefore is, that notwithstandingthe arguments of Dr. Brady to the contrary— notwithstandinga guild had actually existed in the borough, from thetime of Henry II. (if not before) — the privileges of the placehave ever been, and still are, exercised by the inhabitanthouseholders, paying Scot and Lot — and nothing has everinterfered with this right but the addition made by the1709. modem decision of 1709: the illegality of which, it is hoped ,has been clearly and distinctly proved.WINDSOR.Windsor we find entered at the head of the Terra Regisin Berkshire; and King William held it in demesne, asEdward had done. Neither the burgesses nor the boroughare mentioned. There appear to have been 96 hague — 26of which were quit of gable. It seems probable that Wmd-1267. sor was not a borough until the 5th of Edward I.,* whenthat king granted a charter, declaring that the town shouldbe a free borough ; and that the good men, their heirsand successors, should be free burgesses — ^and should havea merchant guild, and all the liberties and free customswhich the burgesses of other boroughs used. That theyshould be free from toll ; — and the king's justices itinerantin Berkshire should hold as well their common pleas as thepleas of the forest ; — and the capital gaol of that countyshould be in this borough, the delivery of it being alsothere.This charter differs from many which will be cited hereafter— inasmuch as they generally grant exemption from suitsof shires and hundreds, and exclude, by a non-intermittentclause, the sheriffs and other ministers of the crown : but inthis there is the peculiarity, that the power of holding pleas forBerkshire in this place is reserved ; and a county gaol isCar. Reb. Club. 106. Body. Lib. Oxford. Wordsworth's MS.WINDSOR. 126established there, the delivery of which is to be within the Po"«^y-borough. This probably explains the non-exclusion of the Berkshire,king's officers. However, from the express words of thecharter, the obvious intention of the crown appears to havebeen, that this place should in other respects resembleother boroughs.The important privilege of returning members to Parliamentseems to have been enjoyed from the earliest times, as it hadrepresentatives in the 30th of Edward I., and in the 1st of idol.Edward II. ; but in the 2nd, 6th, and 8th years of the reign 1307.of that king, the sheriff returned, that " the bailiffs of theliberty of the seven hundreds of Windsor made him no return."However, in the Ist, 4th, 6th, 7th, 12th, 16th, and16th years of the same reign, and till the 14th of EdwardIII., it returned members; as well as in the 3rd, 11th, and13th of Richard II.— the 8th of Henry IV.— 2nd of Henryv.— and in the 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 20th of Henry VI.But there were many parliaments to which it sent no members; and particularly between the 6th and 28th of Henry 1438.VI., when it commenced returning by indenture — probablyin consequence of a new charter granted by that king in the17th year of his reign.By that grant, King Henry recites the charter of the 6thof Edward I., and confirms to the burgesses all their customsin the most ample terms : further granting, that " the ftwr-** gesses and the good men of the borough, holding and residing^* within it, and their heirs and successors remaining there*^ should be free from tonnage, passage, &c. ; and grants'' them all fines, amercements, &c., of all men, tenants, andresidents, of and in the borough, with the day and year,and waste and stray ; and all forfeitures in all his courts ;^* cognizance of all pleas of lands ; and all transgressions and"all contracts within the borough, before the mayor andbailiffs." And provides, that " no person shall hold anyview of frank-pledge, or other court, unless by license orconsent of the burgesses." With power of " hearing anddetermining all matters and disputes as justices of thepeace — so that they shall not determine any felony."

It immediatelyfollows this charter to Windsor, which contains no wordsof incorporation, — that of Hull having the phraseology usedat the present day.The return of the 25th of Henry VI. states, that the mayorand commonalty of the burgesses unanimously assembledtogether, of their common council elected the members ; andthe common seal of all and singular the commonalty andburgesses having election and joining in those presents wasaffixed to the instrument, which was signed by the mayor,the bailiffs, constables and others ; and that return was pros^ duce in support of the rifi^ht of the inhabitants to vote in the1679 1689 X 1 o «1690. ' year 1679, 1689 and 169Q.27He^Vi. In the 27th of Henry the sixth, there was another returnin the same form, which had a more extraordinary fate, for1679. . it was produced on behalf of the inhabitants in 1679 and1690.1689. 1690, but in favour of the select body in 1689.1451. In the 29th of Henry VI. there was another similar return,which was produced in support of the right of the inhabitantsin 1679, 1689 and 1690.C<WINDSOR. 127In the 6tb year of Edward the fourth, a charter was dop»^^granted to the then mayor, bailiffs, burgesses and inhabit Berkshire.fonts of the town,* that ^^ the burgesses and inhabitants should ^^^iy^ibr ever thereafter be one body in deed and name, and oneperpetual community, incorporated, of one mayor and two -bailiffs, and the burgesses of the same town ; and that themayor, bailiffs and burgesses should have perpetual succession,and should be persons capable in law to hold -lands and tenements, to them and their successors ; and bythe name of Mayor, Bailiffs and Burgesses should pleadand be impleaded."In the following year, the 7th of Edward IV., a return, in a ^^^'form somewhat different from those which have preceded,was made, witnessing, that the bailiffs and comburgenses hadelected, and the indenture is under their common seal. Thiswas also produced in support of the right of the inhabitantsin 1679, 1689 and 1690.It is somewhat singular that this return should be in anew name, which the charter does not justify : for the term,** comburgenses/' had not been used before, and does notoccur in the charter. The probability is, as we have observedin the former case of Wallingford, that there was noessential difference in the substance of these returns : andthat they were all made by the same class of persons, viz.the burgesses or inhabitant householders paying scot andloL Moreover Brady states,*)- " that this return is much different."— however the only difference is the substitution ofcomburgenses for communitas; and with a strange inconsistencyhe adds, that *^ the communitas burgensium" in theformer return, " and the comburgenses in the latter, werethe same body of men :" which no « one can doubt: and ifso, the whole of those charters are explained. The communityof burgesses which existed before the 6th of Edwardthe fourth, not being incorporated, in that year t ho oliop ^ bono who wfiTO the burgesses hmrmgDeen admitted, andthe other inhabitants who ought to have been admitted, were• Mad.

Hethen triumphantly asserts, " Here we have the mystery ofthe community or corporation unfolded : it consisted of amayor, two bailiffs, and 28 or 30 brethren of the guild-hall ^who were the mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses according to*' the ancient usage and custom of the town."A glaring misrepresentation of the nature of the charter ;which, if it had occurred in a private transaction betweenindividuals, would be characterised with terms from whichwe are desirous of abstaining. For the incorporation is ofthe inhabitants generally ; and from them are to be selecteda few for the purpose of the executive government of theplace. But to assert in defiance of the charter, the contentsof which were before him, and of all the documents whichwe have before quoted, that this select body was the wholecorporation, unless indeed a part can be equal to the whole,is' contrary to first principles. However, it is after suchreasoning, that Dr. Brady riots in his triumph, and continues :^* If the ancient charters, writings, and monuments of allburghs or pretended burghs in England, were inspected,judiciously examined, and compared one with another, themeaning of the word * communitas,' communitas, or (as'^ vulgarly translated) the commonalty, would be as clear andperspicuous as it is in this place of Windsor, or any othercity or borough."These extravagant assertions of the author, are the moreunpardonable, because he omits to mention the return of the1&54. 1st & 2nd of Philip and Mary, which was made by " the^' mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses^ together with the community,** who of their common consent elected :" — expressions tooclear to admit of a doubt upon the point for which he hadlaboured so disingenuously. The returns of the 2nd, 3rd,4th, & 5th of Philip and Mary, and the 1st of Elizabeth,were precisely the same ; and were produced to support the1679,i689p right of the inhabitants in 1679, 1689, and 1690:— 1689WINDSOR. 131being the year in which Dr. Brady's book must have been in ^omesd^.the press. Berkshire.In the 26th of Elizabeth, a record occurs,* which it may be unnecessaryto cite, as further illustrating the case we havebefore quoted from Dyer/The mayor and bailiffs of Windsorhaving had a debtor in their custody, allowed him to escape ;and a capias ad satisfaciendum having been awarded to theSheriff of Berks., it was held, " that debt would lie for theescape, against the mayor and bailiffs, and not against thesheriff;" — ^which, evidently, is founded upon the principle,that the franchise, or jurisdiction of the borough, was separateand distinct from the bailiwick of the sheriff. Thereturn of this year, and many subsequent, were produced bythe sitting members in 1679, for the purpose of supporting 1679.the right of the select body ; though one of the 17th of 1642.Charles I. was produced on the same occasion, to supportthe right of the inhabitants. From these and other recordsit seems, the returns of members to serve in Parliament, hadsometimes been made by the mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses,not exceeding 30 ; and sometimes by the mayor, bailiffs,burgesses, arid inhabitants at large, but more commonly bythe former only.This usurpation appears to have continued till the 15th 1640.of Charles I., when it was brought before the considerationof the House of Commons. Aid the question was, whetherthe inhabitants in general or the particular choice of themayor, bailiffs, and some few of the town, should have thepower of election.In the report by Mr. Serjeant Maynard, reference is madeto the incorporation by Edward IV., as well as to returns inthe reigns of Edward IV. and Henry VIII. One of thecandidates was chosen by the mayor and special officers; andit was decided, that the charter being an incorporation ofinhabitants they of right ought to choose, and not the specialmen. And upon this report it was resolved by the House,that all the inhabitants of the borough, have generally theright of election.J(^tdjt (Luis /2i • Cro. Eliz, p. 26.k2132 WINDSOR.DomeadMr. However, in the 13th of Charles II. the year after theBerkshire. Restoration, another report was made by Mr. SerjeantCharleston, upon which the question seems also to have been,whether the right was in the mayor, bailiffs and burgessesnot exceeding 30, or in the inhabitants at large — and strangeas it may appear, notwithstanding the documents we havequoted, it is stated, that it was proved in evidence that theborough returned members to Parliament before the time ofEdward IV . (which should have excluded the charter of thatking from affecting the right of election); and it was added,that the burgesses, before that charter, were elected only bythe mayor, and a select number, not exceeding 30, — beingthe corporation of the borough. And that it appeared bywitnesses, and returns in several reigns, that the electionfor above 70 years had been by a select number, consistingof the mayor, bailiffs and burgesses, not exceeding 30, and1640. not by the inhabitants at large, who never chose until 1640.Undoubtedly a very strong case, and, if true, irresistible;but the reader who has perused the preceding documentswill perceive, that there is no pretence for these assertions,and that the committee of 1640 had in fact negatived them.A reasonable suspicion of the fairness of the proceeding of1661 may be entertained, because the report states only theevidence upon one side, — none appearing for the inhabitants,and therefore the committee seemed to have decided withoutany resistance on their part.This subject, however, appears to have been brought1679. again before Parliament, about 18 years afterwards, when3lChs. II* /» 11 • • rnithe case underwent a very full examination. The questionwas precisely the same as before. On the behalf of theinhabitants were produced the charter of Edward I.; the returnsof the 30th of Edward I. ; 26th, 27th and 39th ofHenry VI. ; the 7th of Edward VI. ; the 2d, 3d, 4th and 6thof Philip and Mary ; the 1st of Elizabeth ; and the 16th and1640. 17th of Charles II., with the report of Serjeant Maynard in1640; and parol evidence was also given. The decision in1661 was stated to have been made by the committee, becausethe candidates who at that time stood on the right ofWINDSOR. 133the inhabitants were wanting in the records, which were Domesday.mislaid by one Stare, who afterwards owned the fact. And Berkshire.it was protect, that at the election the inhabitants had goneto the poll and claimed to be admitted, but were refused bythe constables and tithing men.From the evidence given for the sitting member, it appeared,that the mayor, bailiffs and chief burgesses hadgone to the poll, and shut the doors while they made freemen.— That after the precept was read, the doors wereordered to be opened, but there being a tumult the constableswere directed to keep the peace and the doors, and then themayor, bailiffs and burgesses went to the election. Severalof the witnesses said, that the doors were open at the election,and that there were no orders to shut them. Andin support of the right of the select body, the returns ofthe 38th of Henry V III. ; 1st Edward VI. ; 14th, 30th and43d of Elizabeth; Ist, 7th, 18th and 21st of James L; Ist,3d, 15th and 16th of Charles I.; and 13th and 29th ofCharles II. were produced. Also the report in 1661. Andthe town book; whereby it appeared, that three severalelections in Queen Elizabeth's reign were by a number notexceeding 30.But the committee resolved, that ^' the mayors bailiffs^ and burgesses had not the right of election, but that all the** inhabitants had'*In 1680, in conformity with the general law, to which 1680.we have before alluded, founded upon the laws of KingWilliam, it was added, as a necessary qualification to theright of election, that those only who paid scot and lot wereentitled to vote.Charles II. in the 16th year of his reign, made a grant 1664.(the present governing charter), which in effect confirms thatof James I., upon which we have previously observed.In the 1st year of James II. that king presented the town ^685.with a new charter, which, upon the Revolution, was abandoned.In 1 689, the right of election for Windsor was again brought 168^-before Parliament. The Prince of Orange having, upon the134 WINDSOR.toomttday . 23d of December 1688, directed, that all such persons as hadBerkshire, served a^ kmg;ht8, citizens and burgesses in the reign ofKing SSmS^iLf should assemble at St. James's, on the 26thof December — ^they accordingly met there ; and from thencethe members went to the House of Commons at Westminster.It was then moved by Mr. Pelham, that one of the membersmight take the chair, and for that purpose he nominated theRight Hon. Hen. Powle, who being generally called on, andno person contradicting it, he went up to the clerk's table,and sat himself at a chair placed there for that purpose.Mr. Powle, at the time he took this unauthorized step,was the member for Windsor, and he seems to have beenone of the persons appointed to prepare the address whichWas agreed upon to the king. Upon the Prince of Orange'sletter for electing members for the Convention, and whichrequired that the election should be made by such personsonly as according to the ancient laws and customs, oughtto choose members for Parliament, Mr. Powle becameone of the candidates for Windsor, upon the interest of themayor, bailiffs, and the select body. And notwithstandingthe decisions we have before seen against this right, he wasreturned upon their votes, and, upon the meeting of theHouse, was elected Speaker. Against his return his opponent,Mr. Alderney, who stood upon the rights of the inhabitants,petitioned.1689. On May the 2d, 1689, Colonel Birch made the reportof the committee. The question before them was preciselythe same as on former occasions — and upon the behalf ofthe inhabitants the same return, records, and previous decisionsof the House were given in evidence, as well as parolproof, to the same effect. For Mr. Powle, and the rightof the select body, it was urged, that all the recordsproduced upon the other side were evidence for them;they being under the common seal, and dated in the guildhall,— the place for corporate acts, and that the formerresolutions of the House were upon a mistaken ground. —tt was insisted that the borough was made so by the charterof the 5th of Edward I.; and that there were, in that charter,WINDSOR. 135direct words, making them a corporation — as also a grant of ^' "^^i-sending burgesses to Parliament by relative words, giving Bwk'l**'*-them all the rights of burgesses of the borough. The returnof the 27th of Henry VI. was also given in evidence ; the electionsof the 1st, 2d, and 3d of Charles I. were insisted upon ;and also .the resolution of the 13th of Charles II. Thecommittee decided that '^ the right was in the mayor, bailiffs,and select number of burgesses only."The reader will observe, that this is in direct opposition toformer decisions : — ^that the return was under the commonseal, could not, for the reasons given before, be of anyweight: — still less the date in the guild-hall, where allthe business respecting the borough must be transacted.^^The erroneous grounds upon which ^^The former resolutionsof the House were said to be founded, are not pointedout : and it is not unusual, that those who impute mistake,are themselves mistaken. Nor would it be surprising, ifthey were guided by Brady ; which is by no means improbable,as he was then composing his book, and was muchabout the Court. But, however this error might have originated,certainly the committee were wrong in confoundingtogether the creation of a borough and a corporation :things altogether distinct : — there being many boroughsnot incorporated, and many incorporated towns not boroughs.Certainly there are words in the charter creatingIt a borough ; but none making it a corporation : a differencewe shall hereafter most distinctly point out ; as well by thewords of the charter of Hull, as with reference to its corporatehistory.It was an egregious error to have supposed, that thecharter of Edward I. granted, by its relative words, powersof sending burgesses to Parliament (at least, that theymeant so at that time), because no representation of the boroughsthen existed. The mistakes, therefore, appear tohave been altogether on the side of those who imputed them,and probably led the committee to their very erroneous decision— so contrary to all the former resolutions.In 1690, this matter was again before Parliament, upon I60o.136 READING.Domesday. f}^^ Bane grounds and evidence. And they again gave aBerkshire, similar decision— but the House rejected it ;— so effectuallyannulling both this and the preceding resolution. In 1715,1715. the subject was once more discussed in a committee, andhaving been before thoroughly exhausted and determined, allparties affreed-^thsi the right was in the inJuJntants payingScot and Lot, and it has ever so continued to the presenttime.This case, therefore, so much canvas8ed,-*^o illustratedby documents, — so productive of determination8,-^-seem9to afford a satisfactory answer to the common notion ofthe right of selection being connected with tenure, of whichtraces may be found in this place : — and also of the ** Guilds'*being the origin or characteristic of a borough, of whichthere is as strong proof in this case as in any other :^-or, ofthe right of election being a corporate right ; there being anactual incorporation of the burgesses of Windsor. Freemenhaving existed there — and the right having been twice determinedto be in the select body of the corporation. — Hoverseventually, the real nature and history of the boroughwas established, and the truth of the case prevailed ; theright having been irrevocably fixed, in the inhabitant householderspaying Scot and Lot, as the burgesses of Windsor.HEADING.Reading was not held in ancient demesne, as Brady hasmost erroneously stated; but in Domesday is describedas a borough. There is no mention of the burgesses ; nor isthere any thing further in the subsequent part of the entirewhich is material to our present inquiry. As its history,however, is in some degree peculiar, particularly with respectto the ancient guild ; and as, although it possessed a corporationand freemen, the right of election was, nevertheless,established to be in the inhabitants paying scot and lot;Charter. we shall give the details of the history and charters of theborough.Reading must be known to our readers, as celebrated forits Abbey ; but whether the borough, or the abbey, was firstREADING. 137founded, is a question which it would now be extremely Po^c^y-difficult to decide. The men of Reading, on the one hand, Berkshire.claimed privileges under King Edward the Confessor ; andon the other, it is supposed that Elfnda, the wife of Edgar,erected a monastery, but not on the site of the abbey. Itis, however, certain, that Henry I., in the 21st year of his 1121.reign, commenced the foundation of that abbey, which becamein after times so celebrated, and its possessors so powerful.At the period we have mentioned, Henry I. granted a charterto this ecclesiastical establishment ; exempting the persons,lands, and possessions from all dues, customs, postage,and other charges, — and also giving to the abbot sac andsoc, — ^toU and them, — ^infangthef, &c. — with all pleas andsuits of courts, within and without the borough of Reading.Whatever might have been the former jurisdiction of theborough, this charter was calculated, and probably intended,to restrain it. And the power of the abbot was most likelyto effect that purpose ; particularly as the same king granteda second charter to the abbey, in which, entire exemption wasgiven to the abbotand monksforalltheirpossessions^as well layas ecclesiastical ; and that they should be free of dane-geld,and all gelds, and of aids to shires and hundreds, and allpleas, with other general words of exemption, sufficient tocover all the demands that could be made upon him, bothpecuniary and personal, with reference to the forest laws andotherwise. And the charter repeats the former grant of all pleas, with sac and soc, and general jurisdiction.*This, undoubtedly, must have had the effect of materiallylessening the power of the burgesses ; as we shall hereafterfind was the case at Oxford and Cambridge. And for censuresafterwards, there were frequent struggles between themen of the abbot, and the burgesses of Reading, as to theirrespective j jurisdictions.Henry II. confirmed the privileges granted by Henry I. tothe abbey, but demolished the castle.Richard I. granted the town and tolls of Reading to theabbey ; and in the 12th year of the reign of King John, a Lo.Wainscot Ms Coates' Hist, of Reading, App. 1.J38 READING.Domewtoy . ^fjt ^as directed to the sheriff of Berkshire, and to theBerkshire. justices itinerant reciting that the charters of the abbeyhad been inspected, and it had been decided, that theabbot ought to have his court of the foreign hundred ofReading, which the king had given him as his right, concerningall assizes and recognizances, and all pleas of the crown,and this jurisdiction was ordered to be allowed. So thatnotwithstanding any previous rights which the burgessesmight have enjoyed, their jurisdiction was ousted, and thatof the abbots established.Foi. 124. B. prim the Testa de Neville we find, that the abbot andmonks had obtained possession of the borough, and retainedit ; so that at that time, it must have been entirely undertheir control. And their tenure is said to have been of the1231. gift of King Henry. In the 16th of Henry III., there is a writ,stating the exemption of the abbots and monks from scutage.*But in this reign, the burgesses appear to have attempted toprocure, at least, a partial restoration of some of their rights,particularly as to their guild ; which being of ecclesiasticalfoundation, was probably more favourably considered, andtheir privileges watched with less jealousy by the abbots, thantheir municipal rights ; and being connected with trade, wasin no small degree serviceable in supplying the abbey. We1242. therefore find, that King Henry III., in the 27th year of hisreign, granted to the burgesses of Reading, who were in themerchant guild, that they for ever, should be free from shiresand hundreds, and all pleas and tolls, and passage and coinage; and that they might buy and sell wherever they would,throughout England, without toll; and that none shoulddisturb them, under forfeiture of 10/,The burgesses, before the abbot obtained the grant of ahundred court, with civil and criminal jurisdiction, wouldhave been free from suits of shires and hundreds; andhave done that suit at their own court. But it seems fromthis charter, that the abbot having attained that generaljurisdiction, had superseded the borough court; and thefreedom from suit at the abbot's hundred, was granted byMag.

Berkshire.In the same year, the men of Reading gave 1002. to the ^^^-king for a writ, that they might possess the same libertieswhich they had used in the time of the Kings of Englandhis predecessors.It is probable, that the abbot was alarmed at the resumptionof jurisdiction which the burgesses seemed disposedto attempt, by the two charters they had obtained ;for, in the same year, a writ issued to the sheriff of Berk ^^^*shire, stating that the men of Reading had been summonedto show the warrant for their liberties, which they saidthey had from King Edward, and which were contraryto those the abbot had by the charters of King Henry andKing John. And why they came armed into the town ofReading, and expelled the bailiffs of the abbot by force,against the liberties which the abbot had by the charters ofthe king and his predecessors. And also why day and nightthey placed in the town snares for the bailiffs and servantsof the abbot, and prevented them from doing the dutyenjoined by him. And the men came, and showed noliberty, neither by charter nor any other manner, except bytheir mere statement : therefore the sheriff is commanded, thathe does not permit the men of Reading to use any libertyagainst the abbot contrary to their charters; but that heshould protect him, his men, and bailifis, in their liberties.From this document, it is clear that the struggle betweenthe abbot and the burgesses was for the exclusive jurisdiction.But the disputes between the abbot and the guild ofReading were in some degree appeased, by a concord madebetween them in the following year in the Court of King's 1264.Bench, between the' stewards of the guild of Reading and theburgesses, who were the plaintiffs, — the abbot being defendant.*The burgesses complained, that the abbot distrainedthem to plead in other places than in their commonguild ; and that he took from them their chepyng-gyld,Coates* Hist, of Reading, p. 51.140 RfiADING.^^^^"''^y* and removed the market of the town of Reading from theBerkshire, place where it was accustomed to be kept of old time ;and claimed of the burgesses other customs and servicesthan they were used to do in the time of the king's predecessors: to which the burgesses would not consent. And,therefore, it was agreed, that the abbot should grant to theburgesses and their heirs that the com market in the Urnof Reading should be for evermore in the place where it iraswont ; and that all other things were to be sold in the placesin which they were used ; and also the burgesses should havetheir chepyng gold-hall in the town of Reading, and 12messuages which belonged to the gold-hall, with a meadow,called Portman Brook,* yielding yearly to the abbot 65. SiLwhere before they were accustomed to pay only \d.And for this concord, the burgesses grant, for them andtheir heirs that the abbot shall choose one burgess, beingof the chepyng gyld, to be the warden; and who was totake an oath to the abbot and the burgesses, that he wouldkeep all that belonged to the chepyng gyld. The wardento be elected annually. And the abbot to have for the wardof the son of every burgess 4^., at the chepyng gyld, orwhen he shall be made burgess; and of every foreigner halfthe fine which he may make with the warden, by the view ofa monk of the abbot's, to bear witness in it — so that if sixlawful men of the guild testify that the fine be reasonable,the monk shall have no power to refuse it.And the burgesses grant, for them and their heirsy that itshall be lawful for the abbot to have every year at Lammas,Sd. of every bui^ess in the chepyng-gyld, in the name ofchewing-gavel ; and that the abbot may tallage the town ofReading when the king tallageth his demesnes ; and the burgessesagree, for them and their heirsy that it shall be lawfulfor the abbot and his successors, or their bailiffs, to keepcourts in the gold-hall, with all manner of pleas, — ^to haveall amercements of the gold-hall, and of others also ; andthat the key of the gyld be in the custody of the warden, —to be delivered without any contradiction to the abbot• Now called, The Kings Mead.READING. 141or Ris bailiffs, as often as they would keep any court. And ?!^^!**^'the burgesses acknowledge, that the meadow which lieth at Berkshire.the end of Portman Brook, belongs to the abbot.*From this minute record, many particulars are observable.First — the abbot had evidently been encroaching upon therights of the burgesses. Secondly — the burgesses grant forthemselves and their heirs, clearly establishing that, althoughthey were members of the gyld, they were not incorporated ;particularly when contrasted with the grant of the abbot,which is for him and his successors. Thirdly — the Portmanmeadow is obviously the common meadow, (now called theking's meadow,) to be used by the men of the town, or purlFourthly — the abbot being lord of the town, the burgesseshad held of him by the chief rent of Id. Again — the stipulation,that one of the burgesses, who is of the chepyng-gyld, should be warden, proves clearly that there wereother burgesses besides those of the gyld ; and that, consequently,notwithstanding what Brady says to the contrary,it was the borough, and not the guild, which madethe burgesses ; and that the guild was a distinct and separateestablishment, not including all the burgesses. The abbothaving the wardship of the sons of burgesses, as their superiorlord, is evidently borrowed from the Saxon laws ; andit is also clear, that every son of a burgess (not the eldestalone) was entitled to be made a burgess.Foreigners were also made burgesses upon the paymentof a fine, in the manner and upon the principles we haveexplained before. The chewing-gavel would of course onlybe paid by those who were of the gyld — but the tallage wouldbe paid by all the town ; and we shall see hereafter, that asimilar provision was made for the alleging of Salisbury,which was held under the bishop of that place.From this time the burgesses enjoyed their privilegesmore securely ; for, however the municipal rights of Readingmight have been before interfered with by the powerfulecclesiastics in their neighbourhood, it appears that theyreturned members to Parliament from the earliest period,having done so in the 26th qf Edward I. ^^•Coates' Hist, of Reading, App. 5. Richank'MS.142 READING.P*>"^*^y' In the 28th of Edward L the charter of Henry III. wasBerkshire, produced and read at the hustings in the gold-hall of Lion's'don, on a complaint made by the mayor of Reading to themayor of London, of the sheriff having distrained upon aburgess of Reading for tolls and customs ; and the sheriffwas directed to permit all the burgesses of that town tobe toll frees So that it is clear the burgesses of Readingwere then permitted to enjoy the privileges which had beenpreviously granted to them.1336. In the 10th year of Edward III. there is a claim of cognizancebetween the bailiff of the abbot and the bailiff of thetown.It appears also that the burgesses returned members toParliament in the 33d year of that reign, and during the entireof Edward II. and Edward III.; and the returns were " byand for the commonalty of the town."1^- In 1344, the 18th of Edward III., that king confirmed thecharter of the 37th Henry III. which granted exemptionfrom shires and hundreds, excepting only the fines fromall pleas: which seems intended to leave them exemptfrom the hundred court of the abbot, but to subject them tohis civil jurisdiction as to pleas. And there is anotheralteration in Edward Iii's recital of the charter of Henry III.in stating those who are to be free of shires and hundreds,as, ** all the burgesses who are in Reading," insteadof describing them as they were in the charter itself, " allthose burgesses who were in the merchant gyld." An alteration,in all probability, made by Edward III. when theburgesses had, subsequently to the concord, obtained arestoration of some of their rights : — the former restrictionhaving been introduced when the abbot's power was at theheight, and before the burgesses had ventured to insist ontheir rightsIn the 19th Edward III., 1346, in a document whichcomplains of the misappropriation of the funds the abbothad, for the support of certain chapels and bridges, and alsoAnd the same was allowed again in London, in the 7th year of Queen EHta-beth, 1564.t.

In the course of the proceedings, the abbot'ssteward, at the port-mote, is mentioned ; so that it seems theport-mote or court leet was held in and for the town, butbefore a steward appointed by the abbot. The burgessesinsisted that Reading was a borough before the foundationof the abbey, which is more than probable: for had theabbey first existed, it is not likely the latter would havebeen created. They also contended, that they had beenaccustomed to elect their own officer before the abbey wasfounded — ^that they had been used to return members toParliament — ^that they had a gold-merchant — ^and ^that theabbey was out of the town.The returns to Parliament for this reign, appear to be madeby and for the commonalty.In the next reign the charters were again confirmed, andthe return of members to Parliament was by the mayor andall the burgesses in the borough ; which appears to import,that they were resident and inhabitant.Henry V. and Henry VI. confirmed the charter of RichardIL, but the disputes between the town and the abbot continued; and the records which are extant about this period,from whence the earliest books of the Corporation commence,relate chiefly to the gyld and its officers. A stranger 1448.appears to have been made a burgess, and to have paid theusual fines; another is excused this fine as the mayor'sburgess; and persons appear also to have been expelled• Rot. Caius & (J Rich. II. M 24.144 READING.'^""^y- from the town. The admissions of the sons of freemen, andBerkshire, by Service, also occur.The return of members to Parliament in this reign appearsto have been by the mayor and commonalty.^^' In the 20th year of the reign of Edward IV. the libertiesof the town were seized into the king's hands for abuse oftheir privileges ; and in the same reign, a tax is levied on theinhabitants of the town. The return at the same period isby the bailiffs and com-burgesses, of their unanimous assentand consent.1485. In the reign of Henry VII. the town seems to have succeededin supporting their rights against the abbot ; and themayor discharged two constables, as not having been madeby the election of him or the burgesses, but by the abbot.This king also confirmed the charters of Edward III. and**^' Richard II. ; and by another charter in the 2d year of hisreign, granted to the mayor and burgesses, that they shouldhave the survey and correction of all men in the town ; —exempting also the mayor and burgesses from being summonedas jurymen, or appointed collectors of the tenths* orfifteenths.*In the same reign, the burgesses claimed to be a bodycorporate; — re-asserted their usage to return members toParliament, who were elected by the com-burgesses ; andthat they were discharged from suits of shires and hundreds,and were toll free. Still the disputes between the townand the abbot continued ; and a reference of them to twoof the judges of the Court of Common Pleas was proposed ;who at last put an end to these long existing quarrels bydeciding, that the burgesses should elect two constables tillthe next " law-day," or court-leet, when the abbot's stewardwas called upon to give them their charge, and oath, butwhich he refused to do; but the judges affirming, that themayor and burgesses of the gold-merchant were incorporated,directed that they should present three of their bodyyearly to the abbot at Michaelmas ; and that one should beelected, to be sworn according to the concord in the time ofHenry. III.; and the two constables, and ten wardens of theVide Coates' Hut. of Reading, p. G2.READING. 145five wards should be chosen by the master of the gyld, and ^°'"^*^y-the commonalty, and be sworn before the abbot ; and if any Berkshire.person petitioned to be a burgess, his name was to be givento the abbot 14 days before he was made ; a monk was to b^present at the assessing of his fine, of which half was to bepaid to the abbot, and the other half applied to the use ofthe gyld. The fine of a son of a burgess was fixed at 40s.;that of aliens were to be determined by six burgesses ; andif they affirmed it by oath to be reasonable, the abbot wasto accept it ; and finally, the chewing-gavel to be paid bythe burgesses was fixed.Henry VIII. confirmed the former charters to the Bo 1509.rough, — the decision by the Judges ;* and also granted alicense of mortmain. In that reign, a burgess, who was admitteda member of the gyld, maintained his exemptionfrom toll; and the king's letter was issued to dischargeanother from serving the office of collector of the 10th and 16th.At the close of this reign the power of the Abbey wasdestroyed; the abbot himself was executed, and his possessionswere seized inter the king's hands; after which itappears that the burgesses elected their mayor, and ThomasLord Cromwell was their high steward. The king grantedto the mayor and burgesses of the guild merchant, exemptionfrom payments to counties and hundreds, and finesand tolls.No actual charter of incorporation had been granted toReading, but, like many other places in England, the burgessesclaimed to act in that character in the precedingreign; not, however, till a considerable period after thegrant of the first municipal charter of incorporation toKingston-upon-HulL Even the admission into the gyldupon the payment of a fine, seems not to have beenexercised arbitrarily, but every person petitioning was admittedon payment of his fine : — being consistent with theancient common law, by which those who carried on tradewere recognised as free, for otherwise they could not havetraded. And as the burgesses were not confined to theCoates' History of Reading, p. 62, and see also Cl w iH sii >l iIi b Bulb Oli>|it l.VOL. I.

This select body made a bye-law,the legality of which it would be difficult to support;it provided that, ^^ Forasmuch as a great incumbrance has'' arisen frx)m the great number of burgesses, to the great** perturbation and disquiet of the west of the company,'^ their minding, tranquillity and quietness, it is ordered, thathenceforth no more shall be made till the present numberis reduced to 30."1553, In the reign of Queen Mary it was ordained by a bye-law,that every burgess should pay 20s. over and abovehis accustomed fine, as a fund for the relief of the burgessesin old age or want. It appears also in this reign,that the burgesses did not include all the inhabitants. Anentry occurs at this period in the corporation diary, of acompromise made between the burgesses and the mayor,who had been their representative in Parliament, withrespect to his wages, for which he was entitled to 51. being2s. a day for 50 days, but he was contented to take the sumof 20^., to be paid by the burgesses of the hall; althoughthe charge ought to be borne by the inhabitants of theborough. From which it appears, that the inhabitants were,even at that time, considered as the persons subject to theburdens of the place, and there can be no doubt that theywere also entitled to its privileges.t •READING. 147In the second year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth,* a pomMday.charter was granted to the mayor and burgesses of Reading, Berkshire.reciting and confirming those of Henry VII. and Henry VIII. 15^9.and granting that Reading should be a free borough, corpirate of itself, and exempt from all hundreds, counties andshires, and that the mayor and burgesses should be a bodycorporate, with the usual corporate powers; and it furtherprovides, that there shall be nine of the better, morehonest, and discreet men, inhabitants of the borough, whoshould be the capital burgesses, or head burgesses, whomay elect to themselves twelve others, or more, accordingto their sound discretions, of the better, more honestand discreet men, inhabitants of the borough, who shouldbe called secondary burgesses, or second burgesses, — themayor, capital burgesses, and secondary burgesses, beingthe common council, with power to make bye-laws; anddirects, that there shall be a steward, two sufferers, twoseijeants-at-mace, and a clerk of the market, who is to bethemayor. The first mayor and capital burgesses are nominated,and are described as honest men, and inhabitantsof the borough; the first sufferers are also stated as inhabitants;the mayor is to be a justice of the peace, with anon-intermittent clause. The mayor and capital burgessesare annually to nominate three capital and secondary burgesses,out of whom the mayor, and capital and secondaryburgesses are to elect the mayor. And the mayor, and capitaland secondary burgesses are to elect secondary burgessesout of all and singular the men whatsoever inhabiting withinthe borough, and are to elect the capital burgesses out ofthe secondary burgesses. The mayor and burgesses are toelect the stewards and serjeants-at-mace. The mayor andcapital burgesses are to hold a Court of Record from weekto week, and also a Court Leet and view of frank-pledgetwice in the year; and it grants several other privileges,which do not relate to the present inquiry, exceptingthat reference is made to the chewing-gavel paid by allthe burgesses ; and in another part of the charter, the rentsl2148 READING.D omwdfcy . are spoken of as to be paid and charged on the menBerkshire, and inhabitants of the borough; and it is granted that themayor and burgesses may devise their lands as they havebeen accustomed to do.We should observe, with respect to this charter, that itdiffers from others of this period, not being expressly anincorporation of the inhabitants, but all the officers appointedare described as such, and those to be elected areto be taken from them : therefore it appears clearly throughoutthe grant, that notwithstanding the usage to the contraryduring the reigns of Edward VI. and Queen Mary,which probably was intended to be corrected, the inhabitantswere treated as the burgesses. The charter, in conformitywith the common law, appears to recognize Reading as afree borough, by exempting it from all hundreds and shires,and the capital burgesses are put in the place of those, who,by the early Saxon Laws, were called the head boroughs.A steward is appointed, who was necessary to hold the CourtLeet; and the justices of the county are excluded fromjurisdiction within the borough; whilst the general powergiven to the burgesses of devising by will, must certainlyhave extended to all the inhabitants, otherwise it wouldhave introduced a strange confusion as to tie divisibility ofproperty, according as the party might or might not havebeen a burgess.A striking usurpation seems to have occurred in thisreign, in which the high steward, for the first time, exercisedthe power of nominating one of the burgesses tothe then next Parliament, — said to be intended only as apersonal compliment to him, or rather to Queen Elizabeth.But succeeding high stewards exercised the right,on condition of exonerating the town from the paymentof the member's wages ; which usage was continued for aconsiderable time afterwards ; for in the 20th year of King1623. James I. the Earl of Wallingford, being high steward, nominatedSir Francis Knowles, who was returned as the member.He also nominated Sir Robert Knowles, who was acandidate, but the recorder, Sir John Saunders, was electedHEADING. 149by a larger number of votes. The following agreement was Ponieaday.entered in the diary : — " Seeing that the mayor and bur Berkshire'gesses have chosen me to be one of their burgesses at thenext parliament, I do hereby promise to bear my owncharges in this service, and that they shall be quitted fromthe payment of any wages." But in 1627, the 3d of lea?.Charles I., the Earl of Banbury, the then High Steward,nominating a stranger, the burgesses refused to elect him,and wrote letters to the earl, requesting that they mightbe allowed to continue their neighbours ; and, after waitingfourteen days without receiving an answer, they returnedtheir own members, which so offended the earl that he sentin his resignation.In the 14th of Charles I. a charter was granted to 1630.Reading, and confirmed by the Parliament under the Commonwealth.*It recited, that in every monarchy the safetyof the people depends upon the crown, and all authorityis derived from the prince, and kings for that purpose areplaced upon the high throne of majesty, that, as fathers ofthe country, they should protect the people committed tothem ; and that the burgesses had besought him to confirmtheir ancient, and grant them also more ample privileges :the king directs that it shall be a free borough, and that themen, free burgesses, shall be a body corporate, by the nameof the mayor, aldermen and burgesses; giving them theusual corporate powers, and directing that there shall be, ofthe free burgesses^ one who shall be called mayor, 13 whoshall be called aldermen, and 12 who shall be called assistants.The charter then provides for the nomination ofthree of themselves by the aldermen, out of whom the aldermenand assistants are to elect one as mayor; and the aldermenare to be elected by the mayor and aldermen, out ofthe assistants ; and three assistants, by the mayor and aldermen,out of the burgesses ; the mayor and aldermen are alsoto elect the steward, the chamberlains and coroners; andthe mayor, aldermen and assistants are to make bye-laws.The mayor, deputy mayor, the bishop of Salisbury, his changeCoates' History of Reading, p. 64.

In the 20th Charles I. a Mr. Ball requested to be madea burgess, or to be admitted a freeman; he was informedthat the number of burgesses was full, and that no freemenexcept tradesmen, were admitted.* Which answer,considering the former charters, appears extraordinary;for that of Elizabeth treats all the inhabitants as burgesses,and that of Charles the I. speaks of the assistantsas eligible out of the burgesses ; and therefore, it is evidentthere must have been burgesses beyond their number, fromwhom they could be elected. As to freemen, althoughthose who were in trade were entitled to be admitted, solikewise were all other persons who were actually free,either by birth or service, although they were not in trade.And, in fact, these reasons, given to Mr. Ball, were noteffectual, for he was admitted a burgess; became a candidate,and was returned: but his return was petitionedagainst, he having only 309 votes, and Mr. Mitchell, his opponent,having 660 : — the latter number including non-freemen.Mr. Ball, however, having the greater number offreemen, — the committee decided Mr. Mitchell to be dulyelected : and so, in effect, determined that the non-freemenhad the right of voting.1659. In 1659, before the Restoration, an unconstitutional latitudeappears to have been given to the right of electionin Reading, as lodgers and inmates were then allowed tovote, which, for the reasons we have before deduced fromour Saxon institutions, seems clearly to be opposed bothto parliamentary and municipal law.1678. In 1678, there were four candidates, and considerablenumbers voted for each; 927 for one, 766 for another; 426for the third; and 384 for the fourth.1685.

Berkshire.It appears that Reading, in the beginning of the ^'^'last century, was treated as distinct from the countyat large, and the surrounding hundreds, as, upon thesheriff having assessed that borough, towards the paymentof a sum recovered from the hundred, the questionwas tried at the assizes, and a verdict found for the borough.At this date there was a petition of several freemen, inhabitantsin Reading, paying scot and lot — other freemen, notinhabitants, — divers householders residing there, payingscot and lot, — and other householders not paying scot andlot. In 1708, there was a similar petition, stating that the 1708.scot and lot men had the right of election ; when this latterpetition coming to be decided before the house, and evidencebeing received, and counsel heard, motion was made, thatthe right of election was in the freemen and inhabitants notreceiving alms ; and in inhabitants paying scot and lot ; —several amendments were moved, and made to the question,and it was resolved — "that the right was in the freemenand inhabitants, such freemen not receiving alms, andsuch inhabitants paying scot and lot."Another petition was also presented, in 1715, by the inha- 1715.giants paying scot and lot. Before this time, the rightof election had been exercised by the pot-tellers, and duringthe poll, the town is said "to have resembled a camp ofgipsies, fires being lighted in every street and alley, foreven lodgers were entitled to this privilege."These abuses led to the above petition, and in 1716, 1716.Mr. Hampden reported, that the petitioners alleged, " thatReading was a borough by prescription, and that the electionwas only in the inhabitants paying scot and lot" — butthe sitting members insisted that the freemen had also a rightto vote.The petitioners gave in evidence the extract from the roll offines of the 37th of Henry III., which we have before quoted :and also the returns of the 33d of Edward I., the 1st and 19th152 • READING.i^tn^^y. of Edward IL, Ist and 43d of Edward III., and the 1st ofBerkshire. Richard II.The sitting member insisted on the ancient usage, and thedetermination of 1708, as well as parol evidence, to show,that, before that time, all housekeepers, freemen, and eldestsons of freemen, being of age, were allowed to vote. Andthe committee resolved that the right was in the ^' inhabitantspaying scot and lot''In the course of the evidence, one of the evils resultingfrom the right of voting in respect of freedom transpired, forthe voter proved, " that after the proclamation was out foranew parliament, he had his freedom given him to votefor the sitting members — for which he promised his vote'And it was also reported by the committee, "that it appeared,from the evidence, that most of the bribed votersupon either side were only freemen, and not inhabitantsthat paid scot and lot."Thus we have traced the history of Reading from itsearliest period — it was clearly a borough by prescription,and there is every reason for thinking that it existed beforethe Abbey. One of the most striking indications of its havingbeen an ancient borough is, — that it was divided intowards ; and it appears that, from the earliest times, it wasexempted from the jurisdiction of the sheriff, and separatedfrom the county at large, of which there is decisiveproof, from a circumstance very material with reference tothe general view of the subject ; that the inhabitants wereexempt from serving upon juries, either at the sessionsor assizes ; nor have they ever contributed to the gaolor county rates. — there seems always to have been withinthe borough a guild ; — and their ecclesiastical neighboursappear frequently to have interfered with the rights andprivileges of the borough. — Freemen long existed withit, with all the rights of birth. — Service, — and even themodem innovation of primogeniture. Trade was also supposedto give a peculiar right to the trader — and freemenwere admitted (as in many other places) to the severalcompanies of mercers — cutlers — bell-founders — tanners —READING. 163clothiers — and vintners. — Foreigners are mentioned. "^ Pis Po"*'»<^y*enfranchisement were frequent : — and the burgesses, as a body Berkshire.distinct from the inhabitants, are often spoken of in therecords. Notwithstanding all these indications, so muchrelied upon in other boroughs, the House of Commons, withpropriety rejected the guild, as a matter collateral to theborough, and the freemen, as a distinguishing and essentialcharacteristic in the early parts of our history, but now entirelyobsolete and immaterial; since all the military andother feudal tenures have been destroyed. No such distinctionnow existing — " all men are free." According, therefore,to the simple rules and primary principles of our constitution,the House of Commons finally and justly decided, that ** theright was in the inhabitant householders paying scot and lot :leaving, nevertheless, the farther act to be done, which thelaw required, namely, that such inhabitants should be admitted,sworn to their allegiance, and enrolled in the CourtLeet :" — a qualification so essentially serviceable, for the purposesof police, good government, and practical administrationof the law.WILTSHIRE.MALMBBURY,Edwin,WILTON,Devises,Cane,Danton.CRICKLADEIn Wiltshire, there were 16 parliamentary boroughs : Salisbury,Wilton, Denton, Hindoo, Westbury, Shaftesbury,Calne, Devizes, Chippenham, Malmsbury, Cricklade,Ludgershall, Old Sarum, Marlborough, Great Edwin,Wotton Basset ; of which six only are mentioned as boroughsin Domesday; — Malmsbury, Wilton, Calne, Bedwin, Devizes,and Cricklade. Two burgesses occur in the entry of Down-ton; but whether they were ih Denton, is not specified.There are, besides these, three other places mentioned as154 MALMSBURV.Po"-^y' boroughs — ^WarminBter, Bradford, and Sudtone, — ^which areWiltshire, not trow parliamentary boroughs. The material facts as toSalisbury, are the following.Salisbury.Fol.64,B. In thg borough of Malmsbury, the king hath 26 mansesinhabited f and 26 manses in which tigre are houses which donot render geld more than waste land. These manses rendergable.The abbot of Malmsbury hath four manses and a half, andwithout the borough, nine cometh, which are taxed with theburgesses.After which follows an enumeration of the owners of themanses.Before the Terra Regis, it is entered, that Walter, fortwo parts of the borough of Malmsbury, renders 8L to theking. The same borough rendered as much in the time ofKing Edward : and in this ferme, there were pleas of thehundred of Limestone and Stutelesberg, because theybelonged to the king. Of money, the same borough renderslOOs. In the same borough. Earl Harold had one field ofland, in which are four manses and six others waste, and amill rendering 10s.When the king goes on an expedition by land and sea, heshall have of this borough, either 20s. to support his mariners,or he shall land one man with him, for the manor of FiveHides.In the entry of Langhelai, it is said, " In Malmsbury onebui^ess, rendering 15d. belongs to this manor."The church of Malmsbury had Sumreford. At Malmsbury,one burgess renders I2d.Foi.e9,B. Edward of Salisbury held Werocheshalle — two burgessesin Malmsbury render 2s.Fol.7o,B. Sumreford — in Malmsbury, one bui^ess renders 12j.Foi. 72. Ralph de Mortimer held Hunlavintone, in Malmsbury,one house rendering 12^.Fol.72,B. Aldritone — ^in Malmsbury, one burgess rendering Id.Malmsbury was clearly a borough at this time. TheWILTON. 165manses are mentioned ; some being described as inhabited, ^"^"^y*and others as having houses, but which did not render geld Wiltshire.more than waste land: from which it would appear, thateither these are placed in opposition to the inhabited manses,and were uninhabited ; or, if inhabited at all (which is themore probable connects, because otherwise, they would bereturned as inhospitality the inhabitants were either unableto pay geld, or were persons not liable to that charge : —again establishing the fact, that there might be householdersnot subjected to the burdens of the place.The manses of the abbot, which are taxed with the burgesses,are stated to be without the borough ; which furtherconfirms, that the liberties often extended beyond.The subsequent entry as to Malmsbury shows, that it wasa borough in the time of Edward the Confessor ; and thatsome of the property belonged to Harold.The entries in the different manors of burgesses in M almsbury, establishes, that persons being householders in theborough, and in respect of their residence there, being burgesses; held, either in the borough or out of it, of the severalmansions where they are mentioned.The different form of expression, whether '^ at" or ** in" theplace, if minutely examined throughout the survey, mightexplain to which of those causes these entries might be referred.It ought to be observed, that in one manor, a house inMalmsbury is mentioned, and no burgess. Perhaps it wasnot inhabited by a burgess, but by a female, or some personexempt from burgess-ship ; — a probability which is muchincreased by the fact, that the chaise upon that house, andupon a burgess, are the same.WILTON.Wilton is mentioned as a borough, paying rent to the Fol.64,B.king, and its burgesses are spoken of in several manors likethose of Cricklade ; but there is no other material entryrespecting them in the borough.155 .Cane.Domesday. jjj ^h^ Terra Regis, Calne is entered as follows : —Wiiuhire. The king holds " Canna." King Edward held it, and'it was never gelded; therefore, it is not known how manyhides there are there. The land is 29 carucates. In demesnethere are ploughs and servi, villains, borders, colbert.There are 45 burgesses. The villains render the farm ofone night.To this manor, Niger holds of the king a church withsix hides of land. In demesne there are two carucates —servi — villains — ^bordarii — cometh — ^and there are 26 burgessesrendering 20s.Fol. 66. The Bishop of Salisbury held Cunningham. — In the boroughof Cause, one house belongs to this manor, rendering20d, by the year.Fol. 70. Palestine. — In Calne, one burgess renders lid.Calne was a borough in the time of King Edward,and as there are both villains and burgesses belonging tothe manor, it is clear, that the holding under it was not sufficientto make a burgess. It is also evident, that villainsmight reside within the borough — ^and they would not beburgesses. The lands at Calne are to this moment divided,much in the same way as they are in Domesday. A lay andecclesiastical manor; — and the resident householders uponeach of them, being of free condition, and not villains, wouldbe burgesses — and consequently, we find that there are burgessesbelonging to the church there; which, though ofecclesiastical possession, was held by Niger, a lay-man.There is a house in the borough still belonging to Paintings,which at that time was occupied, either by a femaleor one of the villains ; and this entry, like those of Salisbury,is decisive to show, that those occurring in othermanors were with respect to the property in the boroughheld under them, and not that the burgesses resided in thoserespective manors, as some have very erroneously conceived.Thus, the burgess in Calne, who is entered in the manorof Vanstone, was an inhabitant householder, residing inCalne, holding under the manor of Vanstone — which hasstill some houses in Calne.BEDWIN.-DEVIZES.-CRICKLADE. 167Domesday.Edwin. Wiltshire.Bedwin was also a borough in the time of King Edward ;the entry is so similar to Calves that it requires no furtherobservations and is as follows : —King Edward held it. It never gelded — ^nor was it hided. Fol.64,B.The land is four score carucates, or less. — In demesne thereare 12 carucates, and 18 servi. There are four score villains,and 60 cometh, and 14 colbert.To this manor belong 25 burgesses. This will renders thefarm of one night, with all customs.Devises.Devizes is also included in the king's land, under thename of Theodolveside — at least, if that name is applicableto it.* Some have conjectured,, that this name referred toTilsit ; but it is not probable that so small a village shouldhave had so many burgesses.The entry is as follows :The king holds Theodolveside. King Edward held it. ^ol- W-It did not geld, — ^nor was it hided.The servants — colbert — villains — and covets, are mentioned,— and 66 burgesses.This entry establishes nothing material, excepting thatDevizes (if it were the place intended,) was a borough in thereign of King Edward ; and at the compilation of the survey,there were as many as 66 burgesses.CRICKLADE.The borough of Cricklade is not mentioned in Domesdayby itself, but its burgesses occur in many manors, as inAldebome — Ramsberie — Badeberie — Piritone — LeddentoneLediar — Chiselled — Clive — Colecote. In the whole thereare 29 enumerated.The church of St. Peter of Westminster is stated to hold Fol. 67.the church of Cricklade, and hath there also many burgesses.In the Testa de Neville both these names occur — Devizes and Theodolveside ;but whether they were different appellations for the same place is not apparent.158 . BRAD FORD.— Axminster.— DORCHESTER.Domesday. Xhcsc extracts, expressly stating that the burgesses are inWiltshire. Cricklade, confirm the inference we have before drawn, thatall the manorial entries spoke of burgesses residing in theborough. . .'iW. > *BRADFORD.ftFol.67, B. In the entry of Bradford there ai^33 burgesses-mentioned,but it is not called a borough, nor does any thing moreoccur respecting them.Axminster.Amongst the demesnes of the king, Axminster also isentered ; and 30 burgesses are stated to be " there' butnothing farther occurs.DORSETSHIRE.DORCHESTER, Markham,Bridgeport, SHAFTESBURY,There were in Dorsetshire, nine parliamentary boroughs,including Weymouth and Melcombe Regis — ^viz. Dorchester,Poole, Lyme Regis, Weymouth and Melcombe Regis, Bridgeport,Shaftesbury, Corse Castle, Wareham, — of these, onlyfour — Dorchester, B ridpor t, War sham , and Shaftesbury —are spoken of directly as boroughs — as having burgesses —or are entered separately from the county. Poole, Lyme,Weymouth, Melcombe, and Corse, are not mentioned.Before the lands of the king, with Bridport, Wareham,and Shaftesbury, is the following entry of Dorchester.DORCHESTER.Fol. 75. In Dorchester, in the time of King Edward, there were172 houses; these, for all service of the king, defendedthemselves, and were gelded for 10 hides — ^to wit, to the useof the huscarle, one mark of silver, except the customs,which belong to the farm of one night.Bridgeport. 169Now there art four score and eight houses, and 100 (dto- oomw^.gerbier destroyed, from the time of Hugh, the sheriff, until T^orset-now.The abbey of Fortune h^d.in Dorchester one house. In Foi.78,B.the Bishop of Salisbury's manor of Terminate, there isentered in Dorchester one burgess.There is in this entry of Dorchester nothing material, exceptthe number of houses, and the reduction which had takenplace byjthe destruction of many of them.The entry altogether tends to confirm the opinion, — ^that theorigin of boroughs was' the Collection of population in thehouses built in t)i^pl^(^:'*%Qd>the two concluding entriesconfirm the point «^rhaYe'J)tfore alluded to, of some of thehoused being i|^ ^'^^If^'^^o^^i persons who were not boundto be burgesse^and^O^ ifUis^bitants residing in the town beingbui^es^s,: although they held (tf foreign manors.Bridgeport.The entry of Bridport is to the following effect : —In Bridgeport, in the time of King Edward, there were Fol.76.120 houses, and for all service of the king, they defendedthemselves, and were taxed for five hides ; to wit, to the useof the huscarles of the king half a mark of silver, exceptthe customs which blois to the farm of one night. Nowthere are there 100 houses, and 20 are so destitute that thosewho dwell in them cannot pay the geld.The holders of these houses not paying geld would clearlynot be entitled to the privileges of the borough. This is anotherstriking confirmation of the doctrine, that there neverwas a period in our history in which all the inhabitantindiscriminately were burgesses, but only those who, accordingto the Laws of William the Conqueror, paid scotand lot ; and those who, according to the Saxon laws, hadgiven their pledges, and bound themselves to the law at theCourt Leet.160 WAREHAM.-SHAFTESBURY.Domesday.Dorset Markham.shire.Fol.75. I" Wareham, in the time of King Edward, there were143 houses in the king's demesne. This town, for all serviceof the king, defended itself, and was taxed for 10 hides ;to wit, one mark of silver to the husearles of the king,except the customs which belong to the farm of one night.Now there are 70 houses, and 73 are altogether destroyedfrom the time of Hugh the sheriff. On the part ofSt. Wandregintius, there are there 45 houses standing, and17 are waste. On the parts of other barons, there are there20 houses standing, and 60 are destroyed.The Bishop of Salisbury had Terminate, andIn Wareham two burgesses, with 12 acres of land, belongto this manor.Fol.80,B. Robert Fitz Gerald had Povintone.In Wareham, one burgess rendering 2s.SHAFTESBURY.The entry of Shaftesbury follows next, and is to thiseffect : —Fol. 75. In the borough of Shaftesbury there were, in the time ofKing Edward, 104 houses in the king's demesne. Thistown, for all service of the king, defended itself, and wastaxed for 20 hides; to wit, 1 1 marks of silver to the husearlesof the king. Now there are there 66 houses, and 38 aredestroyed from the time of Hugh the sheriff until now.On the part of the abbess there were, in the time of KingEdward, 163 houses ; now there are there 111 houses, and 42are altogether destroyed. There the abbess hath 151 burgesses,and 20 manses vacant, and one garden.It should be observed, vrith respect to these four places,that they have all returned members to Parliament fromthe earliest times, and that the persons who have been decidedas entitled to vote for members of Parliament havebeen the inhabitants paying scot and lot.In Dorchester there is a corporation, the members ofwhich have never voted ; and, excepting that some intricacySHAFTESBURY. &c. &c. 161has been introduced into the right of election by the dis Po™«^y-tinetion between personal and real property, and a question l^^rset-also with respect to residence, the right is substantially asstated above.In Bridport there has been a corporation ever since thereign of Queen Elizabeth ; and, in 1628, the two bailiffs, and13 capital burgesses, claimed to have the right of election,and to exclude the commons, to whom they gave no warningof the election. On their behalf it was said, that theyhad the right, because they contributed towards the expensesof the members; and it was agreed by the majorpart of the committee, that the " commoners " had voice inthe election, and that it was void, as they had no warning.The House also resolved, that the " commonalty " in generalhad the right ; and that the election was void.In 1716, the term ^* commonalty ^^ in the above resolution,was decided to mean the ^* inhabitants' and in 1762, toinclude only the ^' inhabitants paying scot and lot'*As to Warehamj it should be first observed, that thecircumstance to which we have so frequently adverted, ofpart of the borough being held of different lords, and ofdifferent manors, is confirmed by the entry of the numberof houses in different parts of the town ; one part belongingto St. Wandregisolius, and other parts to the barons.In 1690, the right was agreed by all parties to be in theinhabitants paying scot and lot, and in the freeholders ; — andyet this place also has a charter of incorporation.In Shaftesbury, likewise, there is a corporation : — Yet in1696, the exclusive right of that body to vote was negativedby two resolutions :— the first of which decided, that theright was not only in the mayor and burgesses of theborough: — the second, that the right was only in the^^ inhabitants paying scot and lot'' — ^which decision has beenacted upon ever since.As in substance the burgesses of all these places aredecided to be the same class, so are the entries with respectto them substantially the same ; though one may bemore particular than another, or omit that which in anotherVOL. I. M162 SHAFTESBURY.Dompflday. jg inserted. They are all separated from the county, —Dorset the Strongest proof of their being boroughs. Yet they allvary in such immaterial circumstances as would be likelyto occur where the returns were made by different persons.Such, for instance as the burgesses not being mentionedby name in Dorchester. But this would easily be accountedfor, by its being known to every body that it wasa borough. The essential point, with a view to the paymentsto the king, are the houses: these are distinctlyenumerated, as well those remaining, as those which weredestroyed.SOMERSETSHIRE.MILBORNE PORT,BATH,Rochester,TAUNTON,Languor,Abridge.There were eight Parliamentary Boroughs in Somerset-shire,— Bristol, Bath, Wells, Taunton, Bridgewater, Ilchester,Minehead, Milbome Port. Of these four only are mentionedin Domesday; Milbome Port, Taunton, Bath, Il-chester.The entry of the first of these among the kings lands isas follows: —MILBORNE PORT.Fol.86,B. The king holds Melebume. King Edward held it: it wasnever taxed, nor is it known how many hides are there.The servi — villains — and bordarii, are mentioned.In this manor there are 56 burgesses, with the marketrendering 6O5.All Melebume, with the aforesaid appendices, rendersfour score pounds of white money, 9*. 5d. less.In the time of King Edward, it rendered half the farm ofa night, and a fourth.Fol.91.

The king hathsix waste houses.This borough, with Stone, renders 60/. and one markof gold; besides this it renders money 100s. Edwardrendered 11/. for the third penny. Ore house is removed.Hugh holds it, and it is worth 2s.The church of St. Peter of Sade hath, in the same borough,24 burgesses, rendering 20s.TAUNTON.The entry of Taunton is, that the bishop of Winchester Fol.87, B.holds Taunton: after which succeeds an enumeration ofthe lands, — villains, — ^bordarii, — servi, and the colbert;and then follows the entry, that there are 64 burgessesrendering 32s. (that is 6d. each) ; and the market is alsomentioned.Of these four boroughs it will have tween seen, that threeof them were the demesnes of the king ; the fourth, Taunton,was held by the Bishop of Winchester. They all returnedm2jg4 MILBORNE PORT.-ILCHESTER, &c.Domesday, members to Parliament from the earliest period : and three ofSomerset them have had decisions, establishing that the burgesses of** "^' those places are the inhabitants paying scot and lot ; though,in some few particulars, the constitutions of those boroughshave by modem usages been made to vary; neverthelessthe entries of all are in substance the same; they differonly in the rents or services they owed to the king.Of Milbome^ort the burgesses are expressly mentioned;the same of Chester ; and the burgesses of Bath appear bythe entry to have been of the same description as the others.Yet with respect to that place, of which we shall haveoccasion to speak more particularly hereafter, the selectbody of the corporation have been decided to have the rightof voting, notwithstanding all the returns were generally bythe citizens ; and there were freemen in the borough, who in1660, claimed to join in the election.There is no report in the journal of the determination of thecommittee in the case of Bath ; but Mr. Prynne,* appearsto hold out, that it was decided, or ought to have beendecided, against the freemen ; and upon his representationof the arguments, and probably in pursuance of Dr. Brady'spublication, it seems that in 1706, the right was determinedto be in the mayor, aldermen and common council only.With respect to which decision we shall subsequently haveoccasion to make some observations. In the meantimeit is only necessary to observe, as to this entry in Domesday,that Bath paying its geld when the shire was taxed,is another proof to show that these boroughs were treatedas separate from the shire, although in this instance theyare entered generally amongst the lands of the king. Itshould also be remarked, that, as there was a reference tothe other barons in the entry of Wareham, so also in confirmationof our former]! observations, that the burgesses inthe different boroughs might belong to other lords, and beheldof other manors, — the entry here is expressly of " theburgesses of other men."With respect to Taunton the burgesses are entered in theIn the Second Volume of bis Brew. Pari. Red., p. 318.TAUNTON. 165some manner as in the other boroughs ; but its history has ^^^*^y-seen very peculiar. It returned members from the earliest Somerset * »•^ * shire.period, and notwithstanding it was incorporated in the29th Charles IL, the right of election was declared, in 1715, ito be in the inhabitants : but, by one of those perversions ofthe law, which local usages have introduced, it was not confined,as the common law would require, to the inhabitanthouseholders paying scot and lot, duly admitted and swornas burgesses; but it wis extended to pot-wallers, — a supposedright of election which prevails only in three boroughs inEngland, viz. in Gregory, Honiton and Taunton. In ,eachof which we shall have occasion hereafter to show, that ithas been an innovation unauthorized by the simplicity ofour common law, — bearing with it the best proof of its beingso, in the frauds, uncertainty, and abuses with which theexercise of this right is accompanied : — and which establishit to be incapable of being reduced to any reasonable ruleor regulation; almost impracticable; and open to everyabuse.In 1776, this right of election seems to have been actedupon without further consideration, excepting that the difficultywas experienced of defining what a pot-waller was ; andone reasonable restriction at least was affixed, that it shouldbe accompanied with the qualification of a parochial settlement.If actual inhabitancy, instead of merely boilinga pol, which is only one instance to prove inhabitancy, hadbeen insisted upon, the right would, by whatever name thepossessors might have been called, have been brought withinsome reasonable accordance with the law: as it is, thisdecision appears to have authorized a most unreasonableextension of the right, beyond any thing which legal principleswould justify.There is another peculiarity with respect to Taunton whichshould be remarked, as showing, that the existence of a corporationin the place is in no degree necessary, either tomake it a borough or to enable it to return members toParliament: but the being incorporated is a matter collateralto both. For Taunton, like most other places, was a166 LANGPORT AND Abridge.^^"""^y' borough, and sent members to Parliament, before it was in-Someone corporate. It afterwards obtained a charter of incorporation.In 1776, and for a long period before that time, the mayorof the corporation had been the retaining officer; but by neglectin electing the proper municipal officers, the corporationbecame dissolved. Yet it has continued a borough : it hissever since returned members to Parliament : and the returning■^ IW^I**^^^officers are, accord ng to the common la w, the constables ,appointed by the jury at the court-leet of the bishop.LANGPORT AND Abridge.Besides the parliamentary boroughs, there are two othersmentioned in Somersetshire — Lang-port and Abridge, Uponthe former of which it may be necessary to make a fewremarks. Of the latter, Abridge the burgesses only areslightly mentioned. But Lang-port is expressly describedamongst the king's lands as a borough ; and is so entered atthe commencement of the return for Somersetshire, immediatelyafter the manor of Merton, — thus — ^^' there is therea borough, which is called Lang-port, in which dwell 34burgesses ;" and five of the burgesses are described asbeing " in Lang-port, and belonging to the manor of North-currie."It must be observed, that these burgesses, in conformitywith the doctrine for which we have contended, are describedas dwelling in Lang-port. In the time of Queen Elizabeth, anexemplification was granted of the extract from Domesday,for the purpose of showing that the people of Lang-portwere entitled to certain privileges, from their borough beingancient demesne; which we shall see hereafter was donewith respect to many other boroughs, particularly Calne.In the reign of James I. Lang-port was incorporated —that, however, we shall have repeated opportunities of showing,does not alter the essential character of the place ; butonly produces the effect of giving the burgesses, who existedbefore, the right of holding their lands and possessions inperpetuity to them and their successors, under a corporatename.LANGPORT. 167It is a striking circumstance that in the charter of incog ^'""^^y-portion, Lang-port is said to be held by borough English ; Somerset-forivhich there seems no pretence. However, the houseswithin it are, in many documents, described as burgages;but there are other properties — as closes, cottages, thechapel, and the school-house — which are not so described.If therefore, there really were any peculiar privileges belongingto burgage tenure, Lang-port would seem to beentitled to them. But the fact is, that every borough washeld by burgage tenure, from London to the smallest in thecountry : — it being the very nature and essence of a borough,that it should be held by that species of tenure : which is,in truth, holding in socage, or by free tenure : — shaving init nothing peculiar to any particular borough, but beingone uniform system of tenure, as general and uniform in itsnature as freehold, gavel-kind, borough English, or anyother of the numerous methods of holding. Notwithstanding,however, Lang-port was a corporation, and was heldin burgage tenure ; it had all those accompaniments whichwould belong to a borough under the common law. Fromthe books containing the proceedings of the place, it appears^that it had a port-reeve : — ^that a court-leet was held : —that the jury at that court made their usual presentments;and amongst other things, presented the different officers ofthe borough. There is no selected body of the burgesses ;but all the inhabitants are treated as such ; the chief burgesses,as well as the other officers, being selected fromthem; and the former are appointed for life, unless in themeantime they shall depart from and dwell out of the borough.As it has not returned members to parliament, there has beenno temptation to pervert or abuse its privileges: — and thereforeit seems to have continued much in the saide state asthe common law left it.168 EXETER.Domesday.DEVONSHIRE*Exeter OAKHAMPTOKyBARNSTAPLE, Witness,J."lJ!l|li^'i' LIDPORD.In Devonshire there were 12 parliamentary boroughs — 'viz.

The city of Exeter is entered separately, at the beginningof the returns, thus —In the city of Exeter, the king hath 300 houses renderingcustoms ; these rendered 18/. a year — of this, Baldwin, thesheriff, has 6Z. In this city there are 48 houses waste, afterthe king came to England. This city, in the time of KingEdward, did not geld, except when London, York, andWinchester gelded. When an expedition went by land ofsea, this city served for five hides. But Barnstaple, Lide-force, and Totness, served as much as the city itself. Theburgesses of Exeter have without the city, 12 carucates ofland, which render no custom, except to the city itself.The Bishop of Constance has in Exeter, three houses andone waste, which were in the demesne of King Edward, andrendered custom.Dragon holds of him there, six houses.

And considering the position of these170 EXETER.Do metdgy. fQ^. cities, they seem to be disposed in nearly the sameDevon situations with respect to the limits of England — in theshire. 111east, west; south, and north.The service which Exeter did, appears equal to that ofthe three boroughs of Barnstaple, Lideforde, and Totness.The burgesses are stated to have some land without thecity; which was, in all probability, used in common bythe citizens, and was usually without the walls, thoughwithin the liberties. As those who enjoyed the benefit of itlived within the city, and paid custom for their houses, itis but reasonable that they should pay none for the landthey had in common — ^by somewhat the same principleas farm-houses are not liable to pay tithes : they renderedtherefore no custom, except to the city, — ^which probablywas nothing more than an acknowledgment, upon puttingtheir cattle into the common — ^in many places called anincome''The numerous houses entered as belonging to the other severalmanors, are all described as being in Exeter, or by someother term denoting their local situation within the city.The identity of these houses with the burgesses, seems to beestablished by two or three circumstances : one, that thecustom of a house and of a burgess are the same — ^viz. Sd. ;and in other places it is spoken of generally as the ^* king'scustom'' — it probably being well known that 8d. was thefixed sum. In the Abbot of Tavistock's possession, as wellas Walter Dowai's, the houses and burgesses are mentionedtogether ; as they each have a house in pledge of a burgess.And in confirmation of what we have before said, of housesbeing within the boroughs, although they belonged to distantmanors, it is stated, that Baldwin, the sheriff, holds 12houses in the city itself, which belong to his manor ofGhent. The same occurs again in the entry of the manorof Ghent ; of which it is said, " to that manor belong 1 1burgesses in Exonia" — which probably ought to be translated,in the liberty of Exeter.BARNSTAPLE.-OAKHAMPTON.— Witness. 171Domesday.BARNSTAPLE. Devon-theentry of this place is as follows:The king hath the borough of Barnstaple. King Edward ^o^- *00.had it in demesne.There are within the b rough 40 burgesses^ and 9 are tcith -cut the borough.There are 23 houses waste, after the king came intoEngland.The bishop hath in Barnstaple, 10 burgesses, and seven ^ol- 102.houses waste ; and in the entry of Frammintone, one otherburgess.Baldwin, the sheriff, hath in Barnstaple, seven burgesses, Pol los, b.and six houses waste.The same holds Ascerewelle : in Barnstaple, two ^^^ ^^' ^'houses. Fol. 113.And Robert de Albemarle has in Barnstaple, two houseswaste, rendering 4rf.Nine of the burgesses of Barnstaple are stated to bewithout the borough. These, like the common lands ofExeter to which we have referred, must be considered asbeing within the liberties, though without the walls.Southampton.It is also entered, that Baldwin, the sheriff, holds of the fol 106, b.king, Ochementone, — and there lies the castle : — the landsin demesne are mentioned ; also the lands and Bordarii —four burgesses — ^and the market.We have before observed, that the castles were usuallyseparate from the borough. The entry of the manor ofOakhampton seems to confirm that position ; for the expressionwith respect to the castle is, ibi sedes castellum : had itbeen in the borough, the expression probably would havebeen, in analogy to other entries, ibi est in burgh.Witness.Judhel holds of the king, Totenais borough, which King ^oi- ws, b,Edward held in demesne. There were within the borough.172 Bedford.Domesday. iQQ burgesses, five less, and 15 without the borough, tillingDevon the land.This borough did not geld, but when Exeter gelded, — andthen it rendered 40d. for its geld.If an expedition goes out by land or water, between Tote-mais,Barnstaple, and Lideforde, as much service is renderedas Exeter renders.Totness also has its burgesses without the borough. Thesemust be taken as being within the liberty; which is moreprobable from their being described as tilling the land,no doubt belonging to the borough, or otherwise it wouldnot have been mentioned with it.Bedford.Before we quit Devonshire altogether, it is fit to observe,that another place, Bedford, not now returning members toParliament, is mentioned in Domesday as a borough, and ashaving a considerable number of burgesses ; also lands, bothwithin and without the borough : but the observations beforemade, with respect to Exeter, Barnstaple, Oakhampton, andTotness, apply equally to this place, and therefore need notbe here repeated.It should be further remarked, that in many parts of thereturns for this county, there seems to be a studied variationin the use of the terms, " tenet" and " habet ;* the formerseems generally to be applied to freemen entered as belongingto the manors in the county at large ; the latter appearsto be usually applied to the burgesses, as if describing actualoccupation.CORNWALL.Of the one-and-twenty boroughs which existed in Cornwall,the greater part of them occur in Domesday, but none aredescribed as boroughs, nor are their burgesses mentioned ; —circumstances, which will be hereafter explained by thedates of the several charters granted to those places, atmuch later periods.LONDON.—WESTMINSTER. I73Domesday.MIDDLESEX.LONDON, WESTMINSTER.The return for Middlesex, is subject to almost the sameobservation, as Cornwall ; — there is no borough mentionedwithin it, nor any material entry with respect to burgesses ;being chiefly confined to one, respecting some burgesses ofLondon ; and others of the manor of Staines ; but to whatplace they belonged, is not distinctly specified. And thereis no document to shew that Staines ever was a borough, noris it mentioned as such either by Camden, Lambert, or anyother author.It is a striking circumstance, that London should not beentered in Domesday book, either separately, or in thecounty of Middlesex ; the latter, however, may perhapsbe explained, by its being always separated from thatcounty. The former is not so easy of solution, unlessit be explained, as has been suggested by Sir Henry Ellis,*that it had peculiar and extensive privileges granted to it,before the compilation of Domesday; — a suggestion, theprobability of which is somewhat confirmed by the fact — thatWinchester, like London— one of the most considerablecities in the earliest periods of our history — ^is not mentionedas a borough in Domesday; but the burgesses only arereferred to, in almost the same manner as those of London :and Winchester had its own separate Domesday book, calledthe Book of Winton, to which we have before alluded.See Sir H. Ellis' Introduct. to Domesday Book, vol. i. p. 190. 1833.174. HERTFORD.Domesday.HERTFORDSHIRE.HERTFORD, ST. Allan's.In Hertfordshire, there were only two parliamentaryboroughs, — Hertford and St. Allan's; both of which arementioned in Domesday: the latter only by its burgesses.But of the former, there is a lengthened separate entry,preceding the returns for the county.HERTFORD.Fol. 132. Hertford is described as having been a borough in thetime of King Edward; and then possessing 146 burgessesin the soke of King Edward.After which follows the singular expression, strongly connectingthe burgesses with their houses, — ^^ Of theses EarlAlan has now three h<mses, which then and now rendercustom*'Eudo Napier has two houses, which were Altars ; andthen and now rendered custom. And the same Eudo hasathird house which was Ulnar's, not rendering custom.Goesfrid de Beech three houses rendering custom. HumoredAnsleuile holds under Eudo, two houses with a garden:of these, one was let to a certain reeve of the king ; andanother with the garden, was of a certain burgess; and nowthe burgesses themselves reclaim these, as unjustly takenfrom them — again expressly connecting the burgesses withthe houses.King William has eighteen other burgesses, who werethe men of Earl Harold and Earl Leuuirri, rendering allcustoms.The rest of the entry continues much in the same form ;and at the close of it, the suburb is mentioned.Villains and servi are spoken of in this county, as in theformer ; and also workmen.Among the lands of the Abbey of Westminster, it is entered,HERTFORD AND ST. ALBAN's. 175that the abbot holds Sewell ;* and there are stated to be Po^Mday.there, 14 burgesses : and there are 49 shillings and four pence Hertfordthe toll and other customs of the borough.Among the lands of the church of St. Allan's, is enteredthe town of St. Alarms; 46 burgesses^ and 11 pound 14shillings a year of the toll, and other rents of the town ; andthat the burgesses have half a hide.Among the lands of Earl Moreton in Keung Hundred foi.i36,b.is entered Berkhampstead. In Burbio (which probablymeans, in the suburb of that town), there are 62 burgesses^who render four pounds of toll ; but there is no further mentionof them, nor to what borough they belong. Ten mer" FoI. 137.chants are spoken of at Cestrehunt.Amongst the land of Ralph, the brother of Ilger, inMachines Hundred, the entry of Stanestede mentions seven Fol miss, b.burgesses.Among the lands of the king's thanes in HertfordHundred, there is an entry, that Peter, a certain burgess, Fol. 142.holds two hides of the king, in Dodesdone.From these entries, it is clear, that burgesses had existedin Hertford from the time of King Edward, and that theywere the householders ; — houses and burgesses being convertibleterms, excepting where the house paid no custom.Of the burgesses of St. Allan nothing material is mentioned,nor of those of Shell, Berkhampsted or Stanstede.It however appears by the entry of the land of the king'sthanes, th at a barge ss held lands in Modest one ; which isconfirmatory^oT the suggestion we have before made, thatalthough the burgesses ei^terei-in the. several manpxg^heliof them, they did not reside in the manor, but in the borough,ofwluch we shall have hereafter a striking instance inChester. And that the reader may be satisfied that the mer .chants were not the burgesses, as supposed by many writers,we have a separate entry in this county of 10 merchants,which occurs also in Berkshire, — ^in Nottingham, — chester, —and there is an entry of the men of the market of Testesin Staffordshire. As the survey of Hertford so clearly• Athwcll. fo. 136.\ 1176 HERTFORD.Domesday. identifies the burgesses with their houses, we shall hereHertford trace the further history of that borough, for the purpose ofestablishing, that the inhabitant householders were the realburgesses of Hertford.1297. This place returned members to Parliament 26th Edward Lwho were elected per communicated burgensium; and itcontinued to send members from that time to the 60th of1376. Edward III.1331. In the 6th year of Edward III. the castle and borough ofHertford were extended, and the jury find that they wereheld, in capite, of the king. And as the castle and boroughare mentioned separately, it appears to confirm the positionwe have before adopted, that the castles were, generallyseparate from the borough.We have also, in the same document, some account ofthe elections of the municipal officers. The jury say, thatthe bailiff of Hertford ought to be elected by the commonaltyand the town ; who make their election every year,in the court next after the Feast of Michaelmas, as well ofthe bailiff and sub-bailiff, as of all their other officers.Michaelmas was the time when the court leet was held ; andthere can be little doubt but that these elections were madein that court, according to the general law and practice ofthe country.After the reign of Edward III. Hertford only sent members1419. in the 3d and 10th of Richard II. and the 7th of Henry V.1468. In the 7th of Edward IV. the sheriff of Hertfordshire returned,that there was no city or borough in his county fromwhence any citizens or burgesses could be elected. Theprobability is, that either the population was so reducedthat they could no longer hold their courts, and continuetheir borough rights; or that they were too poor to pay thewages of their members, and therefore, for a time, relinquishedthe liberties and privileges of their borough.1553. But in the first year of Queen Mary, a charter was obtainedupon a humble petition from the inhabitants of thisborough, whereby the Queen granted that it should be incorporated,of one bailiff and burgesses; and that the inha-V.HERTFORD. 177biianis, by the name of the bailiffs and burgesses, should be Po^g^^y-a body corporate, &c. Hertford-thecharter further granted to the bailiff, the power ofadmitting as burgesses all such jnen, tenants, and inhabitantswithin the borough, as should be necessary for itsgovernment.This clause from the charter of Mary, giving to the bailiffthe power of making burgesses, requires some remarks. Wehave already seen, from the Saxon laws, that it was theduty of the king's officer in every borough, to take care thatall the inhabitants within it should be duly sworn, and givetheir pledges — which they were bound to do after they hadbeen in the borough 40 days; and if they did not do so withinthe year, they would be presented by the jury at the CourtLeet. To the former part of this law there was, at thatperiod, an exception as to villains, who, belonging to otherlords, were not bound to do this suit and service, unless,they had resided in the borough away from their lords,more than a year and a day. As long, therefore, asthe doctrine of villainage continued to exist, and in practice,it was a question very material for the officer of theborough to consider, — ^whether any particular person whomhe was about to swear as a burgess, was or was not afreeman ; for if he were not, the officer might render himselfliable to an action by the lord of the villain, for havingwithdrawn his villain or having received him as a fugitive.The last instance, however, of villainage is in the reignof Henry VIII. In that of Queen Mary, therefore, this headof the law had become in a great degree obsolete, and therewas no longer any reason — either why the crown should not,with respect to the rights of the lord, grant such a clause aswas contained in the charter of Queen Mary ; nor why thebailiff, or king's officer, should not act upon it, by admittingany person who was an inhabitant householder within the boroughto be a free bui^ess; it being clear that he must beafreeman, inasmuch as villainage had ceased. This is thereal explanation of these clauses, which were at that timefirst introduced, and which, with the change of the law,VOL. I. N178 HERTFORD.Domesday. Ought to have* put an end to all the distinctions of freedom"^'l^ire** "^y birth, service, or marriage; all persons, after the reign cfHenry VIII. being, in point of fact, free*As a further proof that the grant of the queen did notinterfere with the right of election — ^in confirmation of thedoctrine laid down in Glanville's Reports — it should be observed,that, notwithstanding this charter, the burgesses didnot return members to Parliament till 1624, the 22d James L,when it was directed that they should do so by a committee,to whose proceedings we shall hereafter refer.1606. In the 3d year of the reign of James L, that king granteda charter to the mayor and burgesses of Hertford, recitingthat it was an ancient and populous borough ; and that theburgesses had, by different names, enjoyed divers liberties,as well by charter as by prescription ; that the bailiffs andburgesses had petitioned to be made a body-corporate, bythe name of the Mayor, Burgesses and Commonalty," whichwas accordingly granted, with the usual corporate powers:and amongst other things, it was directed, that ten of thebetter and most worthy inhabitants who were to be the capitalburgesses, should be of the common council ; that thereshould be 16 of the most discreet men of the commonaltywho should be assistants to the mayor; and the first tencapital burgesses appointed, are described as inhabitants.The other provisions of the charter resemble those of thatperiod, and are in spirit and effect the same as that ofQueen Mary ; excepting than they are more lengthened andnumerous. It does not appear that the clause in thegrant of that Queen, as to the making of - burgesses, isrepeated in this charter.*1624. In the 22d of James I., the right of Hertford to returnmembers to Parliament, after its long discontinuance, wasbrought before the celebrated committee, the proceedingsof which are reported by Mr. Serjeant Glanville by fourseveral petitions from the boroughs of Amersham, Marlow,Wendover, and Hertford ; stating, that they were ancientVide post. p. 180. t Page 87, et aeq.HERTFORD. 179parliamentary boroughs, and ought to send members to Par Po»wdty«lament ; and complaining that the sheriffs had for a long Hertford-timeneglected to send warrants to them for electing members.These petitions being held material, the mattersthereof were seriously examined and discussed by the committee.Mr. Hakeyill was counsel for the boroughs ; andSir Robert Heath, the solicitor-general, was one of thecommittee; who after a long debate alleged, that informnation had been given to his majesty, that very manyboroughs in several parts of the realm might make thelike claim, which might peradventure give occasion of offenceto his majesty, and cumber the House with an excessiveand unnecessary number. Mr. Noy and Mr. Selden wereordered to make search among the records concerning thisbusiness, and to report what they found. AccordinglyMr. Selden reported, that there were but two boroughsunrestored, standing in the like case with these : whereuponthe committee proceeded to the further hearing ofthe matters in question ; and in the bundle of returns ofthose who were summoned to the council or parliament atNorthampton, in the 1st of Edward I., the names of theburgesses who served for these four boroughs were mentioned; and in the schedule to the writ for the county ofHertford, in the 26th of Edward I., two burgesses are 1297.returned for the Borough of Hertford. The other threeplaces also sent members in the 28th Edward I. ; but no 1299.records were produced from the 28th EdwaM L till thetime of the hearing of the case, being kii interval of 326years.Upon this the committee were of opinion, "that theseboroughs ever had a right to send burgesses to Parliament : "for these reasons, first, that the right to return membersought to be proved by matter of record out of the returnsand rolls of memorandums touching former parliaments, andother matters of record ; secondly, that the returns producedwere sufficient proof that these boroughs had once sentmembers to parliament, however they came since to be discontinued; and it appears that the main objection to theirN 2180 HERTFORD.Domesday, returning was the long discontinuance and disuse, in notHertford sending burgesses for above 300 years ; for which, their poverty,in not being able to pay the wages of their members,was suggested as an excuse ; and it was added, that as theywere contented to undergo that burden, there was no reasonto deny their petition. And, lastly, it was urged in behalfof the boroughs, that the liberty of sending burgesses toparliament, is one of that nature and quality that it cannotbe lost by neglect ; and if such a neglect may be permittedin one, so may it be in more, and consequently in allthe boroughs of England ; and then it might follow, that, forwant of burgesses, there should be no parliament ; andas for these boroughs, it did anciently appear that theywere parliament boroughs by prescription and not by charfer ; for every of them had their several foreins^ and didpay ffteenSy as parliamentary boroughs, and not as otherboroughs or towns. It appears that the king, before theseresolutions were reported to the House, sent to the two chiefjustices for their opinions on this points whereupon theycertified his majesty that it was just writs should beawarded.In the Journals,* it is also mentioned, that a statute in thereign of Edward I. recited that Hertford then served in parliament.aiJ^it Notwithstanding the above statement, of there being acharter to Hertford in the third year of James I., the readershould be infomi^, that none of that date is to be foundupon the roll of charters at the Rolls Chapel; but there isone of James II., in the fourth year of his reign, " incorporatingthe burgesses and inhabitants." However, it is statedupon the Joumal8,t and also by Carew, that " a charterwas granted by James I. to Hertford — reciting, that it was"an ancient borough; and that the burgesses had, byseveral names, enjoyed divers ancient liberties and franchises,as well by divers letters patent of former kingsand queens, as well as by divers prescriptions and customs.And, granting that, the mayor and capital burgesses• Jour. G97. t Jour. 708.iiuuHERTFORD. 181should have power to make as many of the inhabitants of Dmwday."the borough, or the parishes, burgesses, as they should Hertford-thinknecessary or profitable for the borough — so only thatthe burgesses inhabiting without the borough, should notat any time exceed three."Upon the former part of the clause we have already observed,in the charter of Queen Mary. As to the exceptionin favour of three non-residents, contained both in thischarter and that of Mary, it is probably to be explainedby the usage of making the members j in conformity with theparliamentary writ, " burgesses," — ^and also, the having acompetent person to be the steward or recorder who, as a lawyer,would in all likelihood not reside in the borough.In 1618, there was a mandamus issued by the Court 1618.of King's Bench, to restore a burgess, of the name ofClark,* who had been expelled from his franchise for usingcontemptuous language to the mayor, which was held nojust cause of removal — and therefore he was ordered to berestored.In 1640, there appears to have been a petition from the 1640]freeholders and freemen of the county and borough of thetown of Hertford ; but nothing Was done upon it.In 1690, there was also a petition of the inhabitants, 1690.stating, that before any charter was granted to them, theyhad sent members to Parliament, who were elected by theinhabitants: that, in 1681, the mayor, and some of the 1681.corporation, granted freedoms to great numbers of clergymen,and others, living remote, in order to outweigh theinhabitants and legal voters of the borough ; and that at thelast election many of these honorary freemen were, notwithstandingexception taken to them by the inhabitants,admitted to poll, — of which the inhabitants complained, astending to destroy their ancient privileges.Certainly they could not have resorted to a more unconstitutionalcourse — one more contrary to law, or more likelyto introduce great and mischievous abuses — of which toomany instances afterwards occurred in other boroughs. ItCro. Jac. 506.€iUtl182 HERTFORD.Domwdfty. xQxist be added, with regret, that they have been too muchHertford protected and sanctioned by the courts, and committeesof the House of Commons.1098. However this particular abuse at Hertford seems to havebeen speedily brought under the consideration of the courtsand to have met with the indignant condemnation of thethen chief justice, Lord Holt — ^that sound and constitutionallawyer. The report is as follows : — *^ After several motionsand debates at the bar, leave was given by the court tofile an information, in nature of a quo warranto, in thename of the attorney-general, against the mayor andaldermen of Hertford to know by what warrant they admitpersons who did not reside within the borough to the freedomof the corporation. And Holt, chief justice, said, that*' if the defendants were found guilty, they should be fined"*1700. Notwithstanding the strong intimation of Lord Holt, itappears, in 1700, two years afterwards, from a petition ofsome of the inhabitants, — ^that the mayor, at the election permittedseveral pretended freemen to poll, who were arbitrarilyand contrary to their charter made so, in the first yearof James IL In consequence of which, the inhabitants complainedto the Parliament, in the first year of the reign ofKing William; and the then mayor, and several of thealdermen, promising to desist from those practices for thefixture, the petitioners abstained from further proceedings.The mayor, and some of the aldermen, having again violatedthe rights and privileges of the borough ; one of the1701. candidates in the next year, presented a petition, in whichhe complained, that the mayor had admitted great numbersto poll who had no right to vote, not beii^ '' inhabitants, inwhom the ancient right of electing was, before the chartersof incorporation were granted ; nor having been inhabitantsof the borough, or the parishes thereof, when swornburgesses — without which qualification, the mayor aptaldermen had no power to make them."

Ray. 426.autlHERTFORD. 183The inhabitants also in a petition fitted, (as the feet is,) Po»«<^y-that the mayor and aldermen were only empowered, by the Hertford-chaisewe have before observed upon, to make as many burgessesand freemen as they should think fit, of the ^* inhabitants" of the borough ; and not above three in being at atime of the inhabitants of the parishes : yet the mayor andaldermen, a short time before the Parliament held in thefirst of James II., did arbitrarily make great numbersof persons, who were neither inhabitants of the borough norparishes, freemen or free burgesses, who being admitted topoll at that election, and for the Parliament held the firstof William and Mary— several of the now petitioners complainedof the said practices ; upon which, the then mayor .and aldermen promising to forbear the like for the fixture,if the petitioners would not prosecute the said petition, theydesisted : but the last mayor and majority of aldermen havemade more such freemen ; and the now mayor, at the late ;election of members for this present Parliament, did admitas many of the pretended burgesses to poll as offered themselves.Upon these petitions, the committee repkM7 ^^^^^the right of election was the point controverted, — the petitionersinsisting that it was in the inhabitants — and thesitting itnember, that it was in the burgesses or freemen, aswell as in the inhabitants. And another question was — ^howthose ought to be qualified who were made free.The charters of Queen Mary and King James were read inevidence, — though it is clear from the decisive authorities inOlanville's Reports, that they could not, in any degree, haveaffected the right of election ; but that the burgesses whowere entitled to vots^ must be the same class as those whovoted at the elections in the reigns of Edward I., Edward II.and Edward III.The returns of the 26th of Edward I., by the commonaltyof the burgesses; and that of the 13th of Charles II., whichwas by the 16 burgesses who were assistants, and all theother inhabitants of the borough; and admissions of freedomalso from 1640 to 1678, under the charter of King James,were given in evidence; with some in 1695, 1697 and 1700;184 HERTFORD.Domesday. j^^ parol testimony as to the usage of the borough,^ »hi°^**' fixing the time when honorary freemen were first admittedto vote, to have been about 40 years before that period;that previously they had not voted, — but ever since had beenadmitted.For the sitting member, contrary to all proof and generalhistory, and the facts of this particular borough — ^which wasnot incorporated till the reign of Queen Mary — it was insistedthat Hertford was both a borough and a corporation by prescription; and they produced an ancient book to show, thatpersons living out of the borough, as well as inhabitants, weremade free in 1596, 1698, 1600, 1606 and 1612. But thesewere admitted, as appears from the journal, for the purposesof trade, — being brewers, — fishmongers, — shoemakers, &c.They also produced in evidence the returns of the 3d ofCharles I., by the mayor, stewards, assistants, burgesses andtown clerk; also, two returns of the 13th Charles II.; andto prove the usage of the borough, they called a formerrecorder, who spoke to the elections from 1669, at all ofwhich the freemen had voted ; and that Sir William Cooperwas carried by the freemen ; and also stated he found many-gentlemenmade free before he knew the town. Anotherwitness said, that he had known Hertford ever since 1665;that he never knew any honorary freemen refused or scrupledj-^-that he had voted, though he lived out of the town ;and he added, — ^that honorary freemen never concernedthemselves in any other business of the town, but elections.It is impossible not to feel surprise, that the committeedid not instantly express their indignation at so palpable abreach of the freedom of election, it being evident — that thesenon-resident freemen were colourably made, in direct violationof the express words of the charter, for the purpose of controllingthe election; and were never, on any other occasions,treated as real burgesses, by being allowed to participate inany of the municipal elections or transactions of the borough.By which means the whole object of the charters (which,recognising the inhabitants as burgesses, were in conformitywith the ancient usages of the burgh) was defeated ; and theHERTFORD. 185residents for whose benefit they were intended were con ^""^^^y-trolled in the exercise of the important privilege, of electing Hertford-theirmembers to Parliament, by the non-residents, who wereexpressly excluded by the charters.Notwithstanding this plain and obvious answer to thecase insisted upon by the sitting member, the committeeresolved, — ^that the right of election was not in such freemenonly as are inhabitants, householders of the borough, and insuch freemen as at the time of their freedom being grantedwere inhabitants of the borough or parish j — but that theright was in all the freemen, and inhabitants being housekeepers.The effect of which decision was— to allow the non-residentsto vote, without any pretence of right, except avery suspicious usage from the time of the Restoration ; thewords of the charter, which must be taken as accordingwith the ancient usages of the borough, being directlyopposed to them.Besides, there is this absurdity resulting from thisdecision : — ^that being properly confined, as far as related tothe inhabitants, to householders, it excluded some of theactual inhabitants of the place: but as regarded the freemen,there was no such restriction ; and therefore a non-residentfreeman might vote, not being an inhabitant, whilst someof the inhabitants were excluded.There was added to the resolution, a further qualificationthat they should not receive alms ; — but that is the generalrestriction of the common law, applicable to all places.In 1705, another petition was presented by some of the yj^^^inhabitants as well as the candidate; and the same question,as to the right of the inhabitants and the freemen, was againdiscussed before the committee. The same charters, returns,and admissions were again produced in evidence, and nearlythe same testimony as before on the part of the sitting member; excepting that it appeared more distinctly than on aformer occasion, that ih& foreigners had been admitted asfreemen, for the purpose of carrying on particular trades.This committee, correcting the error of the former, decidedin conformity with the charters, that '^ the right was in thePigg ST.ALBAN's.Po"<^*^y' " inhabitants, and such freemen only, as at the time of theirHertford ** being made free were inhabitants of the borough or the** parishes; the number of the freemen living out of theborough not exceeding three."In the course of the evidence, in confirmation of what wehave before observed with respect to castles, it was assertedthat Culling's Rents were part of the old castle, and neverreputed part of the borough.1723. In 1723, upon another petition, the right determined in1705 was agreed to be the right of election; and evidencewas again given, that the castle was always esteemed to bewithout the borough.In this manner the right of election has ever since beenexercised.So that, with the exception of continuing the freemen asvoters — whose peculiar right is founded upon the obsoletelaw of villainage, and ought not therefore now to be continued— the privilege of being burgesses at Hertford is at thepresent day the same as it was in the time of our Saxonancestors, in the inhabitants, being householders. The freemenbeing also required to be inhabitants. This distinctioncan lead to but little practical inconvenience, as the probabilityis, that the greater portion of them would be householders.ST. ALBAN's.The burgesses of St. Allan's having, like those of Hertford,been eventually determined in substance to be the inhabitanthouseholders ; and as it is the only other boroughin Hertfordshire, we shall pursue the history of this placethrough the various periods to the present time.St. Allan's is one of our most ancient boroughs, and inthe reign of King John, there was a charter granted to theabbey. It was a borough, when members were first returnedto parliament in the reign of Edward I.; but it doesnot appear that it was summoned in the 23d year of that1300. reign. In the 28th of Edward I., 1300, the sheriff ofHertford returned, that he had sent a precept to the bailiff,ST. ALBAN's. 187who had given him no return. But in the 36th Edward L, Po'ne^^y-St. Allan's sent two members ; and also in the Ist and 5th HertfordEdward 11. The following year, they had no preceptsent to them as appears from a petition in the 8th of Ed ^J^^^f jward Ii,* in which the burgesses say, " that although theyhold their town in capite of the king, and as other boroughs,ought to send two comburgesses, as had been accustomed,nevertheless, the sheriff of Hertfordshire, at the procurementand in favour of the abbot, had altogether refused to summonor return the burgesses."The answer to which petition is, that the rolls of Chanceryshould be searched, whether the burgesses of St. Allan's hadbeen accustomed to come or not, and then justice should bedone to them.Taking the words of this petition literally, it would seemto import, that St. Allan's had returned members to Parliamentbefore the reign of Edward I., which Mr. Prynne properlysuggests is inaccurate ; and there can be no doubt butthat such a supposition is altogether incorrect. However, itwould certainly be an extraordinary fact, that even suchgeneral words should occur in a document of so early a date,if it could not in some degree be explained.But any person familiar with the early records of thiscountry must be aware, that such general words, referringto the acts of former kings, and to the enjoyment of ancientrights, frequently occur in cases where they can be clearlyshown as being inaccurate and unfounded, if taken literally —and can only be satisfactorily explained, by treating them asintended, merely to import — an enjoyment of rights, for aconsiderable time, and beyond living memory.In the 6th year of Edward III., the men of St. Allan's disappearto have suffered from the control which the abbotexercised over them, in consequence of the charter he hadgranted ;f and therefore 31 persons, described as men of thetoto, for themselves, and the other men of the tom, broughtinto Chancery a charter granted to them by the abbot ofSt. Allan's, praying that it might be cancelled, —-the• Par. Rot. n. 253. t Mad. Fir. Burg. 140.188 ST. ALBAN's.DomegcUy. enrolment of it withdrawn, — ^and renouncing all libertiesHertford and privileges under it,I4(yj. It appears from a case in the Year Book of this date,* thatthe Abbot of St. Allan's held the franchise of the town at thistime (probably in consequence of the above surrender) ; andthat he had three bailiffs, — a gaol, — and a Court Leet.The burgesses, however, in succeeding reigns, acquired7 Ed^vi V^^^^S^ ^'^^ themselves ; and in the 7th year of Edward VL,upon the petition of the men and inhabitants, obtained acharter, incorporating them, and directing that it should beafree borough and a corporation, with the usual corporatepowers. That there should be ten of the more discreet and^^^^' honest men of the borough who should be assistants to the/T V ^ mayor, and should be the common council. And that themayor and principal burgesses might admit such otherburgesses, of the most honest inhabitants as they shouldthink fit.The charter then provided, that all persons who then orthereafter should inhabit in the borough, and who should bejustices of the peace, within the liberties of St. Allan's, notusing or exercising any art, occupation, or victualling, shouldnot be accounted burgesses, nor allowed to intermeddle byauthority of the commission of the peace, but should remainin all respects ^a foreigners.This is a singular and unusual clause, but affording inferencesto illustrate the practice and history of municipal bodies.It seems to have arisen from the peculiar jurisdiction overthe liberty of St. Allan's — the justices of which, it is assumed,might wish to reside in the borough ; and this clauseappears to have been intended to give them the opportunityof doing so, but at the same time to exclude them from allmunicipal rights and interference — affording pregnant inferencethat all persons residing in the place, — ^were it notfor such a special provision as this, — would have been entitledto be burgesses, and to enjoy all the municipal privileges,and particularly as the clause expressly excepts such justicesas were engaged in trade, to whom it might be espe-• Year Book, vi. 17 a.ST.

Piggdaily important to share in the privileges of the borough, ^^""^"^y-The clause for the return of members to Parliament which Hertford-shouldalways be considered as confirmatory of the previousright, rather than as a new grant — particularly where placeshave returned members before, as St. Allan's had done — ^isin the same form as similar , clauses in numerous othercharters, recognising the right of election in the burgesses, —such burgesses being in this instance, as the charter imports,and as the subsequent documents with respect to this boroughwill prove, '^ The Inhabitants of the Town," andfarther directs, that the burgesses should go to Parliamentin the same manner and form as in other boroughs. Theclear object and assumption of all these provisions being, ^ . .^^ that all the boroughs should be upon the same footing."The first mayor, and the 10 principal burgesses, are thenrespectively appointed, and are described as inhabitants. Inthe clause for the annual election of the mayor, it is provided,that two of the principal burgesses shall be nominated tothe inhabitants that they may elect one of them'' From ^which it is obvious, that the inhabitants were treated as thegeneral body of the burgesses ; and the same provision ismade as to the election upon the death or removal of themayor.Another clause directs, that one of the burgesses should beelected chamberlain; and another, that if any of the principalburgesses should die, or dwell out of the borough, orberemoved, other inhabitants were to be appointed in theirstead. Many other provisions are contained in this charter,but none of them are material to the present inquiry, exceptingthat, as usual, a Court Leet, or view frank-pledge, isgranted ; and also the return of writs, which exempts themfrom the jurisdiction of the sheriff; and the inhabitants areexempted from serving on juries.It should also be observed, that the sum paid for the grantof a church is paid by the inhabitants, and it is made tothem by their corporate name of '^ the mayor and burgesses "early establishing the identity of the two.190 ST. ALB AN 'S.Domesday, ^^ ^^^^ ^q^ oBttit also to mention that notwithstandingHertford the inhoMtonts are described in the charter to be the bur-shire.guesses and they have always been so treated, yet theborough is expressly directed to be held in " free burgage;"and if there were really any ground for that species oftenure interfering with the rights of burgess-ships. Albanianlike London, and all the other boroughs, must have had aburgfi^ tenure qualification for burgesses, for they were allheld in the same manner. Towards the close of the charterthere is a particular provision — ^that the gaol of the liberty ofSt. Allan's might be within the borough.1632. In 1632, another charter was granted to St* Allan's, recitingthat of Edward VI., and that, upon the petition of themayor and burgesses, with a view of removing certain defectsand doubts in that charter, the king had granted, for their explanationand amendment, and for the confirmation of theirancient liberties, a new description of their limits, with apower of perambulating; and added besides, that there shouldbe 16 principal burgesses and 24 assistants, but giving theirelection to the mayor and principal burgesses, with particularprovision for the election of the high steward — recorder —coroner— common clerk — and four attorneys of the court ofrecord, who were required to be freemen of the borough.The steward was to be elected by the mayor and principalburgesses; — the recorder, by the mayor and burgesses atlarge; — the coroner and attorneys, (five freemen,) to beappointed by the mayor and principal burgesses. And thepower of making bye-laws is given to the same body.The usual clause against the trading of foreigners, not freeof the borough, is inserted.The inhabitants were exempted generally fix>m serving onjuries without the borough. And no freemcui who hadserved the office of mayor, was to be compelled to bear armsat musters.So that the important feature of this charter appears tobe, that the municipal elections were chiefly given to themayor and principal burgesses,lec^ii. Charles IL also granted to the mayor and burgesses ofST. ALBAN's. 191St. Allan's, on their petition a new charter — incorporating '^""^y-them anew by the name of " the Mayor, Aldermen, and HertfordAnd — for the keeping of the peace and governmentof the borough, of the people inhabiting, andothers coming — granted it should be a free borough;that the mayor and burgesses should be a body corporate,with the usual corporate powers; that one of themost honest and discreetly men of the borough should bechosen mayor — 12 of the most honest and discreetly mento be aldermen for life — and to be the common council,eth the jurisdiction, privileges, &c., that the principalburgesses heretofore had ; and 24 assistants were to bechosen by the mayor and aldermen, to assist them.The same offices, of high steward, recorder, coroner, anda common clerk, and four attorneys, are appointed.That there should be there four expert and fit men, beingfreemen of the borough, who should be called attorneys ofthe court of record.That the mayor and aldermen, after the death or removalof the then present common clerk, might nominate and preferone other fit person, out of the freemen and inhabitantsto be the common clerk.The mayor and aldermen to make bye-laws, for the goodgovernment of the borough, and of all officers, ministers,artificers, burgesses, inhabitants, residents, &c.A fair and a court of pie powder was also granted.The usual clause is inserted that no foreigner out of the Iter"ties of the town, might henceforth (except in open marketsor fairs) buy and sell any merchandise, &c., except victuals,within the borough, by parcels or retail, unless one of theparties contracting be of the liberty of the same borough,nor use any mystery, occupation, or handicraft, within theborough, or liberty thereof. And that none who inhabitedwithin the borough, be impannelled upon any juries, &c.without the borough.This charter is, therefore, in substance the same as thatof Charles I., and gives the power of electing to the mayorand aldermen, as that charter had, to the mayor and principeST. ALBAN's.Domesday. p^] burgesses. In other respects it resembles, in object andHertford effect, the charter of Charles I., excepting that, in the clausesliircwhich relates to buying and selling within the borough,foreigners are spoken of as persons out of the libertiescontra-distinguished from persons of the liberties.lacarfil. ^ ^^y ^^ bye-laws, made by the mayor and aldermenin 1666, was approved of, under the statute of Henry VII.,by the lord chancellor and the two chief justices.The first related to the day for the election of mayor; andrequired that all the householders should be warned, at theirrespective dwelling houses, to attend at the election, andgive their voices. The assistants, and rest of the inhidnt^ants were to elect a mayor out of two of the aldermen, tobe nominated by the mayor and aldermen. Throughoutseveral succeeding bye-laws, the '' inhabitants " are repeatedlyspoken of as the body who are to join in the election:and in the second bye-law, they are described as the '' comemanly aforesaid*' Persons are prohibited from fillingthe higher offices of the corporation who were known tohave been guilty of any immoral conduct, or of having beenconvicted of any notorious or infamous fault : — ^a provisionas consistent with good and orderly government, as it wasconformable to the early Saxon laws.The companies in St. Allan's, and their wardens, are spokenof; but they appear to be, as we have before observed ofthe guilds — distinct and separate from the borough ormunicipal rights.The superior officers were required to be resident and dietswithin the borough.The four wards of the borough, are also spoken of; andall strangers and newcomers were directed to be warned tothe court of the mayor and aldermen ; there to give security,according to the Saxon system, for all charges that might happento be put on the inhabitants by reason of such strangersabode or inhabiting within the borough ; or by reason of thewife, child, or children's birth, or dwelling of any of themwithin it ; and such as are not free of the borough.Power is also given to the mayor and aldermen to admitST. ALBANS. 193and take into the society of freemen all persons who, not Po"«^y-having served for such freedom, but desiring to come in by Hertford-redemption,require to be admitted and made free, and willcome to the monthly courts to make their request for thatpurpose. And if the alderman shall think such person tobe a needful and necessary man to be admitted, and theyapprove of him, he shall be admitted upon paying the sumof 6/.The reader will perceive, how directly this bye-law is inconformitywith the Saxon institutions — putting the admission C ''of the party into the borough, upon the ground of goodreputation — and on making a reasonable contribution to thepublic stock of the town. It will be seen hereafter, thatthis is in direct conformity with the ancient custumalsof the cinque ports.The bye-laws afterwards proceed to engraft upon thesesimple provisions, some of modem intricacy, relative to thesons of aldermen, — ^which, in another part, are applied to allfreemen, — and the particular rights of the elder son, — uponwhich we have observed before.Violent conduct or language of the aldermen, or any ofthe ^* inhabitants against the mayor and aldermen, wherebythe king's peace, or brotherly love or affection, might bebroken or impaired, was subjected to a forfeiture. Provisionis also made for payment, by the freemen, of all quarteredand forfeitures incurred by them.All the crasis and occupations within the borough, were tobe divided between the mercers and iron-holders.Freemen, and all other inhabitants, dwelling within theborough, except apprentices and servants, were to aid andassist the mayor, serjeants-at-mace, constables, and all otherofficers within the borough. Every person coming to inhabitwithin the borough, except men of known nobility andworth, was to bring a testimonial, from the place from whencehe came, of his honesty and good behaviour; and givesecurity, for the protection of the borough, — to which wehave before adverted.All persons then residing within the borough, not havingVOL. I. o194 ST. ALBAN's.DoTOoida y. remained there for the space of half a year, were to do theHertford, same. — those not so doing, were to be compelled or drivenout of the borough ; and he who received them, was to paya forfeit of 405, — adopting precisely, the directions of theSaxon laws.There were provisions for a general assembly of the wardensof the company, and all the freemen, four times in the year —Christmas, Easter, Midsummer, and Michaelmas — ^for theview and correction of the business of the companies —enrolling freemen — and payment of quartered. Every freemaninhabiting within the borough, was directed to pay hisquartered ; and there were further ordinances respecting thefreemen. The constables were required to make diligentsearch, monthly, for every person that had come to inhabitwithin the borough, and all strangers remaining there, undera penalty. Two viewers were to be every year chosenfrom the inhabitants of each of the four wards, to presentall encroachments to the mayor and aldermen.It is obvious from this extract, that the viewers andmayor and aldermen, were then exercising, through themedium of the sessions, the original jurisdiction of the CourtLeet, — ^which will be a strong confirmation of what we havebefore observed, that the select bodies of aldermen, capitalburgesses, and assistants, were, in point of fact, derived,originally, from the grand and petty juries of the Court Leet.The next provision related to the swearing of freemen,another branch of the duty of the Court Licet ; and establishes,— ^that the admission of freemen, — though so generallyconsidered a corporate act, — is, in truth, nothing but theancient law respecting the Leet, which can alone justifythe administration of such an oath.The next provided, that no stranger, inhabiting out of theborough, was to be made free of it, or have recourse there asafreeman, so long as he should be non-resident within it,whereby to hinder the freemen inhabiting within the borough,of their trade of living ; except with victuals, and on fairdays.Excellent rules were made for the proper use and cuss.Albans.1700.tody of the town seal — the due entry of the names of the d««^^^freemen — the binding of apprentices, — and other matters ^2^^**"*"of minute detail, into which it is not necessary to enter;the whole concluding with the form of oaths to betakenby the respective officers upon entering into office.Such is the result of the documents having relation to themunicipal government of St. Allan's. * ^In the beginning of the last century, the parliamentaryright of election became the subject of frequent discussion.In 1700, it was insisted by the petitioner, to be in themayor, aldermen, freemen, and such householders only aspaid scot and lot. On the other hand, it was contended bythe sitting member, that all householders, whether theypaid scot and lot or not, were entitled to vote. Thetown clerk spoke to the usage for 20 years; that those whodid not pay scot and lot had been allowed to poll, in orderto hinder tumults; but that they were queried, and by reasonof the great majority on one side it had never been contested ;yet he owned the freemen had a right to vote withoutpaying. Other evidence was given for 60 years, to showthat all the householders had voted, though it appearsexception had been taken to them.It is impossible to pass on from this evidence withoutobserving upon its unsatisfactory nature : amounting onlyto slight proof of a doubtful and questionable usage,and that only for a short period. There is a difficulty in iconceiving how such evidence could be adopted, respecting Ia right commencing in the reign of Edward I.; — more especiallywhen it is remembered, that the payment of scotand lot was expressly required by the common law, asearly as the reign of William the first; and, therefore,the evidence of this usage was admitted to negative thecommon law; the practice, at the best, having alwaysbeen disputed. As a striking instance to establish howunsatisfactory the reception of evidence of usage is, in questionsrespecting the parliamentary right of election, itshould be noted, — ^that the polling of the householders notpaying scot and lot was not investigated, because theo2196 ST. Albans.^^■^^y- majority was so great as to render it unnecessary. So***jjjj^*^^" that, at all events, evidence of usage of this descriptionshould be confined to those cases only, where it was theinterest of parties to discuss the point.In answer to this case, relied upon by the sitting member,the counsel for the petitioners most properly rested solelyupon law and reason, not calling any witnesses : and contended,that by the law of the land all persons ought to payscot and lot ; and that it was reasonable — that those onlywho contributed to the chaises of the borough should sharethe privileges of it.The committee correctly decided this point in disputebetween the parties, by resolving, that such persons only whopaid scot and lot had a right to vote : — but they were misled,by neither party disputing the right of the freemen to includethem, as a separate body, in the right of election; andthereby committed the same error as the Hertford committeehad done before, in continuing this obsolete distinction.The St. Allan's committee were still more mistaken innot imposing upon the freemen the necessity of payingscot and lot; which would in a great degree have neutralizedthe effect of the erroneous conclusion into whichthey were led by the specious admission of the townclerk, who, apparently willing to support the unrestrainedright of the members of the corporation, — said they mightvote without paying. The election was declared void.1701, In 1701, there was a petition of several householders onbehalf of themselves, and other freemen inhabiting withinthe borough, paying scot and lot, complaining, that by thepermission of the mayor, aldermen and town-clerk, severalforeigners were allowed to vote, contrary to the custom ofthe borough.1706, In 1705, there was another petition, upon which the rightwas agreed to be as it had been decided in 1700 — but whohad a right to demand the freedom ; and whether all admitted,were entitled to vote, were the points in question.For the petitioner it was insisted, that all who had servedseven years' apprenticeship to any freemen within the boroughiST. ALBAN's. I97^and the eldest sons of freemen, bora after their fathers were i>om«day.free — had a right to demand admission. That such free Hertford-men,and those made free by redemption on paying 5/.,had alone a right to vote. For the sitting member it wasinsisted, that no person had a right to demand their freedom,but all were made free at the discretion of the corporation,and every person so made free, had a right to vote.The petitioner called many witnesses, who seem to havebeen incompetent to give testimony on the point, — from theirclaiming themselves to vote, in the same right they werecalled to support. However, they stated that they had neverknown any honorary freemen till after King James's charter; but if any tradesman had a mind to settle in the town,and the mayor and aldermen thought it necessary and proper,it was usual to admit him upon paying 51, ; and they producedthe bye-laws to that effect.In answer to this, the charter of Edward VI. was produced ; /also that of Charles II. From both of which it was said itmight be inferred, that the right of freemen was by charter ;and the town-clerk said, that there had been honorary freemenbefore King James's grant ; particularly Dr. Harris ; —but it was owned that he had served in Parliament for thisborough.Upon this evidence it should be observed, that it wasassumed on all sides, that the freemen admitted under KingJames Ii's charter (which, like others of that reign, had probablybeen abandoned), were not entitled to vote. It was amanifest error to suppose that freedom was first given bythe charters ; for we have seen that the right — or ratherqualification to be a burgess — sprung out of the common law.The admission of the parliamentary representative as afreeman (and another instance of the same kind occurs in1717) confirms the suggestion we before made, in consideringthe case of Hertford,* that the non-residents therewere accounted for by the custom of making the membersfreemen.The distinctions respecting eldest sons, and freedom bySee before Hertford.198 ST. ALBAN's.Domesday. redemption, were evidently taken from the bye-laws, to whichHertford we have before referred.The committee resolved, that the right of election was in themayor, aldermen, and such freemen only as have a right tofreedom by birth or service, or having been made free byredemption — and in the householders paying scot and lot.The ill effects of allowing the right to be in the freemanwas verified in this place — as it has been in many others — scythetricks which were so frequently resorted to for the puispose of preventing freemen from being duly made, whenthey were likely to vote contrary to the wishes of the corporation.These courses necessarily led to long and expensivelitigations.The House adopted the resolution of the committee, withan amendment only, as to the right of election, which theylimited to such as were so admitted, '' in order to trade orinhabit within the borough'' Undoubtedly an importantamendment, as tending to restrain the admission of an inordinatenumber of honorary freemen.^^'^' In 1714, the question came again before a committee, —the petitioners insisting upon the right of election originally/ /' established in 1700; but the sitting members disputed theclaim of the honorary freemen. For the petitioners, the chaiter of Edward VI., and the resolution of 1700, were givenin evidence ; and also parol testimony, that for 68 years, ^ / honorary freemen had voted, — ^that being honorary free' * ^ men, or non-president, was no disqualification ; and referencewas made to the ousting of several freemen in the Court ofQueen's BenchFor the sitting member, it was proved, that 50 freemen hadbeen admitted on one occasion — ^which being complained ofto Parliament, it was said the House had set them aside;and they gave in evidence the resolution of 1706; and it wasurged, that all the honorary freemen had been rejected,excepting one, who had served as member for the borough.The committee resolved, that the right was as decidedin 1700, including all the freemen ; and so, in fact — permittingan unrestricted number of honorary freemen to vote.ST. ALBAN's. 199^which gives the means of indirectly out-numbering the Po""'^ y-real burgesses. or inhabitant householders. hertfordshire.It does not appear that the inhabitants were satisfied withthis determination; for in 1722, many of them who paid 1722-scot and lot, petitioned, on behalf of themselves, and the rest , <of the inhabitants of the same description, stating, that theywere assessed for aids granted to his majesty, separatelyfrom the rest of the county of Hertford ; referring to thecharters of Edward VI. and Charles II., and complained,that the mayor and aldermen acted in an arbitrary manner,against the true meaning of those charters, and assumed tothemselves an unlimited power of making what number ofpersons they pleased, freemen of the borough. And theywere so much increased, that some hundred of them beingforeigners, and doing no service to the borough, nor contributingto the aid assessed upon it, yet vote at all electionsof members of Parliament, — and the inhabitants haste almostlost their ancient right, being out-voted by such pretendedfreemen, — which was the cause of great riot and disorderlypractices, and of great bribery, as most notoriously appearedat the last election ; when, although a majority of the inhabitantspaying scot and lot voted for two of the candidates,yet they were out-voted by the freemen.Stronger grounds of complaint — or more decisive proof ofthe effects likely to be produced by the unlimited power ofadmitting honorary freemen, can hardly be supposed. Theactual effect of that power was cogently felt in 1721 and1743 ; at the former of which periods, 120, — and in thelatter, 183 freemen — were admitted for election purposes, tothe scandalous invasion of the rights of the real burgesses.The reader has now seen, as well the municipal as theparliamentary history of this borough, from the time ofWilliam the Conqueror to the present period ; and he willhave observed, that it was a borough, returning membersto Parliament, long before it was incorporated ; — that • 'when the charter of incorporation was granted, in thereign of Edward VI., all the inhabitants — in conformity withthe general law ; and in confirmation, as must be assumed,200 ST. ALBAN'S.- BUCKINGHAM.Domesday, ^f ^jjg aiicicnt usages of the borough — ^were incorporatedHertford as the burgesses of the place. They continued, fromthat time, to act and be recognised as the burgesses, in alltransactions connected with the borough. It should be bornein remembrance — ^that no mention whatever of the freemen ismade in the charter of Edward VI. : nor does that obsoletedistinction occur in any document till the charter of the 8thof Charles L, and in the parliamentary proceedings — longafter the real distinction had ceased to exist. It is the morestriking, that it should have occurred in the parliamentaryproceedings, because the writs and precepts for the electionsare clear and explicit, that the election shall be of burgesses,by the burgesses. Constitutionally and legally speaking, therecan be no possible pretence for allowing the freemen to participatein the parliamentary elections.The municipal history therefore of the borough, is mostdistinct, and free from doubt, — and shows the burgesses tobe the inhabitant householders, paying scot and lot, - Theonly difficulties which have been introduced, are where therights of the burgesses have been wilfully perverted andthrown into doubt, for the purpose of supporting politicaland parliamentary interest ; for which there is the less excuseor pretence, because the parliamentary elections ought clearlyto have been by the " burgesses*BUCKINGHAMSHIRE.BUCKINGHAM.Fol. 143.

Had the word manet been used instead otjaeet,the inference might have been the other way that theperson lived at Riseberge : — but the word " janet " seemspeculiarly applicable to the land held by the tenant, andFol 154. not applying to the tenant himself; and this inference isplaced beyond doubt, by the subsequent entry of Oxford,where the mansion itself is entered, and not the burgess ;^and though there might be a question as to his real residence,there can be none as to the situation of the house,which is described as in Oxford ; therefore that entry, andothers of a similar description in Oxford, are conclusive onthis point, that the burgesses of the different boroughs,who are entered under the several manors, are in fact residentin the boroughs, in houses there held of the manorsunder which they are entered.OXFORD. 203Domesday.OXFORDSHIRE.OXFORD.In Oxfordshire, there were three parliamentary boroughs,besides the University, — oxford, Woodstock, Banbury; —of these, the former alone is mentioned in Domesday. TheUniversity of course, is not spoken of, because it did notexist as a separate jurisdiction, till after the survey.The entry for Oxford precedes the return for the county,and is as follows : —OXFORD.In the time of King Edward, Oxeneford rendered for toll for 154.and gable, and all other customs, by the year, to the king,a certain 20 Z., and six sectaries of honey; and to the EarlAltar 10 Z., the mill being joined which he had within thecity. When the king went on an expedition, 20 burgesseswent with him for all the others ; and they gave 20 Z. to theking, that all might be free.Now Oxeneford renders 60 Z. in tale of 20 in the ore. Inthe town itself, as tee within the wall as without 243 housesrender geld ; and besides these, there are 600 houses, 22 less,so wasted and destroyed, that they cannot render geld.The king hath 20 mural mansions which were of Earl Altarin the time of King Edward ; — he hath one mansion belongingto SciptonSy and another belonging to Blochesham; and a thirdto Siseberge, and two others belonging to Rumford in Buckinghamshire— one of these is waste.* They are called muralmansions because, if need be, and the king command, theyrepair the wall.To the land which Earl Albertus held, belong one churchand three mansions ; — of these, two belong to the church ofSt. Mary.Then follows a list of the manors, and the names ofSee bes. Buckinghamshire, fol. 143, B.204 OXFORD.Domesday. ^.j^^ ecclesiastical and lay proprietors, who are stated to hold^bire** 247 mansions ; of which 102 were waste. Of the foregoing,187 are described as free for the reparation of the walls.Thirteen houses are likewise mentioned, of which two werewaste.The Abbot of St. Edward had one mansion, belongingto Trenton. All the mansions which were called mural, inthe time of King Edward, were free from all custom, exceptexpedition and the repair of the wall. Alain had one housefree for repairing the wall. And if the wall, while there beneed, is, by him who ought to do it, not repaired, he shalleither make amends of 40s, to the king, or lose his house.And all the burgesses of Oxford had, in common, withoutthe wall, pasture rendering 6s. 8d.bi' There is afterwards an entry amongst the king's lands, ofthe customs of the county of Oxford, as follows : —The county of Oxeneford renders the farm of three nights ; —this is 150Z. of increase, 25 Z. weighed; of the borough, 20/.weighed.If any one shall break the king's peace, given with his handand seal, so that he kill a man to whom the same peace shallbe given, his limbs and life shall be in the judgment of theking, if he shall be taken i"^ and if he cannot be taken, heshall be accounted an exile by all ; and if any one shall beable to kill him, he shall have his spoil freely .fAnd' if any stranger shall like to dwell in Oxford, and havinga houses shall die without relations, the king shall have whateverhe shall have left.If any one shall violently break and enter the court or houseof any one, that he may kill or wound and assault a man, lethill make 100«. amends to the kings;Also he who being summoned to go on an expedition,goeth not, shall give 100*. to the kingsIf any man shall slay another between the court and hishouse, his body and all his substance are in the power of theking, except his wife's dower, if she be endowed.So the Saxon Laws.t See also post.

He hath eight waste mansions, and 30acres of meadow near the wall, and a mill of lOs. The wholeis worth 3L, and is holden for one manor with the beneficeof St. Peter.Much of this return corresponds with those which haveoccurred before, and therefore lengthened remarks are notnecessary upon it.It should,however,be observed, that in this instance, as wellas in many that have previously appeared, there are housesand lands belonging to the borough, as well within the wallsas without ; and the many houses belonging to other manors,which are entered in this place, are again decisive to show,that the burgesses in other manors, were entered, in respectof the tenure of their houses ; though they were burgesses ofthe borough, in respect of their residence and occupation.The customs of the county of Oxford, have been inserted,with a view of showing their immediate connection with theSaxon laws; and the provision for a stranger coming todwell in Oxford, and having a house there, will be foundconfirmatory of the obligation, to which we have beforealluded, of every new-comer who was a householder, beingentitled and bound to take upon himself, all the liberties andburdens of the place. And we have another proof, that otherswho were suffering under poverty, were excused from all theburdens, both of the state and borough : it being a reasonableand necessary consequence, that they were excludedfrom all privileges,— of which the still existing general disqualificationby receipt of alms, is the modem confirmation.206 TEWKESBURY.Donmdaj'.GLOUCESTERSHIRE,6LOUCB8TSB, Tewkesbury.In Gloucestershire, there were three parliamentary boroughs— Gloucester, Cirencester, and Tewkesbury; — of these,two only are referred to as boroughs in Domesday, namely,Gloucester and Tewkesbury.TEWKESBURY.FoLi63,B. This place occurs only once, where it is described ashaving 13 burgesses and a marketGLOUCESTER.Fol. 162. Of Gloucester there is a considerable entry, and frequentmention of the burgesses in several manors. It appearsthat it was a city in the time of King Edward ; and providedcertain supplies for the king's ships, his hall, and chamber.The other parts of the entry resemble many that haveoccurred before, and contain an enumeration of the owners,ecclesiastical as well as lay, of three houses and 20mansions. Ten houses are stated to be wanting where thecastle is ; 14 are described as waste.One other house is also entered, in another manor ; and62 burgesses in Gloucester are 'mentioned under differentmanors — besides the burgesses of St. Peter — the number ofwhom is not stated.In this entry there appears nothing material for observation;— but it may be somewhat further illustrated by a documentto which the learned research of Sir Henry Ellis* hasdrawn our attention. It is an extract from the CottonianRegister of Evesham Abbey, containing returns, which areprobably originals, made by the commissioners who formedthe Domesday survey.Sir HeD. Ellis, Domesday » ii. 445, n.3. Cost. Reg. Evesham Abbey. Vespas.B.24. fol. 53 and 55.GLOUCESTER. 207It appears from them, that there were 612 burgesses, ^™^*^y-though in Domesday itself, only 62 are mentioned: — ®^®h^*""i^liich confines the observation we have before made, thatmust not look into this survey for ample statementsto the burgesses, nor be disappointed if we do not findt.liein ; — neither assume that there were none, because noneape mentioned — for this document was compiled, not for thepurpose of giving an account of the burgesses, but of theIcing's revenue.The material part of the extract is as follows :In the time of King Edward, there were, in the city ofGloucester, 300 burgesses, in demesne, rendering 18Z. and 10s.of gable annually. From these there are 100, three less,resident an their own hereditary property ; and 100, three less,dwelling in purchased mansions, of French and English,which are worth lOZ. per annum ; and they hold them for12 years. Within the castle, there remain of these 300, 24;and 82 mansions are waste.After which follows an enumeration of the persons ecclesiasticaland lay, having a number of burgesses, who mustbe persons residing in houses held of these individuals,amounting altogether to 312. And upon all these the kinghath sac and soc ; and 10 churches are properly in the king'sThis document affords us a fact which the survey does notexpressly communicate; — that many of the burgesses residedin the houses they possessed : — amounting altogetherto 194. The 312 other burgesses appear to have livedin houses rented of several lords. In this extract, therefore,we have a most distinct refutation of the doctrine,that burgess-ship depended upon ancient demesne or tenure:for we have here persons holding in every differentway — some of the king, though hereditary property —some of him, though purchased property — and somemerely rented of other lords — and yet they are all burgesses.And as the only point in which they are similarly circumstancedis — that they are all inhabitant householders,208 WORCESTER.Domesday, resident within the borough — it seems impossible toGiooeester- doubt, that circumstance was the ground of their being burgesses.Before we quit this extract, we ought however to observe,that, contrary to the doctrine which we have before maintained,— ^thatthe castles were generally separate from the boroughs,— ^we find it is here stated, that 24 of the king's burgessesdwelt within the castle. If this were the fact, it was anexception to the rule for which we have before contended ;but it is worthy of note, that this circumstance is not advertedto in the survey ; on the contrary, it is there stated, that10 houses are now wanting where the castle is," which seemsrather to raise the inference, that the castle was not withinthe borough.WORCESTERSHIRE.WORCESTER, DROITWICH.In Worcestershire there were foiir parliamentary boroughsFoL 172. — Worcester, Evesham, Bewdley, Droitwich — of which onlyWorcester, and Droitwich, under the name of Wich, arementioned as boroughs.The survey of this county affords but little informationupon the subject of our present inquiry.WORCESTER.The separate entry of the city of Worcester, like manyother cities and boroughs, precedes that of the county : butthere is no mention of thebui^esses in it, nor does any thingillustrative of their situation appear.The geld of the county, and the census of the houses arementioned. The entry then proceeds, — which probably mustbe referred to the county at large, and not to the city alone,the king holds it in demesne, part his own, and partbelonging to the earl.•VWORCESTER. 209The profits of the pleas of the county and of the hundreds P<"°g»^y'are returned, ' ^sS"?''There are 12 hundreds mentioned in the county; sevenare so free that the sheriff has nothing in them, and thereforehe says, he loses much in his firm. From which itappears — that the freedom was from the payment of the ,Jimmy to which the counties at lai^e, as well as the boroughs, Vwere subject; and yet charters, granting boroughs at fee Qfafm^^ave been considered as charters of incorporation But >alttioiigE these seven hundreds enjoyed this exemption, it canscarcely be contended, that they were incorporated.Forfeitures for several offences in the county, particularlybreach of the peace, — ^in conformity with the Saxon Laws, —are mentioned; as well as penalties for not following theking to the war.Although Worcester is not in this part of the surveyspleen of as a borough, nor are any of its burgesses mentioned,in a subsequent folio it is expressly described as aFoLi73,B.borough, amongst the lands of the Bishop of Worcester. Butto stark the imperfection and irregularity of the returns onthese points, Wich* is mentioned in the same place, but notas a borough, although its burgesses are subsequently named.Thus, the church of St. Dionysius is stated as holding one Fol.l74.hide in Wich ; and there are there (that is in Wich) 18 burgesses.The church of Coventry has also a hide in Wich,which Urso holds, and has four burgesses. Amongst thelands of the church of St. Peter, Westminster, in Wich,31 burgesses, rendering 15^. 8ef. are returned. And in anon FoI.l76.ther part, nine burgesses belonging to St. Guthlac; and Roger foL i76,b.de Lace had one hide in Wich, where were eleven burgesses.Osbom, the son of Richard, had 13 burgesses in Wich, whoserved at his court : — marking the difference between suchservice at a court baron, which they owed to the manor inrespect of their tenure ; and suit royal, which they owed inthe borough, at the court leet, in respect of their resiancy ; —by virtue of which they were burgesses.■• Wich, now Droitwich.VOL.

As to Worcester, although many houses occur — 26 in oneplace — ^28 in another — 90 in another — and two or three otherhouses in different entries, as well as some manses — stillthere are, as compared with Wich, very few burgesses men-fol.176, tioned. Ralph de Toderi has two; William, the son ofCorbucion, one ; Arson de Abetot, one ; and Hugo Lanestwo : making altogether, only six burgesses for this city ; —a circumstance certainly worthy of remark ; but probably tobe accounted for, either in the manner we have suggestedas to Gloucester ; or by the destruction of the city by Hardicanute,in 1039, about 40 years before, when the inhabitantsfled, and their possessions having probably been seizedby him, were not at the time of the survey, in the handsof persons who, as freemen, could be burgesses.Pol. 173, B. Urso is stated to hold of the bishop, 25 houses in the market: but no burgesses are mentioned.There are in this county, as inothers,manyplacesdescribedas having sac and soc, though not boroughs. liberi homines''frequently occur; and also that class of tenants who couldtransfer themselves and their lands whither they liked ; whichis conclusive, that tenure and residence were not necessarilyconnected. The firm and geld of lands and places not withinthe borough, are also often described. The castle of Dudleyis spoken of, but it does not appear to be a borough ; anotherinstance to negative the assertion of Brady, — ^that boroughshad their origin in castles.The peculiarities in the survey of this county, are — first, thequantity of land which is returned free from geld : — secondly,that in Wich, half a hide is said to belong to the hall atGloucester: — thirdly, a manor is stated to be held for threelives : — fourthly, a parol will is mentioned : — ^and finom oneentry it appears, that the shire courts were held before thebishop, and the other barons of the king.BEWDLEY.-EVSSHAM. 211Domesday.Sedley.— EVESHAM. Worcester.dire.Bewdley is not mentioned in this return. Evesham washeld freely by the church of Evesham : — it is not calleda borough; and the residents there are described by theterm '' manentiwaC^ — not as burgesses.The only material part of the entry as to that place, is asfollows : —In Evesham, where the abbey is situated, there are, and folhs^b.always were, three hides of free land. Some are in demesne,and the bordarii do service to the abbey court. A mill, andthe cense of the man there residing, is stated to be 20«.That neither the borough nor burgesses are spoken of, isreadily explained, considering that the place was the possessionof the church; — tenants of ancient ecclesiasticalproperty not being subject to the temporal, but to the ecclesiasticallaw; the bordarii, therefore, who are here mentionedas owing service to the abbey, would not owe suit tothe sheriff's court or tom, and consequently had no reasonto seek an exemption from his jurisdiction, by obtaining,like other places, the grant of being a free borough ; thereis, therefore, every reason for inferring, — that Evesham wasnot at that time a borough.As confirmatory of the exemption of ecclesiastical propertyfrom the jurisdiction of the sheriff, we shall note a passage inthe entry of the land belonging to the church at Worcester: — pol m. b.which states, that the church of Saint Mary had one hundred,called Oswaldeslav ; in which there lie 300 hides, of whichthe bishop of that church,* from the constitution of ancienttimes, has the profits of all pleas and customs belonging tothe demesne, and the table and service of the king, and hisown ; so that no sheriff can hold there any plaint y neither inany plea, nor in any cause whatever.Other particulars are subjoined, but the above will sufficeto establish the point we have suggested.p2212 HEREFORD.Domesday.HEREFORDSHIRE.HEREFORD.There were in Herefordshire, three parliamentary boroughsHereford, — Leinster, — ^and Wesley. The first is theonly one mentioned in Domesday as a borough ; and of that,the entry, like many of the considerable cities and boroughs,precedes the return of the county. As it specifies the customsof the city with much particularity, it is desirable toinsert it.HEREFORD.Fol. 179. In the city of Hereford, in the time of King Edward, therewere 103 men dwelling together, within and without thewall; and they had these under-written customs: — If anyoneof them wished to depart from the city, he was able, bygrant of the reeve, to sell his house to another man willing todothe due service thereof; and the reeve had the third pennyof this sale. If any by his poverty was not able to do service,he relinquished without price his house to the reeve, whoprovided, that the house should not remain empty, and thatthe king should not want his service. Within the wall ofthe city, every entire madura rendered 7 Jd. and 4d. for thehire of horses ; and four days in August, he mowed atMarine ; and one day to collect the hay when the sheriffwilled. He who had a horse, went three times in the yearwith the sheriff, to the Pleas and Hundred Courts at UreWhen the king appointed to go to hunt, one manfrom every house wentbycustom to the standing the wood.Other men not having entire masuree, found attendants forthe king at the hall, when the king was in the city.A burgess serving with a horse, when he died, the king hadhis horse and arms.

These customs ^^Sre"*bad the inhabitants in the city, and others likewise dwellingwithout the wall ; except only that an entire madura withoutthe wall, gave only 3Jrf. Other customs were common. —Whatever man's wife brewed within and without the city,gave lors. by custom. Six smiths were in the city, eachrendering Id. for his forge, and making 120 nails of theking's iron ; and 3d. were given to each of them by custom ;and these smiths were quit from all other custom. Therewere seven moneyers ; — one of these was the moneyer ofthe bishop: — when money was renewed, each gave I8s,for receiving the coinage die; and from that day, whenthey rendered them for one month, each gave to the king,20s.; and likewise the bishop had of his moneyer, 20s.When the king came into the city, as much money as hewilled, the moneyers made for him, to wit, of the king's silver;and these seven had their sac and soc* When any moneyer ofthe king died, the king had 20s. for relief; but if he diedwithout devising his effects, the king had them all. If thesheriff should go into Wales with an army, these men wentwith him. If any one who was ordered to go, went not, hemade amends of 40^. to the king. In this city, Harl Haroldhad 27 burgesses, having the same customs as other burgesses.Of this city, the reeve rendered 121. to King Edward, and 61.to Earl Harold ; and he had in his cense all the aforesaidcustoms. But the king had in his demesne three forfeitures,that is, — breach of peace, — hinefare, — and forestallingWhoever did one of these, made 100^. amends to the king,whosesoever man he was.Now the king hath the city of Hereford in demesne ; andthe English burgesses dwelling there, have their own customs ;but the French burgesses have all their forfeitures quit forI2d.y except the three aforesaid. This city rendered to theking, 601. in tale of white money.

Considering also themethod which is described, of a person's quitting the city andselling his house, with the consent of the king's officer — thereeve, — provided he could procure another person to do thedue service of his house; it is obvious, — ^that if burgess-shipin any borough depended upon tenure, it would be in this,where the possession of the house and the services, wereso directly connected. Yet there is no trace of any burgageright having existed in this place ; but all the municipal andparliamentary privileges appear to have been exercised by thefreemen ; and it returned members from the earliest times.The disqualification by poverty also occurs in this case.The king being entitled to the horse and arms of a personwho died, — there applied to a burgess, — will probablysatisfy the reader, that the passage occurring before in theentry of Oxford, was also intended to be applied in thesame manner.In this entry the inhabitants of the city are expresslyspoken of; it being the first, and it is believed, the onlytime the term occurs in the survey.The Saxon laws are also obviously referred to in thisreturn. The distinction between the French and Englishburgesses appears strongly to prove, — ^that all persons dwellingwithin the borough, whether natives or strangers, were,under certain conditions, entitled to be burgesses.The farms of other manors, as well as that of the city,are mentioned: — which is decisive to establish, that theholding at fee farm was not the peculiar characteristic of aborough : — ^nor was it an indication of a corporation.In the entry of the manor of Merchelai, four burgesses aiHereford, are stated to render to that manor eighteen ploughshares; distinctly confirming, by the new feature of renderingrent to the manor, the fact we have so often insistedupon, of the burgesses, though resident in the borough,holding of distant manors.GRENT£BR10£. 215Domoidajr.CAMBRIDGESHIRE.Cambridge TOWN.There is in Cambridgeshire only the Borough of Cambridge,and the University, which of course is not mentionedin the survey, as its separate jurisdiction was of subsequentcreation. The entry of Cambridge precedes that of thecounty. The only material parts of it are as follow : —GRENTEBRIGE.The Borough of Orentebrige defended itself for an hun Fol. 189.dred in the time of King Edward.In this borough were and are 10 wards.In the first ward are 64 masuree ; of these two are waste.In this ward Earl Alan hath five burgesses rendering nothing.Earl Morton, of the land of Judicial, hath three masuree,and there are three burgesses. Roger, the man of theBishop of Remigius, three burgesses. Exchange hath oneburgess. This same ward was accounted for two in the timeof King Edward ; but 27 houses are destroyed for the castle.In the second ward were 48 masurs in the time of KingEdward; of these two are waste. Of these measure Earl Alanhath 6 burgesses.In the third ward, in the time of King Edward, there were41 measure; of these 11 were waste.In the fourth ward, in the time of King Edward, therewere 46 measure; of these 24 are waste.In the fifth ward, in the time of King Edward, there were50 masuree; one of these is waste.(The sixth wai'd seems to be omitted.)And in the seventh, in the time of King Edward, therewere 37 measure.In the eighth ward, in the time of King Edward, there were37 masurcB.In the nth, in the time of King Edward, there were 32measure; of these three are waste.216 HUNTINGDON.^""^y- In the tenth, in the time of King Edward, there were 29^*^^ naturae ; of these there are six waste.Of the customs of this town 71, by the year; and of Liable7LThe burgesses in the time of King Edward lent theirploughs to the sheriff three days in the year: now they arerequired nine times. They found neither cattle nor ploughsin the time of King Edward, which now they do by customimposed. But they reclaim from Picot, the sheriff, commonof pasture, taken away by him from them.From this entry it appears that Cambridge, like manyancient towns, was divided into wards ; and the residencesseem to be described by the term measure, with which theburgesses are expressly connected: — ^because 48 measuresare mentioned in the second ward; and it is added, of theseEarl Alan hath five burgesses.HUNTINGDONSHIRE.HUNTINGDON.In this county there was, at the time of the survey, onlyone Borough, namely, Huntingdon ; which is at present alsothe only place returning members in Huntingdonshire.FoU203. The entry as to this borough mentions 116 burgesses intwo feelings, who pay all customs and the king's geld ; andthere are under them 100 bordarii, who help them in payingthe geld. Many of these burgesses are stated to belong todifferent lords, by reason of their tenures in other places : —their burgess-ship depending on their residence. Some ofthem belonged to lords who had sac and soc* But it isclear, from the contents of the survey, that those privilegesalone did not make a borough, because there aremany places in this county, as in Herefordshire, wherethey existed, which, nevertheless, were not boroughs.There are some mansions entered without any notice ofSoc and sac j~ see before, Hereford, p. 213.HUNTINGDON. 217the burgesses : — many were destroyed when the castle ^^'"'^'^y-was built, and others were waste: of course there could be Huntingburgesses in respect of them. But that burgesses hadtheir privileges on account of their residence, and theirhouses, is directly shown by a subsequent part of this entry,which speaks of 22 burgesses with their houses, as belongingto the church.It appears that the borough was held at firm: — ^whichfact, however, did not give it that character, because,numerous places will be instanced as held at fern that werenot boroughs; and on the other hand, boroughs may be foundwhich were not held at fee-farm.The same observation may be made as to the geld ; — ^inthe entry said to be paid to the king; — but other landshave been before mentioned, and there were many in thiscounty held at geld, although they were not situated inany borough.It appears from two or three passages in the survey ofHuntingdonshire, that the return for the county was madeby the men of the hundred ; but that for the borough ofHuntingdon, (as might be expected, if the suggestion thatthe boroughs had a jurisdiction separate from the hundredsof the county, and exempt from the power of thesheriff, is accurate) by the men of that place; as it isexpressly stated, the men who swore in Huntingdon, hominesqui juraverunt in Huntedune,) say, that the church of St.Mary of the borough belonged to the church of Tony.Afterwards the men of the county (homines de comitatu)testify as to some lands not in the borough. The samedistinction seems to be marked as to the payment of thegeld: — that of the borough being entered as described before,in the return for the borough; and in another part, thelands respecting which the men of the county testify, arestated to geld in the hundred.As a matter of curiosity rather than of importance, it maybeobserved, that this entry closes with a distinction takenby those who made the return, between the facts which theyknew of their own knowledge, — and what they had only21 g BEDFORD.P^'p^'^y' heard — ^** Hoc dixenmt se audible, sed non vidisse; chequeunatiiig- << interesse" — an earlier exclusion of hearsay evidence thanis perhaps generally known to exist.BEDFORDSHIRE.BBBFOBD.In this county there is only one borough — ^viz. Bedford : —which is not described as such, but is entered separatelybefore the king's lands : frequent mention is made of theburgesses ; and their lands are specially specified.The entry is as follows :BEDFORD.Fol. 209. In the time of King Edward, it defended itself for half ahundred, — and now it does so, for land expeditions and inships. The land in this town was never hided, — ^nor is itBOW : — except one hide, which belonged to the church of St.Paul, in alms, in the time of King Edward ; an now itrightly belongs ; but Remigius, the bishop, took it out of thealms of the church of St. Paul — unjustly, as the men say —and now holds it, and whatever belongs to it.After the Terra Regis and the lands of other persons, theseth entry contains the lands of the burgesses of Bedford,amongst which occur the following : —Fol. 218. In the same will, (Bingham,) Godwin, a burgess of theking, holds one hide. Haifa hide of this land, he who nowholds it, held in the time of King Edward, which he wasable to give to whom he willed — but half a hide, and thefourth part of one yardland, he bought after King Williamcame into England ; he hath done service therefore, neitherto the king nor to any one, nor hath he had livery of it.William Speck reclaims, against the same man, one yard-land,and the fourth part of (me yardland, which was deliveredto him, and afterwards he lost it.In the same will, Ordui, a burgess of the king, holds oneBEDFORD.— NORTHAMPTON. 219hide, and three parts of half a hide, &c. Half a hide, and '^^"^y-the fourth part of one yardland of this land, the same who Bedford-nowholds, held in the time of Kii^ Edward, and teas ableto give it to whom he pleased-shut he held one yardland inpledge in the time of King Edward, and still holds it, as themen of this hundred testify. The same bought one yard-land,and the fourth part of one yardland, after King Williamcame into England — ^and renders service neither to theking nor to any one.In the same will, Ulmarus, a burgess of the hing, holdstwo parts of one yardliCnd, &c. ; he held it in the time ofKing Edward, and could give it to whom he pleased.These entries relative to Bedford, — like those of Hereford, —would seem to support the doctrines of burgess-ship, dependingupon ancient demesne, or burgage tenure, more thanany which have before occurred : — ^yet there are no traces ofany burgage tenure rights having been exercised in theborough — but, on the contrary, the municipal and parliamentaryprivileges have always been exercised by the freemen,and their right hafkbeen confirmed by committees ofthe House of Commons; — notwithstanding Bedford hasreturned members from the earliest period.NORTHAMPTONSHIRE and LEICESTERSHIRE.NORTHAMPTON AND Leicester.In the county of Northampton one place only is enteredas a borough.Peterborough is described as a will, amongst the possessionsof the Abbot of St. Peter, Ind is stated to be called'burg" — ^no further reference is made to it as a borough;nor to its burgesses.NORTHAMPTON.Of Northampton there is a long entry, stating, that in the220 NORTHAMPTON.Pomctd>y. ti^^ ^f meg Edward, in the demesne of the king, thereNoi^«^p. were 60 burgesses^ hang so many mansions,Leicester ^^' *^*^ ^^ ^^^ c^ise, we have the burgesses expressly"^?; " connected with their mansions.Fol. 219.Fourteen are said to be waste, leaving a residue of 46 :and in the new borough, 40 burgesses, in the demesne ofKing William — and it may be fairly assumed, that they,like the others, had their mansions.From these entries we may justly infer, that the burgessesof Northampton were anciently householders.Besides these, there are stated to be 230 houses, theowners of which, ecclesiastical as well as lay, are enumerated; 23 of them are described as waste. Of nine out of37 of them, which Earl Morton had, the king hath the soc;and Baldwin has half a mansion waste.No burgesses are mentioned, with respect to any of thesehouses ; we may therefore infer, that they either were in theoccupation of aliens — religious persons — females — or personswho, on account of their poverty, were not able to contributeto the charges of the borough, and therefore — were notentitled to the benefits of it.The burgesses are stated to pay their farm to the sheriff:—a circumstance confirmatory of a point to which we shall hereafterhave occasion to draw attention — viz. that although theboroughs were, for some purposes, (particularly with respectto their service at the tom,) exempted from the jurisdictionof the sheriff, they were not altogether free from his interference; especially as to the fee-farm — frequent instances ofwhich, we shall hereafter find in the pipe rolls of KingStephen.This is all which is material in the return of Northampton,or of the county. As however this entry so distinctly establishes,that the burgesses of Northampton were householders; it may be useful here to trace the history of thisplace through its further stages : — and as it is, at least uponone occasion, connected with the history of Leicester, it maybedesirable to insert the entry of that place from Domesday,and consider the history of the two together.LEICESTER. 221Domesday.LEICESTER. NorthamptonshireThe return for Leicester, like Northampton, is separate Leicnter-from the county, and precedes the Terra Regis.Leicester in the commencement is described as a city — forwhich there appears to be no warrant, there being no traceof its having had a bishop, or being particularly under ecclesiasticaljurisdiction. — Unless indeed it derived that title Fol. 230.from the abbey ;— or unless the reference to a place calledthe Bishop's Fee,* in the charter of the 41st of Queen Elizabeth,may serve to explain the use of this term. However,in a subsequent passage of the same entry, it is called aborough.The rent, in the time of King Edward, is mentioned. * Andwhen the king went out with his army by land, 12 burgessesof the borough went with him — but if he went against theenemy by sea, they sent to him four horses from the sameborough, as far as London, to carry arms, or other things ofwhich there was need.The rent which King William had of the city and county,is also referred to— being another instance of the union ofthe two, as far as related to the fee-farm rent.The houses of the king — of the archbishop, (who had two,with soc and sac,) — as well as those of many of the proprietors,ecclesiastical and lay — amounting to 71, are enumerated;of all which the king is said to have the geld. Besidesthese, Hugh de Orentemaisnial is stated to have 110 houses,and 24 others in common with the king, in the same borough.These excepted, the same Hugh hath in Leicester, 24 burgessesbelonging to Hanstigie ; and 13 burgesses belongingto Siglesbie; and 63 houses belonging to different manors;besides five other houses, with soc and sac. Robert de Veiihath nine houses, with soc and sac. Many other houses inthe borough of Leicester are also mentioned as held ofdifferent manors — ^from which no question can arise thatsuch was the course of tenure at that time : — but that it didnot interfere with business-ship. This is further confirmed byPat. 41 Eliz. p. 1 .222 NORTHAMPTON AND LEICESTER.P*™****^* entries of burgesses in the city as appertaining to other^t^Sw' ™^^o™ : — ^and lands without the borough are i converse statedhJ^^ to belong to the borough.Fol.231, In pursuing the histories of these places which are sufficientlyidentified, in the earliest periods, by the entries inloo. Domesday, we meet upon the charter roll, in the first yearof King John, with a charter to the burgesses of Ncrthr-ampUniy* granting that none of them should plead out oftheir walls — ^that they should not be adjudged of amercementsof money, but as the citizens of London in the time ofEdward L — ^with freedom from murder— duel — meskining —toll — scotale — custom, &c. That no persons should takeany lodging there by force : — ^with other privileges, usual inthe charters of that time ; and granting all the liberties andfree customs which the citizens of London had. The fee-farmwas fixed at 1252.; and there was a special provision, thatthe burgesses might yearly make whom they thought fit, ofthemselves, and who might be proper for them and the king,to be " reeve," in the following manner : — the burgesses, bythe common council of the town, to elect two of the lawfuland most discreet of the town, and present them to thesheriff of Northamptonshire, that the sheriff might presentone of them as reeve to the chief justices at Westminster,where he ought to render his account : which reeve shouldwell and faithfully keep the bailiwick (preposition) of thetown of Northampton — ^and that he should not be removedas long as he conducted himself well in his bailiwick, exceptby the common council of the town. Also, that in the sameborough, hy the common council of the tovnty should be elected'four of the lawful and more discreet men of the borough,to keep the pleas and other things which belong to thecrown; and to see that the reeve should justly and lawfullydeal with the poor, as well as the rich.Foi. 104, B. '^ ^^^ same year, there is a charter to Robert, Earl ofLeicester f by the same kings which granted exemption fromRot Car., p. 2. f Harl. MS. 84.NORTHAMPTON AND LEICESTER. 223suits of shires and hundreds, and aid to the sheriff, whether ^^""'^'^y*taken by hides of lands or ploughs, (the mode of calculation ^gj^gf"prevalent throughout the whole of the Domesday survey,) j^i^ter-and of money given for murder or theft, and pence belonging *^^^to free-pledge, (that is, the assign pennies, paid to excusethe attendance at the tom or leet,) with the usual grantof them — ^infangthef — sac and goc*— and quittance of pontage— passage — ^toU, &c.This charter is in perfect unison with the Saxon Laws,and the usages and customs apparent in Domesday. Fromits context, it could clearly not have been intended to ^apply to the earl individually ; but for the benefit of hismen and tenants, including (amongst others) the burgessesof Leicester.It appears that the burgesses obtained a further grantfrom the crown, in the same year, of important privil^es,probably for the purpose of securing themselves from anyclaim by the earl; as the charter provided, that all purchasesand sales of their lands in the town of Leicester, made in thepoTt-man mote, should be valid ; — ^that being the fol-mote ormeeting of the men of the town, which, in the Saxon, is called« Part:'A charter was also granted upon the same day to theburgesses, that they might freely traffick throughout theking's dominions with all their merchandises.These charters only detail and confirm the privilegeswhich the burgesses of both these places had before enjoyed; but at the commencement of each reign, the kingusually received a fine for the recognition of their formerprivil^es, and it gradually became, a practice, in every succeedingreign, to detail them, with increased particularity:for, as the sheriff was wont to insist upon all his rights andjurisdiction not expressly excluded by the words of thecharter; — so also the burgesses from time to time procuredprovisions to be inserted in the grant to them excludinghis claims. Hence from the very brief charters of the reignof Henry II., the subsequent grants increased to the enormouslength of those of the Tutors and Stuart; some224 NORTHAMPTON AND LEICESTER.Domesday. gffgc^^ally excluding the Sheriff, by making the places*to^hS?' counties of themselves.anilLeicester In Northampton it appears that there had not been anyreeve, before the charter granted by King John: — ^whichexplains the passage in Domesday, stating that the fee-farmof the borough was paid to the sheriff of the county : — andtherefore the charter to that place provides for the electionof a reeve — ^and four persons to keep the pleas of the crown.Both of these elections are directed to be made by ^' commoncouncil" of the town. These words might be supposed tobe used in the sense in which they are ordinarily taken inmodem times, viz. to describe the body who form the commoncouncil of a corporation. But in truth, they are hereused to express the common consent of the town: — an applicationof the term occurring in the Saxon laws,* and inmany documents of this and the immediately succeedingperiods; long before the bodies of common councilmenwere in general use. We shall find a common councilcreated in Northampton 200 years subsequent to thistime.Henry III., in the 11th year of his reign, granted to the1227. burgesses of Northampton a charter, confirming by inspeximusthat of King John.With respect to Leicester, we find, in the 17 th of Henry1233. ni., two persons presiding over that town as aldermen : —being the first who occur in the books of the boroughin that capacity. They seem to have continued for severalyears.This appellation, as we have before observed in consideringthe Saxon Laws, is often mistakingly supposed to bedescriptive of a corporate officer. The alderman or elder-manhowever is one of the earliest Saxon officers known inthis country. — His office of government, and for the preservationof the peace, was of old, like the constable, veryextensive: — ^they both usually presiding over considerabledistricts — as wards of cities, — ^in London and other ancientplaces. And at Calne, in Wiltshire, there is still an officer,♦ Vide LI. Will.LEICESTER. 226not belonging to the corporation, but nominated at the Do^cs^^^y -court leet, who acts as constable, and is called '^ alder NOT^waap">> andman. Leicester*Simon de Mountford, Earl of Leicester, in this reign gave *,^a confirmation charter to the burgesses :— reciting, that^^®"*^"*Robert, some time Earl of Leicester (the individual to whomthe former grant was given), had enfeoffed, by his charterto the burgesses of Leicester, a certain pasture calledCowley, in the South Fields of Leicester. And thereuponSimon de Mountford, then Earl of Leicester, newly revised,released, and entirely from him and his heirs, for ever quittedclaim to all right which he had to the said pasture, to thefree burgesses of Leicester.This is a grant of a piece of pasture as a common forthe cows of the burgesses or inhabitants, who at that timecould even hold and enjoy lands as an aggregate body, thoughnot incorporated, as is admitted by Lord Coke, &c. and isabundantly proved by Mr. Madox, in his Firma Burgh ; norwas it doubted till Outward's case, temp. Eliz.* introduceda new principle, denying the right of inhabitants to prescribefor right of common, except in respect of an ancient tenement,or as members of a corporation.In the same reign there was another grant of liberties to ^^'the mayor and burgesses of Leicester, reciting,—- that neither 53 HeiuiUrtheir persons nor goods, in any place of the king's dominions,should be arrested for any debt whereof they were not suretiesor principal debtors, unless the debtors were of theircommunity f and under their power, having wherewith tosatisfy the debts in whole or in part, unless it should bereasonably made to appear, that the mayor and burgesseswere deficient in doing justice to their creditors.The term * ^ community* ' we have before commented upon,and should not again refer to it, but for the generalnotion, suggested originally by Brady, that this term hasacorporate meaning, — to which every early document isdirectly opposed.Co. vi. ^ a. & Cro.

Richard IL in the 2d year of his reign, confirmed thecharter of King John to the burgesses of Leicester as totheir sales in the port^man-^mote.1384. The same king granted also to Northampton a confirmationof the charter of Henry II L13P9. And in the 22d, granted to Thomas Hornby, of Leicester,the custody of the court called " The Prince's Court" —this was probably the court leet, — as a document in thereign of Edward IV. speaks of the exclusive jurisdiction ofthe borough, to which the persons commorant and abidingthere — ^that is the resiants, the suitors at the court leet — ^wereliable.1446. In this year, from the return for Northampton, it appearsthat the mayor and bailiffs elected the members to Parliament,edith the ^^ common assent of the town" — words which seem tobe tantamount to those we have before commented upon"per commune concilium village."1464, In the 4th of Edward IV. that king granted to LeicesterLEICESTER. 227that it should have, like Northampton, four justices for the Po'^^'^y-borough. The charter is as follows : 'toJ^SSTFor the greater security and quiet of the mayor and bur LeiJJier-gesses of the town or borough of Leicester, it is granted to thethen mayorandbui^esses, and to their successors, for ever:*That the mayor for the time being, and sow of the dishgreatest comburgessesj with one person skilled in the laws, to'^ be called the recorder, should hejiLsticeSy to keep and cause** to be kept the statutes of servants, artificers and labourers.*^ That the mayor and comburgesses, or any three or two ofthem, with the recorder, should have power to hear and'' determine all manner of transgressions, misprisions, extorttions, and all other causes, complaints, and misdemeanors*^ within the town or borough, as fully as the justices inthe county of Leicester, clipping of coin, &c. onlyexcepted.'^ That no justice of the peace of the county, or other justiceor commissioner of the king, or his heirs, should intermeddlein any matter (except as before excepted).That neither they, the mayor and burgesses, nor theirsuccessors, nor any constable of the town or borough ofLeicester, nor any other person there commorant, should bebound to appear before any other justice of the peace, orany other justice or commissioner of the king, or his heirs,** either within or without the said town, to inquire or do anythingin the matters aforesaid happening in the town orliberties (except as before excepted), save only before themayor, and four of the discreet comburgesses, and their** successors.** That if any mayor, burgess, constable, or other personwithin the town or burgh abiding ^ should be summoned orimpannelled, and refuse to appear before any other justiceabout any such matter, or to swear or inquire about any heads*' or articles thereunto belonging, that for such his refusal heshould not be put in contempt, or incur any loss or penalty^' to the king or his heirs."That the mayor, and the 24 comburgesses (probably the♦ Pat. Roll. p. 1. m. 12.q2uit«nifituaifififit228 LEICESTER.Domesday, gnuid jury), should yearly, upon the feast of St. Matter,Northamp- elect four of the said 24 to be justices of the peace for theLei^ler- 7^^^ ensuing, and two of the said 24 to be coroners, and no■^'** other coroner to intermeddle.That they the mayor, burgesses and their successors,should not be impannelled on any assizes, juries, jurisdictionsor recognizances though they concern either the kingor his heirs, or other of his liege people — to be som orput upon the trial of any arraignment or assize, before anyjustice or commissioners of the king or his heirs, about anycause or matters happening without the town or borough.1473. The same king, in another charter reciting, — that fromthe affection and love which he had to the torn of Leicester,and also to his beloved and faithful the mayor and burgessesthere commorant, granted to them a fair for theirbenefit.1485. From the books of the borough, it appears,* that at acommon hall, by the power of the king's writ, directedto the mayor and his brethren, and the commonalty, forthe election of burgesses to parliament, there is chosen bythe mayors brethren to be bui^ess, John Roberts ; and bythe commonalty there is chosen, Peres Curtis.This appears to be an irregular and illegal election, notwithstandingall parties acquiesced in it. The members, by thewrit and the law and usage of Parliament, were to be electedby the burgesses ; the mayor and burgesses therefore couldnot make any arrangement amongst themselves for alteringtheir legal course of election ; consequently this divided useof the franchise, partly by the mayor and brethren, and partlyby the commonalty, could not be legal : — both these bodiescould not represent the burgesses— one must be wrong — thebrethren were, in all probability, the jury — the commonalty,the body at large : — ^and there can be no doubt but that theywere the burgesses, and were entitled to elect both themembers.Another entry states an ordinance, by the whole assentand agreement, as well of the mayor and all his brethren,• Vide Nicholls's History of Leicester.LEICESTER. 229co^burgesses of the town, as by the commonalty, that the Do»«»d»y.to^¥n should be divided intotwelyetDords, and in every ward, NoHhamp-one of the mayor's brethren, for the time being, dwelling ^e^^^,within the same ward, or next thereunto, was to be called an ■^*^*alderman ; to have full power and authority to correct andpunish all such people, at any time trespassing, after thequantity of his trespass; and if any such person would notobey the correction and punishment of the alderman, thatthen the alderman should show his name unto the mayor,who according to justice was to correct and punish the trespasser,until he should submit himself unto his alderman. Andat every time it should happen any such alderman to decease,or to be mayor, that then at the next common hallto be holden after his decease, one other of the mayor'sbrethren to be chosen an alderman, and to have the powerand correction, &c.This division of Leicester into wards, under separate aldermen,seems to have been made in conformity with the precedentof London— on that ground alone it would not havebeen justifiable : — but as it was also in conformity with theprinciples of the general law, it was both justifiable andexpedient — the wards being tantamount to hundreds; andthe aldermen, being as shown before, in fact constables.The mayor of Leicester and his brethren, having, with theconsent of the commonalty, by the last ordinance, placed thetown under the government of the aldermen, appear, in the4th year of the reign of King Henry VIL, to have adopted 1488.a still further expedient to prevent those disturbances whichhad accompanied the elections at Leicester, and a mandatefor that purpose was issued to the borough. Before we stateit, however, it may be necessary to recall the attention of thereader to the statute of the 8th of Henry VL relative to theelection of knights of the shire, which recites, that," Whereasthe election of knights of shires to Parliament, in manycounties, have now of late been made by very great outrageousand excessive number of people dwelling withinthe same counties, of the which most part was of peopleof small substance, and of no value, whereof every of themitua€€230 LEICESTER.Domcrfay. u pretended a voice equivalent as to such elections to be^toSSSS?"

It is directedto the mayor, bailiffs, comburgesses and burgesses of the townof Leicester, kc; and recites ^that, forasmuch as ^that at*' every election of the mayor or a burgess of the Parliament,*' —or at assessing of any lawful imposition, — the commasnatty of the said town, as well poor as rich, have always*^ assembled at the common hall; whereas such persons be of*^ little substance or reason, and not contributors, or else fall** little to the charge sustained in such behalf, and have had<< great interest through their exclamations and redness, to*^ the subversion, not only of the good policy of the saidtown, but likely to the often breach of the peace, and otherinconveniences increasing, and causing the full misery and** decline of our said town, and to the great discouragementof some of the governors there — for reformation whereof,and to the intent that good rule and substantial order may*^ be had and entertained there from henceforth, the king*^ strictly charges the said mayor, bailiff, and 24 comburges-^* ses of the said town now being, that at all common halls'^ and assemblies thereafter to be holden there, as well for theelection of the mayor, of the justices of the peace, and burgessesof our Parliaments, as also of passing of any lawfulimpositions, or otherwise — they jointly choose and call*^ unto them the bailiff of the said town for the time being,'^ and also 48 of the most wise and sad commoners, inhabitantsthere, after the discretions of the said commonalty, and nomore ; and there to order and direct all matters occurrentor supervening among you, as by the reason and conscienceshall be thought lawful and most expedient.uiiLEICESTER. 231Given at our palace of Westminster, under pur seal of our Do'ng'*<'*y-'* said Dutch, the 2d day of August, 4th year of ourNorthwnp-reign LeiiTr-^ By council of our said Dutch of Lancaster." "^^'®*However great the inconveniences necessaryconsequence of which is — ^that a person who had left a placefor a year and a day, would, in the ordinary course, becomea sworn and enrolled inhabitant of another place. And asby Magna Charta, he could not be bound to do this royalsuit and service in two places, his superinduced liability inanother — discharged him from his former liability, and hewould cease to be an inhabitant of the place to whichhe had previously belonged. If, therefore, he should returnhe would be then treated as a stranger his connectionwith it having been broken. And he would pay a fine, eitheras a contribution for the period during which he had ceasedto pay to the public stock, or as a security against anyclaim to be made upon the borough, for any act which hemight have done during his absence from it.We should however observe, that, in this entry, the wordcorporation" is introduced, although, as the reader has hada full opportunity of j edging, from the documents before citedwith reference to this place, that there is no pretence forsaying, that this borough was entitled at that time to the appellationof a body corporate.We must remember, it was in the reigns of Queen Maryand Queen Elizabeth, that all the former charters to Leicesterwere confirmed. And none of them spoke of it as a corporation.That term was, in fact, first introduced in the timeof Henry VL, — but in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, hadLEICESTER. 239become common, both in practice and ordinary usage. The Dmrorf^.adoption of the tenn therefore, with respect to Leicester is ^JJ'^'^p-easily accounted for ; but at the same time it is apparent LeiSier-That it was altogether unjustified. ■**^*In the 28th wear of the same reign, in a case which occurred 1585.28 Elizin the King's S^9S!Sl1$^^ plaintiff insisted, upon the authorityof the extract Ak^mnesday, which we have before quoted,that Leicester was held in ancient demesne, and that theinhabitants were discharged of toll, as appeared by thequeen's letters patent. But there was no claim of anyexemption as a corporation, or in respect of any corporateright or charter, although the case was discussed at muchlength, and many exceptions were taken and answered.Sir Edward Coke, in the course of giving his judgment, said,that towns were before manors ; and that London, though ithad the name of ancient demesne, had not the liberties belongingto it And Shute Justice said, that inhabitants withinancient demesne, although not tenants, should have the privilege;— san observation much in accordance with what wehave before urged, as to these and borough rights dependingupon inhabitancy, and not tenure He adds, that tenantsat will, in ancient demesne, should be disclaimed of toll aswell as tenants of the freehold, for life or for years ; for whichhe cites the 27th of Henry VL, c. 37.Mile said, that London was ancient demesne; for thecitizens prescribed — ^that a villain who hath there dweltshould not be taken from thence by capias or attachment : —establishing — that the doctrine of villainage was, even atthat time, continued; though villainage itself had fallen intodesuetude; — and that exemption from the liability of avillain, depended on residence; as it did from the earliestperiods, and as recognized expressly in Glanville. —-butBilling rejoined (as the fact is), that London is not inDomesday.We may therefore assume from the general features of thiscase, and from the grounds upon which it was argued, that• Leon, ii. 190.240 LEICESTER.DopM>id*y. although Leicester was entitled at that time to privilegeNorthunp. as having been held in ancient demesne, it teas not then aLeioMtra- P<w^^wn. It seems, that after the discussion of this case, it^^^^ was felt by the inhabitants, that they wanted the addition.!character of incorporation, which many cities and boroughshad at that time acquired. And therefore, in three yearsafterwards, we find, that an application was made to thequeen for a charter of incorporation.31 ^•' ^* ^^ *^® common practice of Queen Elizabeth — or atleast, of her advisers — ^to insert in the commencement of thecharters of that period, a recital, that the places had beforeenjoyed franchises by prescription, or had been incorporated ;of which, we shall perhaps have occasion to cite a variety ofinstances. This expedient was probably resorted to, fromthe new doctrine as to corporations having pointed out thenecessity of aggregate bodies being clothed with that privilege ;and there is not a more decisive proof of the recent introductionof that doctrine, than the change which took placein the recitals of the charters subsequent to the reign ofHenry VI. ^ when the first incorporation was created.Queen Elizabeth therefore recites in her charter to Leicesterthat the borough had existed corporate of one mayor and 24aldermen, and one other society, commonly called the forty*eight ; and that the mayor and the said society had beenincorporated by her progenitors. The queen then proceeds tocreate in Leicester, a body corporate and politic, for ever ; toconsist of one mayor, 24 aldermen, and 48 burgesses of theinhabitantSy under the name of '^ Mayor and burgesses of thetown of Leicester ;" and grants, that they should be capable tohold and sell lands, — ^to plead and be impleaded-'^that oneof the aldermen should be elected mayor every year-andthat they, the mayor and burgesses, should enjoy all formerprivileges. The charter also provides for the election ofmayor.Certain shambles are likewise granted to the borough, —and directions are given concerning the lands and hospitalsof the town.• Pat 31 EUi.p.l2.LEICESTER. 241Although this charter recites, that Leicester had thereto doomsday.fore been a corporations yet, as care has been taken toNortbMjj-State all the previous charters of this borough, the reader LeiSietPswill be satisfied, that the recital is, in point of fact, unfounded.1589*The confirmation of the former charters, up to the 5th year 31 eUz,of the same reign, is decisive upon this point; and to everyunprejudiced mind it must be clear, that Leicester untilthis period was not incorporated.The inconveniences resulting from the grant of this charter 33 eiJ j.of incorporation, being soon felt, a petition was presentedto the queen, complaining of the abuse of her majesty'slate grant to the corporation ; by which the poor were oppressed,— and many private individuals enriched by indirectnieans. And it was accordingly agreed, to prevent therecurrence of such abuses, — that whosoever should be foundguilty of similar acts, should be dismissed the company, anddisfranchised.The change of language in this entry, is apparent. TieinhabitantSy and the men commorant and abiding in the place,are no longer spoken of; but the term used is, the "company,"— evidently attempting to assume, in pursuance ofthe incorporation, the character, and terms properly applicableto guilds and fraternities.Another instance also occurs, in which the entries attemptto give the municipal government a more immediate connectionwith trade, than it before possessed; for we findit agreed, that every freeman using his trade elsewhere, ^^'who did not return home nightly to his house in Leicester,should pay weekly, double in every payment to all charges,watch and ward, &c. And if he did not return home, andcontinue in the town, as inhabitants ought, before the conceptionof our Lady next, he should pay for every week heso continued out afterwards, 40^. a week, to the use of thevisited and poor people.Nevertheless, this entry proves, — ^that the system ofwatch and ward still continued; and that every inhabitanthouseholder was liable to it. So that, although the placehad been incorporated, the ancient system of municipalVOL. I. B'J\I «V242 LEICESTER.Domawky. government and liability was still preserved unaltered: —^tomlSSt establishing, — with many other facts, which in the courseLeicester ^^ ^^^ ^^^^^f wc shall adduce, — that incorporation was^^' only a collateral superinduced capability; in no respectsubstantially altering either the general or local law ;excepting only, as to the capacity of holding in successionand acting — as an aggregate body, under one commonname.We should also observe, that this entry affords an instanceof the poor being at that time paid out of the commonstock.1599. Queen Elizabeth, in the 41st year of her reign,* grantedanother charter of incorporation to Leicester, somewhatresembling the former. It is to this effect. — It commencesby reciting, "That whereas, our borough of Leicester, inour county of Leicester, is an ancient and populous borough,and from ancient times, was a borough incorporate ;and the inhabitants and their predecessors, had held hitherto,divers liberties, franchises, privileges, and immunities,by divers prescriptions and customs in the sameborough, from time of memory, &c., and by divers concessionsand grants from our progenitors."The charter then makes Leicester a free borough; andthe burgesses and their successors a body politic and corporate,under the name of" mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses of theborough of Leicester ;" — ^with powers to sell and purchaselands ; and to plead and be impleaded by their corporatename. And granting to the corporation, for the first time,a common seal ; — the mayor and aldermen to have powerof making laws for the good government of the burgesses,artificers, and inhabitants. It is also directed, that thereshould be a mayor and two bailiffs; and 24 honest anddiscreet men, inhabiting and abiding within the borough,who should be called aldermen of the borough ; — and 48other honest and discreet men, inhabiting and commorantwithin the borough, commonly called the company of eight-and-forty:— but that in future they should be called theRot.

NorthamptonshireOther provisions, usual in charters of that time, are then Lci^ter-added. And it is provided — ^that the mayor, recorder, and *^^*four aldermen, should be justices of the peace. After whichfollows a grant of view of frank-pledge of all the inhabitantsand resiants within the borough, to be holden twice a year,before the mayor, bailiffs, steward, &c. ; and it is provided,that no foreigner should buy or sell any merchandise withinthe borough, except in gross, but only in the time of fairs,markets, &c. Jurisdiction is given to the mayor, bailiffs, andburgesses, over the bishop's fee, &c. &c.; there is a grant ofa market for wool, &c. ; — ^and all the former privileges andgrants to the borough are confirmed.This charter, like the preceding one of the 31st of Elizabeth,falsely recites, — ^that Leicester had been, from ancient times,a body corporate ; but it speaks of the privileges which hadbeen previously enjoyed by the inhabitants ; and describesthe persons who were to be eligible to ofBces, in the languageanciently applied to them, as '^ abiding and cormorant" inthe borough. And it should be observed, — that as the municipalgovernment of the place is provided for, by the creationof justices and other officers ; so also the view of frankpledge,so important a privilege connected with the exclusivejurisdiction of the borough, is granted and confirmed.A charter of King James I.* recites that of the 41st of '^fsJg,Elizabeth, and grants to the mayor and aldermen, the go-james.vehement of the lands of the corporation; and directs, —that the mayor and aldermen, and 24 of the ancients of thecompany of the 48, should have power to make laws forthe regulation and devising of the lands ; to which the commonseal is to be affixed in their presence ; and without suchconsent they are to be void. After other usual provisions, itrecites, that Queen Elizabeth, for the better relief of the poorof the town, had granted, that the mayor, bailiffs, and burgessesmight hold a wool market; — ^and in the conclusion,it confirms all the former liberties.• Rot.

That the mayor, bailiffs and burgesses, hadby petition suggested to the king, that, near to the town,there existed several places, commonly called Cotton End,West Cotton, and St. James, without the jurisdiction of thetown, and where artificers, mechanics, manufacturers, andother free burgesses of the town, went to reside; and severalarts and mysteries were used there, to the prejudice and injuryof the town, and the burgesses and inhabitants of the same.And in order that all the inhabitants and residents in the sameplaces might be under the rule and governance of the mayor,bailiffs and burgesses, the king granted to the mayor, bailiffsand burgesses, that the limits of the town should extend asprayed; that Northampton should be, in conjunction withthem, a free town ; that the burgesses there should for everbe one body, corporate and politic, by the name of " TheMayor, Bailiffs and Burgesses of the Town of Northampton'*The usual corporate powers follow, with the appointmentof the mayor, two bailiffs, and 48 of the most worthy anddiscreet men, inhabitant and commorant within the town,commonly called the company of Eight-and-forty, to be thecommon council, in conjunction with those burgesses whohad served the oflSce of mayor or bailiff.Power was then given to make bye-laws.Rot.

Thepersons, therefore, who were burgesses at those periods —and they were always the same class, for there had beennothing to change them — were those who had the right tovote. They could not be the corporation, — ^because we haveseen, that that body was not created until about 50 yearsbefore this period. The committee, therefore, most properlyresolved, — that " the commonalty as well as the bailiffs,aldermen, and ** common councilmen, had a right toelect''In 1661, Mr. Serjeant Charlton reported many " mis *66i.carriages" of the mayor of Northampton, and for which thatofficer was committed to the custody of the serjeant-alarms,and reprimanded.

So that it appears — whatever charters weregranted — the inhabitants were nevertheless constantly treatedas the burgesses of the borough — ^in which character alone,they could be entitled to vote for members of Parliament.No further discussion as to the right of election for Northamptonappears: and therefore it must be considered asindisputable — that the inhabitants always were, and now properlyare, — the burgesses of Northampton.21 Cw-?il. ''^^ charter of the 15th of Charles II. to Northampton,was brought under the consideration of the Court of King'sBench, in the 21st year of that monarch's reign, upon anapplication by a person of the name of Braithwaite, foramandamus to restore him to his office of alderman.* Inthe return to the writ, the corporation set forth an amoveal,under the powers granted to them by that charter; — andthe return was supported by the court.1683. In the 35th of Charles II., the charter of the 15th of thatking was, like those of many other places, surrendered, andanother granted — with the illegal clause, vesting the powerof placing and displacing the officers in the crown. But thesurrender not having been enrolled, the new charter was,by the opinion of Sir Edward North, the then attorneysBraithwaite's Case, Vent. i. p. 19.NORTHAMPTON. 247general, considered not binding, — and therefore the borough ^o™^-acted upon that of the 15th of Charles II. until 1796, when ^^^tthe burgesses received another charter : — the consideration Leinsterof which we shall postpone to a subsequent period.* ' "*In 1769, it appears, that, notwithstanding the commitment ^769.and reprimand of the mayor in 1661, the mayor and townclerk assumed the right of admitting persons to be freemenof Northampton who had not any previous title, by birth,servitude, — or election; and, in consequence, a quowarranto was applied for against them, in Michaelmasterm of that years The rule was made absolute, after asearch for precedents ; and, upon the authority of the Hertfordcase, (to which we have before referred ) — the Lost-withalcase, in the 7th of Queen Anne — the Liverpool caseinthe 3rd of George II. — ^and the New Radnor case, in the32nd George II. The information was accordingly filed;and is given at length in the report, as well as the plea,setting forth, that they had been a body corporate 'fromtime immemorial (contrary to the fact, as we have beforeshown) : that there had been immemorially a mayor and atown clerk (for which assertion there was not the slightestpretence). It then detailed the charter of the 15th ofCharles 11. : — the power under it of making bye-laws ;and alleged a usage, — ^that the mayor and town clerk had,from time immemorial, been used to admit to the freedomall persons having a right to be admitted, either by birthor servitude, or by any order of the mayor, bailiffs, andburgesses, or in any other manner howsoever. That themayor and bailiffs, and the major part of such of the burgesseswho theretofore had been mayors and bailiffs,and the 48, made a bye-law, that persons not entitled bybirth or servitude, should thereafter be admitted on thepayment of 10/. ; — except such as had married the daughterof a freeman, and those upon the payment of 5Z.

Thereby expressly negativingthe power of the mayor and town clerk to make freemenor burgesses. It is also obvious, that the right of electingand nominating them, claimed by the common council inthe information, was likewise without any lawful foundation;because none of the charters, creating or recognising thatbody, gave to them any such power. And a£ burgesses hadexisted long before the common council, it is clear — thatthey must have been anciently sworn, enrolled, and admitted,in some other manner— which we have shown, by our earlylaws, to have been — sat the court leet. The ftict is, — ^that noneof the early charters, — as we shall see hereafter — providefor the admission of freemen or burgesses; and very fewof the more modem charters. Some other mode, thereforeof creating burgesses must be looked for ; and no plausiblesolution of that difficulty can be surmised, but that obviousone, which the common law suggests, — of their being admitted,sworn, and enrolled, at the Court Leet of theborough, in respect of their resiancy within it — whereby,being freemen ofy or belonging to the borough, they were itsburgesses.Leicester.But to return to the Borough of Leicester 41664.

LeiSSoer-In 1706, the right of election came before a committee of ' !t ^the House of Commons ; and it was admitted, on both sides, to * Anne. / ^ .be in — the freemen not receiving alms — and in the inhabitants j /paying scot and lot, which has never been varied or questioned. ' . 'In the course of the investigation, an inquiry was instituted,(of which traces may be found in many other places,)as to the right of the certificate men to vote ; and it was resolved,— that they were not entitled, unless they had obtaineda settlement, — which again establishes, that the same fact of p ,permanent residence ought by lady to settle the three importantquestions f of burgess-ship— the right of voting for merhers of Parliament — and the right of parochial settlement.Many of the voters were objected to, on both sides, asbeing made free at the charge of the candidates. — ^A circumstanceshowing how open this mode of admission of freemenis to abuse, — and how ready a means of corruption it affords.Before we quit this part of the case, it should be remembered,that here the right of election is decided to be in thefreemen — and — the inhabitants paying scot and lot — ^whichis an absurdity upon the face of it ; for as the only questionwas, who were the burgesses — and they could obviously bebut of one class — it would seem impossible that a doublequalification, like the one here adopted, could be supported ;because if either of those rights were established, it negativedthe other, — sunless the freemen were also inhabitant householderspaying scot and lot — ^in which case it was unnecessaryto introduce the freemen at all; because — they would beentitled in their other right, as inhabitant householders payingscot and lot. On the contrary, — ^if the freemen were nonresident,and not inhabitants, — ^then their right would negativeits being in the inhabitants. In fact, they cannot bothexist as separate rights ; either they are the same, and resolvethemselves into each other — or, if they are different,they are contrary to each other, and one only can be thereal right.250 LEICESTER.Domesday. Such are the intricacies and difficulties which accompanyNorthamp- a departure from the simplicity of our ancient common law —Leicester ^^^1^* ^7 adhering to its principles the whole is rendered asshire, clear and distinct as truth generally is. As long as the distinctionexisted between freemen and villains, freemen only wereentitled to the independent privileges of the state : — ^if theyi * lived in the county at large, they enjoyed them in that \ '^ tensive district :— on the other hand, if they inhabited in aborough, they enjoyed it within that limit; and, being offree condition and inhabiting there, they were, in the simplelanguage of the law, the men, or there burgesses, of thatborough.Thus the decision of the committee, as to the right ofvoting for Leicester, should be considered — and in that manneronly can it be reconciled with the general law, and thedocuments we have quoted.1767. Before however concluding this case, we ought to notice'7C* TTT ' ^a decision in the King's Bench,* of the 7th George III., upona mandamus to restore one James Sidney to the office ofalderman ; the return to which stated, as the ground for theremoval, that Sidney had departed with his emily fromLeicester, with an intent to reside, inhabit, and dwell withhis family, for the future, elsewhere; and from thence didcontinually abide, reside, inhabit, and dwell with his family,out of the borough. This return the court held to be insufficient,upon grounds which, with submission, appear tobe untenable. Lord Mansfield said, that ** the applicant had^* not totally left the borough: — she was. only absent aboutfour months." Now the return is expressly to the contrary,for it states, — ^that he had departed with his family, andentirely left the same ; and had continually abode, resided,inhabited and dwelt with his family, out of the borough.The Chief Justice, in his judgment, seems to have mistakennon-residence for absence. If a person usually resides in aplace, but quits it for a short time, either with or withouthis family, still keeping his domicile in the borough, wherebyhe can be chained and assessed, and where he can be sum-rexV.

But if he abandons his dwell Po"»^y-dingy takes away his family, and removes his domicile to '^jj^hire^'another place, — ^this is not absence, but non-residence : LeiSS^er-he leaves one place of residence and adopts another. ' "'The case in question was not, properly speaking, somuch a cause of removal, (as said by Lord Holt, in VaughanV. Lewis, Earth. 227,) as an actual abandonment of all rightsof a burgess, and all privileges belonging to that character. —Therefore, when that fact had been established before themayor and aldermen, they were justified in treating theapplicant as no longer a burgess ; but absolutely out of hisoffice. — In truth, the same as if he had been dead. Nosummons of him could be necessary, as reason plainly dictates; because he could not be compelled to come ; for helived out of the borough, the officers of which had no powerto summon beyond the limits : — therefore, for every practicalpurpose, the proper mode of considering the case was, — asone of absolute desertion of the office.'The intention stated in the return was needlessly andimproperly added ; for, if he had actually left that place,and resided in another, — ^itwas immaterial what his intentionwas, and that allegation ought to have been rejected assurplusage. Nevertheless, Mr. Justice Yates seems to haverested his judgment upon it, as he asks, ** How can the coreportion know his intention ? How did they know he didnot intend to return ? He might have altered his intentionsTo which interrogatories the answer is, — that they did know hisintention, as far as it was necessary to be known — for theyknew that he had actually left the borough. And as to hisintention to return, or of his having altered his mind, it wastotally immaterial ; for, if he did either the one or the other,he must have come in again as a fresh inhabitant, andhave been re-admitted.Lord Mansfield also added, that '^ they had never askedhim, or given him notice of the charge." This observationis founded upon two erroneous assumptions, — first, that noticeought, or could have been given ; and 2dly, that any chargewas necessary to remove him. The fact was, he had actually252 LEICESTER.Domesday, removed himself, and made a vacancy in the office by^toi^re " withdrawing himself from the borough. . On the groundsLeiSrter- therefore suggested by the court, it is submitted, that this*'*' judgment cannot be supported.There is, however, one point which might perhaps haveafforded a solid ground upon which the case could havebeen determined. The legal rights and obligations of manyclasses of persons are frequently changed under the law,by actual residence for a year and a day ; and therefore, ifthe court had said, that not having resided a year and a dayaway from the borough, he had neither thrown off his oldrights there, — nor adopted new ones, in the place of his recentresidence — he was not removed from his office, unless hedisclaimed it — the case would have been decided upon aplain practical ground, and such a decision might have beenuseful for a future guide, as in accordance with the generallaw,— and in conformity with the entries we have beforeseen in the books of this borough. A committee of the Houseof Commons adopted the same principle, in the case ofNewcastle-undergone in 1703.* There are also other placesrespecting which similar determinations have been made, —and other occasions upon which the same doctrine has beenrecognised.There is another case relating to Leicester,-}- but whichcontains nothing material to the subject of our present inquiry,excepting that it recites the charters of Edward IV.,Henry VII. and Queen Elizabeth : and there is also in thestatement of that case, some of the confusion of burgesseswith freemen, upon which we have before commented.Both those classes could not exist as separate bodies in theborough : the fact being — that the condition of a freemanis only a qualification for being a burgess, if the personlived within the borough. The charters all tend to show,that there was only one class originally existing — and oneclass subsequently incorporated — which were the burgesses:that is, the inhabitant householders paying scot and lot,See Journal, p. 315.t Blankly v.

Thenfollows an enumeration of the measure which each of thebarons possesses, amounting altogether to 116 — four ofwhich are stated to be waste on account of the site of thecastle. Besides these, one house is mentioned — and 13belonging to other barons. But nothing is said, with respectto these houses, as to any burgesses ; although 19 burgessesare mentioned as having 19 masuree. There is therefore aclear distinction between the houses and the masuree : thelatter seem each to have their burgess; the former, probably,had not, on the ground we have mentioned before — eitherof their being held by persons who were exempt fromborough duties ; or excused by their poverty ; which theoccupier of a masuree could not well be ; as it was a house1264 WARWICK.— TAMWORTH.Domesday. ^j^j^ jj^j annexed to it. The 19 burgesses entered imme-Warwick lately afterwards as having 19 masurs, clearly prove thatSuircthey were householders ; and they are described as having socand sac. " There is sac and soc" — ^that is, a jurisdiction oftheir own — ^which they had enjoyed from the time of KingEdward, again showing, — that at this early period e exclusivejurisdiction was one of the characteristic privileges enjoyedby boroughs ; and inhabitant householders the persons whoenjoyed them.Foi.2^. Amongst the possessions of Hugo de Grentemaisnil, inMarston, in Rarely hundred, is an entry of two Frenchmenthere ; and two burgesses in Warwick, render 16d.; andin Gillespie, one house in Warwick — confirming the inference,that the burgesses resided in Warwick. Particularly as inthe next entry, of Pilardetune, there is mention of one majora(one of the baron's houses mentioned before) in Warwick,which rendered 4rf.It is impossible not to assume, that this was the descriptionof a house locally situated in the town of Warwick,rendering rent to the manor of Pilardetune.Foi.s4s,B. 'j'jjg game occurs in Tiheshoche, in Keyhole Hundred, asFol.243. to the houses of Robert de Stratford in Warwick ; and thoseof Half de Limes, as to the manor of Becclelove; and William,the son of Corbucion, as to the manor of Burlie : — ^fromwhence it appears, that, although the houses were in theborough, they were held of the several manors under whichthey are here entered, and were not held by burgage tenure.Fol.244. The entry of Haselove is thus : — " These two Frenchmenand one burgess pay ?}{£.'' But it does not appear wherethe burgess lived : — it only states, that he paid so much tothis manor — probably he was a burgess of Warwick; as wehave seen, that Warwick and Tamworth are the only boroughsmentioned in this county.TAMWORTH.Ten burgesses in Tamworth are described as belonging tothe manor of Coleshelle: — indicating, that although the* burgessesheld their lands or houses of this manor, they residedCoventry-STAFFORD. 255in Tamworth : — the residence making them burgesses of that Do»p«d& y.iTarwicshire.place. Warwick-twopersons who held lands are described as freemen, " etliberi homines feint."Many freemen are mentioned as tenants ; as well as otherindividuals : — some as holding their lands freely. The sameform of entry occurs through the whole county.Women are also described as free.And it should be observed, that those who are calledfreemen, are not belonging to any borough or corporation,but are entered in the county at large.COVENTRY.Coventry, which is now a borough, is not mentioned assuch in Domesday; but only as one of the possessions ofthe Countess Godiva.STAFFORDSHIRE.STAFFORD.In this county there were three parliamentary boroughs — Fol. 246.viz. Lichfield, — Stafford, — and Newcastle-undergone, — besidesTamworth,— which is partly in Warwickshire. Ofthese, only one — ^viz. Stafford, — ^is expressly mentioned asaborough ; the entry of that place occurs separately fromthe county, and before the lands of the king.STAFFORD.It is described as a borough ; and, amongst other things,it is said, that the king hath in his demesne 18 burgesses,and eight waste manses — apparently connecting togetherthe burgesses and the manses, as has occurred previously inthe entry of Warwick. Eighteen other burgesses in Staffordare entered in the possessions of Earl Rc^er, as belonging Foi. 248.to the manor of Merton.Amongst the lands of the king, the entry as to Wigetane Foi. 246.«266 STAFFORD.Domesday. mentions f OUT burgesses, and that as to Drayton eight bur-staffordffesseSy in Tamuuorde; — from whence it appears, — that theburgesses of that place, like many others previously mentioned,though tenants or dependents of other manors, wereyet called burgesses of the boroughs where they resided ;for these entries describe them as being in the borough —thereby showing they were inhabitants of the place : — andnegativing, that it was in right of their tenancy, or dependency,that they were burgesses.Tamworth however must, by some means, have ceasedto be a borough before the 9th year of the reign of Edward^ ' ' II.; because, at that time, the sheriff of Stafford returnedto a writ — which required him, amongst other things, tocertify how many boroughs there were in his bailiwick —that there was only one — ^namely, Stafford.* Probably Tamworthhad ceased to be a borough before the reign of HenryIII. ; for it is not mentioned amongst the boroughs which,in the 49th year of this king, returned members to theCouncil of De Mountford ; and, in the 7th year of his reign,in the roll of a talliage, in which Stafford is mentioned as aborough, Tamworth is called " village."FoLS48,B. There is a passage in the survey of this county whichmay require an observation — as Brady and others havebeen led into error respecting this, and similar entries.Henry de Ferieres is stated to have " a castle of Toteberiein the borough," — apparently separate from each otheras we have had frequent occasion to assert. — It isthen added, " about the castle there are 42 men, living ontheir own merchandise, (^de mercator suo,J" which has beenrendered as if they were homines de mercator de Toteberie.Brady translates a similar passage, to meet his own viewsrespecting guild merchants, as describing *men belongingto the marhet^^f It must be obvious to the reader, thateach of these translations is unwarranted by the text, whichmerely imports, that they lived from their own trade ormerchandise.Vide post., Hist, of the borough of Stafford.t Bra.

If in anycase it could be said, that the right of election was given byVOL. I. 6258 SHREWSBURY.Domctdty. fj^^ charter of the crown, it would be in this ; — ^because Tarn-staffordWorth never had returned members to Parliament beforethe charter, but did immediately after ; and yet, — notwithstandingthere was one determination, giving the right tothe select body — ^and another, including the freeholders ; — ithas eventually been brought back to its proper and legitimatechannel, and vested in the inhabitants paying scot and lot —both the former usurpations being rejected.Stafford which is the most ancient brought has no traceof having exercised a burgage-tenure right of voting ; butis converted into a corporation borough.Lichfield, which is not mentioned as a borough in Domesday,has assigned to it — amongst a variety of anomalousrights of voting — that of burgage-tenure — upon the alliedground, that it was an ancient borough,' ' In Newcastle, where, in the reign of James L, the returnwas claimed by the select body, the right of voting afterwardspassed through a course apparently connected with theCourt Leet, into a regular corporate right of election, bythe open conversion of the term burgess into freeman — thosewords being first used, in the resolution of 1706, in the disjunctive— burgess or freeman; and, in 1792, the former isrejected altogether, and the word 'freeman'' alone retained— although by the writ and precept, the returnis to be of two burgesses, to be elected by the burgesses,out of themselves."SHROPSHIRE.Shrewsbury.In this county there were five parliamentary boroughs,Shrewsbury — Bridgeport — Ludlow — Wedlock — Bishop'sCastle— of which Shrewsbury is the only one mentioned inDomesday.SHREWSBURY.SHREWSBURY.Domesday.Shropshire.The entry of Shrewsbury is separate from the county, andprecedes the land of the Bishop of Chester — the king notappearing to have any land in demesne in Shropshire.This place, like Leicester, is entered as a city ; and there Fol. 252.seems a difficulty in accounting for that name being appliedto it, as there is no appearance of episcopal or ecclesiasticaljurisdiction — unless the Bishop of Chester having possessionsthere, were sufficient for that purpose.It does not, however, seem to be a material distinction —because the burgesses are mentioned shortly after ; and therecan be no doubt, that with reference to the subject of ourpresent inquiry — cities and boroughs were substantially thesine.In the time of King Edward, there is stated to have been** 252 houses, and as many burgesses in the same houses,** rendering gable." A decisive instance, in addition to thosewe have already mentioned, that the burgesses were inhabitanthouseholders in the borough.The entry afterwards repeats many of the provisions ofthe Saxon laws ; and states — ^that when the king lay in thecity, 12 men, of the best of the city, served him watching.And when he hunted there, the better burgesses, havinghorses, guarded him, with arms, &c.There is one part of the entry which, as matter of curiousresearch, may be mentioned, for the purpose of showing howwatchful the ancient law was as to fire — for it even punished,in the owner of the house, an accidental burning. A matterin the present crowded state of our cities, worthy, perhaps,to some extent, of the consideration of the Legislature. Theentry is, " if the house of a burgess should be burnt by anyaccident or event, without negligence, he shall give tothe king, for forfeiture, 40^. — and to his two next neigh-hours,2s, each."Part of the render of this borough was paid to the sheriff.The entry then proceeds : —The English burgesses of Shrewsbury say,— that muchs 2/V260 SHREWSBURY.Domesday, injury is donc to them, because they render as much geldshops they rendered in the time of King Edward — althoughthe Castle of the Earl hath occupied 51 measure, other60 masursB are waste : — and 43 French burgesses hold paying geld in the time of King Edward. The Earlhimself hath given to the abbey which he makes there, 39^y burgesses, formerly likewise geldahU with the others. Inthe whole, there are 200 measure — seven less, which do notpay geld.This entry affords another instance of the separation ofj > the castle from the borough, in respect of which it is alleged,1 * — that the geld of 51 measures ought to be deducted from' thegeld of the borough, because they were enclosed withinthe castle. The same entry supplies us also with an instanceof an exemption claimed for lands which were givenfor ecclesiastical purposes ; and at the close of that part ofthe return which relates to the borough, it appears — ^thatmany naturae, as well as houses, were exempt from thepayment of the geld, — in all probability on account of thegrounds of exemption, to which we have so frequently beforereferred.The Bishop of Chester is stated to have in Shrewsbury16 measure ; and cls many burgesses ^ who pay geld withthe other burgesses — there are now of them 10 waste, andthe other six render 4*. Id. The same bishop has in thesame city 16 canons, and they do not pay geld; nor is itknown how much they render to the bishop.Here we have an instance of both species of ecclesiastical^ / property, belonging to the bishop : — one which paid geld, —Y \ J and the other which did not ; — the former in the possession\ of the burgesses ; the other of the canons, who were personsdedicated to religion.In the city of Shrewsbury, Earl Roger is making an abbey,and gives to the same the monastery of St. Peter, where wasthe parish church of the city, and so much of his burgessesand mills as render 12/. to the monks.• It should be observed, that this appears to be the firstinstance in which a parish is mentioned ; and from the entryCHESTER. 261Domesday.it IB clear, that the lands which the burgesses occupied, —though the rent was given to the monks, — still continued to Shopsgeld, and the occupiers to be burgesses.There is a subsequent entry of nine burgesses in the city, foi. 260, b.belonging to the manor of Melam.Upon this entry it is unnecessary to make any observationsbesides those already suggested.CHESHIRE.CHESTER.In this county only one borough is entered ; viz. the city fol m, b. *of Chester, which is returned by itself, at considerable length,with many provisions of the Saxon laws.Some of the lands belonging to Chester, are spoken of asbeing without the city ; and the Bishop's borough is mentioned,for which it is difficult to account. The entry wehave referred to in Shrewsbury, respecting fires, is in substancerepeated — as it is said, ^* If the city was burnt, he'^ from whose house it began made amends by three ores of** money ; and to his nearest neighbours 3^.''In another part of the entry it is stated, there were 12judges of the city : — and these were of the king, the bishop,and the earl. If one remained from the Hundred Court onthe day on which it sat, he made amends by lOs. betweenthe king and the earl.The reader will not fail to be convinced, that these werethe jury sworn at the court, whose more especial duty itwas to attend there ; and for their default they paid a largerfine than other suitors.The County and Hundred Courts are both mentioned.The entry then concludes thus : — " The land in which is thechurch of St. Peter, which Robert de Rowland claimed asthane land (as the county proved) never belonged to the .'^ manor without the city, but belongs to the borough, and262 CHESTER.Domesday. « always was in the custom of the king and earl, as theCheshire. " other burgesses."We have here, therefore, a clear distinction between themanor which was without the city, and that which belongedto the jurisdiction of the borough ; and that the consequenceof being within that jurisdiction was, — that it paid all customslike the other burgesses. We may in conclusionobserve, that from this latter part of the entry it is obvious —the city and borough were in substance the same : — at leastwith regard to the subject of our present inquiry.Pol. 263. B. Ten burgesses in the city are stated as belonging to theFoL 266» B. manor of Wivreham ; and eight to the manor of Clarendon ;and 15 to the manor of Dodestune.Fol.263. The church of St. John is stated to have in the city eighthouses ; and the church of St. Wereburgh 13 houses in thecity, free from all customs.The burgesses of two other boroughs are also mentionedin Domesday; 18 of Roelend, and six of Teneverdent. OfFol.269. the latter nothing further is stated, but the entry of theformer is as follows : — Earl Hugh held of the king in thetime of King Edward, Engulfed, and the whole was waste.Edwin the earl held it when Hugh the earl received this;it was also waste. Now he has in demesne half the castle,which is called Relent, which is the head of this land ; therehe has eight burgesses; half of the church, and of themint ; half of the mine of iron, wherever it is found in themanor; and half the water of Choice.The next entry states, that Robert de Relent holds ofHugo the count, half of the castle and borough ; in whichthe same Robert has 12 burgesses, and half of the church,and of the mint, and of the iron mine, wheresoever found ;and half of the water of Cloth.In the next column there is also an entry to the followingeffect: — In the same manor of Roelend is made a newcastle,also called Roelend. There is a new borough, and init 18 burgesses f between the earl and Robert as aforesaid.To the same burgesses are granted the laws and customswhich are in Hereford and in Greville, &c.CHESTER. 263In the first part of the entry of the lands of Earl Hugh, Po"«>^y-the castle and burgesses are so mentioned as to raise, at first Cheshire,sight, the inference, that the castle and borough sere thesame; but the subsequent mention of them both, in the /entry of the lands of Robert de Relent, destroys that in-/,jterence, and confirms the doctrine we have before insisted ^^upon, — of the castles and boroughs being separate anddistinct from each other.These entries of Chester and Cheshire are long and minute,but afford no further information upon the subject of ourpresent inquiry, beyond that which we have collected fromprevious entries ; although, therefore, the particular historyof Chester, so conspicuous both in municipal and parliamentarylitigation, is of great importance : — yet we shallpostpone the investigation of it till a further opportunity,when it may be introduced with more advantage.NOTTINGHAMSHIRE AND DERBYSHIRE.NOTTINGHAM, DBRBYjNEWARK.In the entry of Derbyshire, there is little mention either ^o'- ^72.of any borough or burgesses. Derby, the only borough init, is entered at the close of the return, with Nottingham ;each being separate from the counties to which they belong.It is only necessary further to remark, that it is not Fol.280.divided as the preceding counties into hundreds, but, likeNottinghamshire, into wapentakes.Of the boroughs of Nottingham and Derby, Nottinghamis first given : they are both described as boroughs, and eac|;ias having many burgesses; Nottingham 173, and Derby 243,residing in the time of King Edward. Those in Nottinghamhad been reduced, in the time of the survey, to 120: — andthose of Derby to 100 : — and there were 40 minores.Besides the above entries, we find in Nottinghamshire the264 NOTTINGHAM.Domes ay, ting's villains mentioned ; and the Saxon laws introduced : —T^^Kj 136 men are described as having dwelt there ; but at thej^i,^ time of the survey there were 16 less. The sheriff had■^''®- built on the earl's land 13 houses putting them into the.^ '^ '^^ p \ tax of the old borough. So that it appears, — houses newly^ \ \ J built there, were liable to the charges of the borough, in thesame manner as the old.The land held by the church is entered as partly havingits own soc and sac: — and of the other part, the king had thesoc and sac, — which probably accounts for some of the ecclesiasticalproperty, where the church had soc and sac, orcomplete jurisdiction, being free from the charges of theborough ; and others where the king had the jurisdiction,not being so. A part of this entry also establishes, — ^thatsome mansions had more than one house: — for it is .press entered, that Roger de Bush had in Nottinghamthree mansions, in which are situated 11 houses, renderingAgain it is entered, — ^that William Petrel had 48 housesof merchants, and 12 houses of knights ; and Half de Burnhas 13 houses of knights: in one of them dwells one merchant;and Radulph, the son of Hubert, has 11 houses; inthese dwell three merchants.From these entries it appears, — ^that the merchants wereentered separately from the burgesses ; — ^and so far from themerchant guild being the sole ground of burgess-ship, as hasbeen assumed ; it appears probable, that the merchantswere not burgesses: — for that is the primary significationof the passage : — and at all events, they were not the sameas the burgesses ;■:— nor, from their number, could they be thewhole of them.We have in this place also the same entry as we had inCanterbury,* of many houses being situated in the ditch ofthe borough.Fol.280. This concludes the material part of the separate entry forNottingham. After which follows that of Derby, which statesthe number of burgesses to be the same as we have mentionedSee before, p. 81.DERBY.Domesday.NothingandDerbyshire.F0LSI6.B.before. And in confirmation of our former position establishesthat the ecclesiastics were free from charge — by an entry, that inChe king's demesne there was one church and seven clerkswho held two carucates of land freely. And in Chesteranother church of the king, in which six clerks held nineorgans, also free.The entry of the 40 other burgesses, who are describedas minores, is difficult of explanation, as the expressionoccurs nowhere else, as far as we are aware, in Domesday ;and there is nothing in the context, or the remainder of thestatement, to explain the term. In the return for Yorkshire,under Albert de Lace's manor of Tateshalle, it is said, that hehas there ** l. burgenses minutes ;" but neither in that passage,is there is anything to explain the expression. However, asTateshalle is entered only as a manor, we may assume —that these were not actually burgesses, having the usualprivileges of that class; because they resided in Tateshalle,which does not appear to have been a borough. And as theentry in Derby places the 40 minores separately from theother burgesses, the probability from the whole is, — that theTateshalle " burgenses minores" were not real burgesses, .♦and that the " burgenses minores" of Derby, who are imme- jlately followed by a statement of the number of houses \which were waste, were burgesses, who had been so reducedby poverty, that they were unable to pay their full geld andcustoms, and therefore were not entitled to the privileges ofburgesses.This view of the case is somewhat strengthened, by anentry with respect to the city of York, which speaks of 60 f ol. 298.inhabited mansions, nine less, between great and small ; and400 mansions not inhabited, of which the better pay Id., andothers less ; and 540 manses are so waste, that they altogetherrender nothing. Afterwards, 48 small residences (minutehospitia) are entered. So that it is obvious, — houses paidmore or less, according to the state in which they were : —and in some instances, nothing. The inference thereforewhich we have adopted, appears to be amply justified — that\266 DERBY.^^ o'^^'i^f' from the earliest period of our history, some houses^;^y ^ discharged from contribution to the common stock ;i)^j^ that ground, — ^their occupiers were excluded from themon privileges*Other properties are enumerated under this samebut they do not apply to the present inquiry ; excel]that the Abbot of Barton is stated to have in Derby,possessions with sac and soc; which probably exemptedthem from all borough dues.This concludes all that is material as to Derby,general provisions succeed, — similar to those of thelaws, — and stated to be equally applicable to Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire.After which, follows a singular enumeration of those irliohave sac and soc, — ^toU — and them ; including persons bothecclesiastical and lay.Nothing more relative to Nottinghamshire requires notice,excepting that Newark occurs; and though not described asFoL288. B. a borough, the Bishop Remigius is said to have there in hisdemesne, 56 burgesses.Retort is also named once or twice, but not as a borough.Besides these, — there is no further mention, either of anyborough, or burgesses.RUTLANDSHIRE.Foi.293, B. The short entry of Rutlandshire, also, speaks neither ofboroughs, nor burgesses. Nor does there appear ever tohave been a borough in this county.But as it is followed by seven blank pages, it may havebeen left in some degree imperfect, which would account forits extraordinary brevity.YORK. 267^9 ecEcDomeacUy.Doo :-.ndedr:YORKSHIRE."1°^ YORK.■einhr^ . In Yorkshire there were 14 Parliamentary Boroughs — PYork — Hull — ELnaresborough — Scarborough — Ripon —^ ^ Richmond — Hedon — Pontefract — Marlborough — Boroughsbridge— Thirst— Beverley— North Atherton— Malton. Ofifc these none are described as boroughs, nor are the burgessesmentioned, excepting those of York. Of that place there^^' is a long and minute entry, separate from the rest of theI*"* county, which it precedes.It is described as a city, and its citizens occur once or|B^- twice. The burgesses are more commonly spoken of, paris'circularly as joining in making the return.^' It is said that there are six shires besides the archbishops.These, however, could not mean shires in the sense in which'^•^* that word is now used. In fact "shire" was only thei^ Saxon term for division, or district; and was, in someinstances, applied to that over which the bishop or aldermanpresided ; or even the priest : — for, before the term " parish''was adopted, the expression in use among the Saxons was,the fcjiiFt-shire, or district over which the priest receivedthe confessions of his flock. These " shires," therefore,were doubtless— districts or divisions of the city.A house within the castle, — the residences of the canons, —and of four judges,* seem to be spoken of as possessing pecu- Fol. 298.liar privileges. The bishop is described as having the fullcustom of his shire. To the varying grades of houses — thedifferent rents of some — and the entire exemption from paymentof others — ^we have before adverted in the entry ofDerby. The burgesses residing in the city are expresslyreferred to. Houses in the ditch of the city are also menthefour judges are, in all probability, in conformity with the provision inthe Laws of William the Conqueror, which we hav before staled.U-'{.' • '268 YORK.Domesday. tioned ; and, as some guide to the dimensions of the man-yorkshire,sons, we ought to note, that seven small ones are spokenof as containing 60 feet in breadth. A house is alsodescribed as taken into the castle.This appears to be all that is material in the entry concerningthe city. At the close of it however, it is added — thatthe earl has altogether nothing in the king's demesne manors ;nor the king in the manors of the earl : except what belongsto spirituality, which appertains to the archbishop.There is also a reference to laws, — similar to those of theSaxons, — which, in this entry, as well as in others, seem tobe cited for the purpose of showing what fines, forfeitures,amercements, or reliefs, were due to the king.In the subsequent entry of the county of York, and itsridings, there is nothing requiring particular observation..-'••*LINCOLNSHIRE.LINCOLN, Stamped,Graham, LEEDS.In the county of Lincoln there were five ParliamentaryBoroughs : — Lincoln — Ghrantham — Stamford — great Grimsbyand Boston.Of these Lincoln and Stamford alone are mentioned asFol.336. boroughs. Of Graham, 111 burgesses; and of Leeds, 80occur ; and they are said to have existed in the time of KingEdward. In Torches eyj 2 13 are stated to have all the samecustoms as those of Lincoln. Moreover, whoever had amansion in the same town, gave neither toll nor custom goingin or coming out. And if either of the burgesses wished to^ I go elsewhere, and sell his house, he might do it. At the"^^' j time of the survey there were 112 burgesses dwelling teres\ and 111 mansions waste.The entries of Lincoln — Stamford — and Torches — allprecede the survey of the county and the king's lands.LINCOLN. 269Lincoln is described as a dty ; and it is stated that there oome^y,were, in the time of King Edward. 970 inhabited mansions, Lincolnshire.but that number is computed in English 100 for 120. Therewere also in the same city 12 lags men, having sac and soc.Fourteen persons (who seem to have been Saxons) are statedto have toll and them ; and now there are as many menhaving soc and sac: — their names being all mentioned.Many individuals are described as having mansions in thecity : — one as having his hall quit of all customs ; — anotheras having his hall ; — and one as having a mansion withoutthe hall, whereof he has land gable. The manse of anotheris described as quit of all custom. A priest is said to havea manse with soc and sac ; and Gilbert de Grand the same,and one manse quit of all custom. Earl Hugh, and Rogerde Bush,— each a manse with soc and sac. The CountessJudith, one manse without soc and sac. Remigius, thebishop, hath a little manse, with soc and sac, and toll andthem. And upon this and other manses nothing is paid, exceptthe geld of the king, which they give with the burgesses.Of three superior manses, there is one quit of all things ; buttwo are in geld with the burgesses.Of the manses which in the time of King Edward wereinhabited, there are now waste 200 — English number, 1240;*and in the same numbering, 760 are now inhabited.The under-written do not give geld as they ought : — ^theirnames are then enumerated.Of the waste manses destroyed on account of the castle,there were 166 : — the remaining 74 were waste without thebounds of the castle ; not on account of the oppression ofthe sheriffs and the ministers, but on account of misfortune — •poverty — and burning by fire.Reference is again made to the provisions of the Saxonlaws.Three burgesses in Lincoln are stated to belong to themanor of Stone.This closes the entries relative to the city of Lincoln ;upon which, after our former comments, it is unnecessary♦ Sic orig.270 STAMFORD.Domesday. ^^ make any further observation except, that the burgesses^shfre °" are twice expressly spoken of, as paying the geld.STAMFORD.Stamford — ^which in the time of King Alfred, was one ofthe five boroughs into which the Danes were distributed — isdescribed as having consisted, in the time of King Edward ,of 12 hundreds and a half. These seem afterwards to havebeen converted into six wards : — five in Lincolnshire and sips.in Northamptonshire, which is upon the other side of thebridge. The survey here speaks again of houses being laidwaste, on account of the castle. From which — andthe numerousentries we have before quoted, describing the profits ofthe borough, as reduced by the building of the castle — ^notonly is our position confirmed, that the castles were separatefrom the boroughs : — but it seems also certain, that, generallyspeaking, — the boroughs existed before the castles.The 12 lage men, who were also mentioned in the entry ofLincoln, again occur in this. These were a class of persons,which we have seen, were recognized in the laws of KingEdward the Confessor, and in the Senatus Consulted deMonticello Wallace. As their number was 12,-— correspondingwith the 12 judges of Chester, — there seems no reason todoubt, that they were the jury of the borough ; and as such,were entitled to considerable privileges and exemptions.They appear however in Stamford, to be reduced to nine : —a variation which, in the early periods of our law, is notaltogether unusual, with respect to the jury ; and does notmilitate against the suggestion we have made, of their formingthat body. They appear with the burgesses to have possesseda considerable quantity of land.We find no traces of any decisions respecting the municipalrights of Stamford ; but the burgesses are clearly defined byparliamentary decisions.This place returned members to Parliament, from the 26thof Edward L; with some intermissions in the reigns ofEdward IL and Edward III.: — and a considerable intervalbefore the reign of Edward IV.STAMFORD. 271A market was granted to the men of Stamford in the 14th Domwaay.of Henry III. Lincoln^ Shire.In the 4l8t year of that reign, another charter was granted 1230.to the burgesses of Stamford, as to their debts and pledges ; islandtheir not being answerable for their servants. If they diedintestate, the king was not to have their goods and chattels,but their heirs.Stamford returned members to Parliament again, in the U72.12th of Edward IV.In the 16th year of that reign, the king, in consideration *^''^-of the affection he bore the borough, and to Robert Hassan,alderman, and the burgesses commorant there, granted acharter to the alderman, burgesses, and their successors,that they might hold sessions — have a gaol — ^and return ofWilts like the sheriff — with a non-intermittent clause, excludinghim from interference.The grant of the sessions was probably to enable them totry offences within the borough, — the statute of the 1st ofEdward IV. having taken away, from the Court Leet, thepower of trial.In 1660, upon the Restoration, the return for Stamford was ,„.\^',disputed. It appears to have been made by the alderman, ->as he was called before the House, to amend it according tothe decision of the committee.In the following year, the merits of the election were re- Importedto the House, by Mr. Serjeant Charlton ; who stated,that the question was — ^whether every freeman had a right tovote, or only such freemen as paid scot and lot. It wasdecided, that the latter only had the right.This determination, in words imports to be limited onlyto the freemen ; but if taken in its comprehensive meaning,according to the common law, it would at that time haveincluded all the inhabitants; for the distinction of villainagehad ceased, — and all were free. But, if the decision werethen intended to be limited, — according to the usage offonder periods, — to those who were free by birth or servitude,or who were proved to be so ; it ought, afterwards, whenthose distinctions became altogether obsolete, to have been272 STAMFORD.J>o"g«^y- applied, to all the inhabitants paying scot and lot. And »Lincoln the litigant parties, and a committee of the House of Coib- tmons, seem to have considered in 1736; for at that tiixiea j1735. I9 Geo. il. report was made, respecting the right of election at Stamford; by which it appears, — the committee and all partiesassumed, — ^that every person being an inhabitant, and payingscot and lot, had a right to TOte : — the only question 1>eizi^^whether the right was limited to householders or not. Satthe committee resolved, and the House concurred in thatresolution, — ^that the right was in the inhabitants p€iyiM§scot and lot,*Here, therefore, we have another instance of one of themost ancient boroughs, — where the possessors of land hadgreat privileges — ^in which it is said, that borough Englishprevailed — ^which returned members to Parliament from theearliest time — where there was a corporation — and freemenwere recognised and exercised rights, — ^yet, eventually, it isdetermined, — that the real burgesses are the inhabitantspaying scot and lot.ESSEX.Colchester, HALDOK.In the entry of the king's lands in this county, the liberihomines and free women are repeatedly mentioned — " liberihomines tenentes :" — ^and " liber homo sub rege.*'The villains also frequently occur ; and in one instance, aman, who is described as s, freeman of half a hide in KingEdward's time, is said to be now one of the villains, and tobe reckoned amongst the villains.Socmen also are spoken of — and the reeves or prepositiongenerally : particularly the reeve or prsepositus of the king.The census also is found occasionally. One boroughonly is mentioned amongst the king's lands, namely,Maldon.22 Mourn. p. 615.A'Maldon-COLCHESTER. 273Domesday.MALDON. Essex.Of Maldon is said, 'ein the same hundred (Maldon) theking has 180 houses j which the burgesses holdJ*^Another strong corroborative proof, that the burgessesere the actual occupiers or householders.It is then added, " there are 18 houses waste, of which^' 15 held half a hide and 21 acres, and the other men do^^ not hold more than their houses in the boroughMansions and their inhabitants are also mentioned in thesurvey of the county at large. And tenentes and milites arerecorded in other parts by themselves.Colchester.The entity as to Colchester is thus : — " In Colchester the** bishop (of London) has 14 houses, and four acres, not rene*during custom, except «co^, and that not to the bishop."It is described as a borough, and it is stated — " in Col Foi. 104.*' Chester the bishop has 14 houses."Under the manor of Ruenhale there is an entry of oneburgess of Colchester.The burgesses are said to have claimed five hides in Lux Fol. 104.enhen to the custom and scot of the city ; and the followingare the hinges burgesses, and render custom. After which294 names succeed, with their custom ; as well as the customof 401 houses, which they hold.Fifteen other burgesses are also mentioned, and the custom Foi. 106.rendered by each seems to have been a personal tax ; forit is said, they rendered '' de suis captious." Some landpaid no custom ; — of some the burgesses rendered custom inthe time of King Edward ; but not now, except the custom** de suis captious," or poll tax. Other houses, their ownersand occupiers, and two other burgesses, are spoken of.The common of the burgesses is described as containingfourscore acres of land, and about the wall eight perch, ofthe whole of which, by the year, the burgesses have 60s.for the service of the king, if need be ; but if not, it is dividedin common. It is stated a custom exists, that every yearVOL. I. • T274 MALDON.Domwdfty. fj^^ royal burgesses render two marks of silver, whichEssex. long to the firm of the king ; besides this firm every houseby the year 6d. which was rendered for the support of theking's soldiers, or for expeditions by land and sea, and thisis not at firm.This entry of Colchester requires no further observation,beyond those we have already made on other entries, exceptingthat we should remark the long enumeration of theburgesses and their houses, and the distinct connection apparentbetween them,Foi. 107. We are unable to draw any important inference frontthe expression " commune burgensium," or the division ofthe profits in common ; although other authors have muchrelied upon these and similar terms, as giving birth to someundefined notion of community or corporate privilege : — aninference, however, altogether unjustified ; because no personcould doubt, but that in all the boroughs, whether incorporatedor not, there was a common stock f or the support ofthe walls, roads and bridges, and the maintenance of thepoor.The general history of Colchester we shall postpone untilanother period.MALDON.The immediate connection between the burgesses and thehouses is also observable in the entries for Mcddon : where' . « the 180 occupied by these burgesses are mentioned, and itis added ** they held nothing but their houses."Harwich is not described as a borough in the survey ofthis county.Before we quit this return, we should observe, in confirmationof the position we have already suggested, that thehouses and burgesses entered as belonging to differentmanors, were situated in the boroughs, though they were heldof the manor, and accounted to it — that we have a strikinginstance of this in Essex, where seven houses in Londonare stated as belonging to the manor of Tunic, and includedin its firm.NORWICH. 275Domesday.NORFOLK.NORWICH, YARMOUTH)Thetford.In this county there were five parliamentary boroughs, Norwich— yarmouth — thetford — Lynn Regis — Castle Rising.Of these, only three are mentioned as boroughs in Domesday,Norwich — Yarmouth — and Thetford ; neither of themoccur, as in former cases, before the general entry of thecounty, which begins with the king's lands. Amongst Fol. 114.which, in Heinestede Hundred, it is entered, ** In Framingand Intreussa two burgesses of Norwich hold two acresof land." These burgesses clearly lived in Norwich ; andheld land only in these manors, without houses.HUNDRED OF NORWICH.In Norwich there were, in the time of King Edward, F0I.116.1320 burgesses of whom one, named Edstan, so belongedto the king, that he could not recede nor do homage withouthis license: — he had 18 acres of land, 12 meadows,and two churches in the borough, and the sixth part of athird — ^and to one church belonged one house in the borough,and six acres of meadow, — this Roger Bigot held of the giftof the king.Of 1238, the king and the earl had soc and sac, and custom;over 60, Stigand had soc and sac, and commendation;over 32, Harold had sac and soc, and commendation —of whom one was so in demesne that he could not recedenor do homage without his license.The burgesses held 15 churches, to which belonged, in freealms, 181 acres of land and meadow ; and in the time ofKing Edward, 12 burgesses held the church of the HolyTrinity — snow the bishop, of the gift of the king.There are in the borough 665 English burgesses, andt2*276 NORWICH.Domesday, ^^gy render customs ; and 480 bordarii who, on account ^Norfolk, their poverty y render none.In that land which Stigand held in the time of KingEdward, there now remain of the former burgesses 39, —and in the same land there are 9 mansions empty.In that of which Harold had the soc, there are 16 burgesses,and 17 mansions vacant, which are in the occupationof the castle.There are vacant 190 mansions, which are in the soc of theking and the earl — and 81 in the occupation of the castle.Foi. 117. In the borough there are still 50 houses of which the kinghas not his custom. There then follows a list of 50 persons,describing their occupations, and how many houses theyheld.Of the burgesses who dwelt in the borough of Norwich, 22have departed and dwell in Eccles, the town of the Abbotof St. Edmund's — and six in Hamilcar hundred, who hctcerenounced the borough.These flying, and the others remaining, are altogetherwaste : partly by the forfeiture of Roger, the earl — partlyby fire-partly by the gelt of the king — and partly byLateran.Foi. 118. There is also an entry of the land of the burgesses.The Frenchmen of Norwich. — In the new borough, 36burgesses and six English; and, from the annual custom,each paid \d. on account of the forfeiture. Of the wholeof this, the king had two parts, and the earl the third.Now 41 French burgesses in the demesne of the king andthe earl — and Roger Bigot has 60 — and Radulph de Bella-sago,14 — Hermes, eight — Robert, the archer, five — fuller,the man of the abbot, one — Isaac, one — ^md RadulphWolf-face, one — and in the (pistrino) bakehouse of the earl,three.Robert Blunt and Wiser, one mansion waste.All this land of the burgesses was in the demesne of EarlRadulph, and he granted it to the king, in common tomake a borough between him and the king, as the sheriffwitnesses.Yarmouth-THETFORD. 277All these lands, as well of the knights as the burgesses, Po'^^'^^y-render their custom to the king. Norfolk.There is also m the new borough a certain church, whichthe Earl Radulph made and gave to his chaplain.YARMOUTH.The entry of Yarmouth is as follows. focusYarmouth is in the Hundred of Flee ; King Edward held ^it ; and there were always 70 burgesses.It was then worth, with two parts of the soc of threehundreds, 18Z. numbered ; and the part of the earl, 92. numbered.Now, the two parts of the king, \ll. \Qs, andAd. sterling; and the part of the earl, 82. sterling. Thesheriff has 4/. and one male hawk.The burgesses give these 4/. of income gratis, and fromfriendship.THETFORD.In the entry of Thetford five burgesses are mentioned, andtwo mansions are stated to be vacant.But in the borough there were 943 burgesses in the timeof King Edward.The king has all custom.Of these men, there were 36 so in the demesne of the king,that they could not be the men of any one, without thelicense of the king.All the others could be the men of any one; but neverthelessthe custom of the king always remained, besides heriot.Now there are 720 burgesses; and 224 mansions are Fol. ii.vacant. Of them, 21 burgesses have six carucates, and 60acres, which they hold of the king, and were in the soc ofSt. Edmund. Besides this, two burgesses have one mill.In the boroughs the Abbot of St. Edmund's has onechurch and one house free. The Abbot of Ely, three churchesand one house free, and two mansions, and by custom theywere in one house. The bishop, 20 houses free, and onemill, and half a church. Roger Bigot, one house free, andone monastry, and two bordarii at the monastic.278 THETFORD.— YARMOUTH.—NORWICH.^"^^y- In this entry of Thetford, the vacant homes in theNorfolk, of King William added to the number of the hurgestOymake up the whole number in the time of King Edward,^^ J y^ with the addition of one, which probably was from aII/ y house having been built, as we see was the case at NofwicIlThis affords another decisive instance to establish that theburgesses were the householders.As a small number only of them appear to have heldland, tenure could not have been the qualification of allburgesses. The same 21 who held the land were in thethe soc of St. Edmund's, which would also native thatthe soc had any thing to do with bui^ess ship — ^becauseotherwise all the burgesses would have been in the soc;and it would be a strange anomaly, that holding land inthe soc of St. Edmund's should make the tenants burgessesof Norwich.We should in conclusion observe, that the freemen, the'' liberi homines," are mentioned throughout this return,amounting to 4277./ i From the entry of Yarmouth also, it is clear, that soc and^ sac, were more particularly connected with tenure, andnot with the character of burgesses — because all the 1320were burgesses ; but there are only 60 and 32 over whomparticular individuals had soc and sac. Therefore, as theother burgesses were not so circumstanced, this could notbe a necessary qualification common to all the burgesses.Nor did the fact of being in the sac and soc of anothermanor or land, interfere with their rights; for some of themwere so, and some not: — and there were sons, as well withoutthe boroughs, as within.From the entry of Norwich it also appears, that tenurewas not an essential part of the qualification of a burgess;for the holding of a part only of the burgesses is mentioned,which could not, therefore, be the common qualification.Had it been so, it would have been stated that all theburgesses held land : — but the rest do not appear to haveany such possession independently of their houses.As it has thus been shown, that the qualification of theSUFFOLK.IPSWICH, Munich,SUDBURY, EYB.In this county there were seven parliamentary boroughs,Ipswich — Bury St. Edmund's — Sudbury — Dunwich — oxfordmarlborough — Eye.Of these, only the first is mentioned in Domesday as aborough.The burgesses of Sudbury — Dunwich — ^and Eye — occur.No entry precedes the general return for the county, whichcommences with the Terra Regis.\VNORWICH. 279burgesses neither consisted in the jurisdiction which the lords PQ"^»^y-had OTcr them, nor in their tenure under their lords — so it Norfolk.appears also, that the payment of custom was at least one y \of their characteristics ; and that the bordarii, on account of . ^ ^their poverty, rendered no custom. This, therefore, was oneof the facts at least which denoted the burgesses. nTheir number corresponding with that of the houses, afterdeducting the vacant mansions, is also a striking circumstance,further confirming the conclusion before drawnfrom the entries of Huntingdon, Northampton, Colchester,Maldon, Thetford, in the same lands, and other places —that the burgesses were the inhabitant householders; andparticularly that part of the entry of Norwich which speaksof the burgesses, who before dwelling in Norwich had removedto Eccles, and had renounced the borough.Throughout the enumeration of the houses of Yarmouth, "^the domes are distinguished from the manures : the latterappearing sometimes to be land with a house upon it, andat others land where a house, now waste or vacant, had stood ;the former was probably in all cases an inhabited houses/280 IPSWICH.Domesday.Suffolk. IPSWICH.The entries relating to Ipswich are as follow :Fol. 289. In the borough of Ipswich Stigand had two burgesses inthe time of King Edward, with soc and sac, and the kinghad the custom: since, they are dead, and the king hascustom and soc and sac.Foi. 290. Of half the hundred of Ipswich — of that land \2 freemendwelling elsewhere upon their own land, always held ^acres, to the service and custom of the king, and of theborough.Two burgesses appertained to a grange near the borough,which, in the Confessor's time, had belonged to QueenEdith.In the borough, there were, in the time of King Edward,538 burgesses rendering custom to the king, and they had40 acres of land. Now, there are 110 burgesses renderingcustom ; — and 100 poor burgesses,* who only paid Id. perhead. In the time of King Edward, 328 mansions werewaste, which spotted (scottabant) to the gelt of the king.Fol. 304. Robert Malett has in the borough, one burgess, whomhis ancestor had. The king has his custom.Fol. 314. Of the manor of Plegeforda, one burgess belonged toRobert Malett.Fol. 393, B. To the church of St. Peter, in Ipswich, belonged five burgesses.Fol. 393. Richard, son of Earl Gilbert, had 13.Fol. 402. In the time of King Edward, 41 burgesses had belongedto Robert Fitz Where, the commendation of 26 of whomwas still in his son Stein, of Essex, — the others were deadat the time of the survey ; but they had soc and sac, andthe king had the other customs.Fol. 421, B. Roger de Ramis held St. George's Church, in Ipswich,with four burgesses.Fol. 438. Norman, the sheriff, had two burgesses — one in pledge,and the other for debt ; but the king has his custom.Fol. 446. Tjjg gQj^ Qf Rolf, a burgess of Ipswich, is mentioned amongthe lands of the Vavasor in Suffolk.Burgenses minores. See before, Derby and York.SUDBURY.-DUNWICH.— EYE. 281Domesday.SUDBURY.Suffolk.The entry of Sudbury describes it as belonging to the foi. 886, b.Icing : 56 burgesses are mentioned as in demesne.This town had a market and moneyers.In the Essex survey, in the manor of Wasted, the fol ^©i- ^. b.lowing entry occurs :In Sudbury, five burgesses, holding two acres.Two bordarii and 24 foreigners paid rent to the manor. Foi. 3ii.In the Confessor's time, there had been 120 burgesses.At the survey, there were 236, besides 178 paupers homines.Munich.Eighty burgesses of Dunwich were attached to the manor Folsh.b.of Alneteme, belonging to the abbey of Ely.EYE.Edric held Lege. There were 12 plough lands in the time Folsw.b.of King Edward. Now Robert holds it in demesne. Nowthere is one market, and one park. And in the market dwell25 burgesses. To this manor there belonged 48 socmen, whohad 121 acres of land. Of these socmen there were 37 indemesne, or the lord's vassals.The entry of Ipswich sain confirms the identity of the 'burgesses with their houses ; and establishes the point, thatthose only who paid the full custom of the place, — or inother words, the scot and lot, — were entitled to all theprivileges of burgesses: — whilst the poorer classes wereexcluded. There were 538 burgesses in the time of KingEdward, all of whom paid custom to the king ; but at the /period of the survey, 328 mansions are stated to be wasted,which in King Edward's time spotted (scottabant) to the geltof the king ; and 100 burgesses were poor, and only paid \d.n ^per head. These wasted houses, the poor burgesses, and the110 who paid custom at the time of the survey, make up the •538; and establishes, that the number of burgesses was .reduced to the extent of the mansions which were vacant, >and of those who were so poor as not to be able to pay/IPSWICH.^ /C>A-\I■ u\DoiDCTday. Xjjg j^jj custom,— OF scot, — alluded to in the laws of WilliamSuffolk, the Conqueror. That such a payment, and under that nsuneywas made by the burgesses of Ipswich, is apparent from theuse of the expression in this passage, that these mansic»isbefore spotted to the geld of the king.It is unnecessary here further to insist upon the point,that many of these burgesses held under other manors.But it should be remarked, that those who held land inIpswich, but dwelt elsewhere are not called burgesses, butfreemen — ^that is, persons oifree condition, as the holding* oftheir own land indicated; but not burgesses, because theywere not residing there, or in the simple language of thattime, freemen of, or belonging tOy the borough. Thus establishingboth points, — of freedom and residence ; that beinga freeman was not alone sufficient to make a burgess, unless>. he also belonged to, or resided in, the borough.In the entry of Dtmwich, the 178 poor men are expresslydistinguished from the 236 burgesses.-*^tn the return of the manor of Eye, 26 burgesses are mentionedas dwelling in the market : which Brady, — anxious atall times to extract an inference supporting his doctrine, thatburgess-ship was connected with trade, translated thus, —to the market belong 26 burgesses** — for which thereseems to be no authority, either in the context, or the termsused. The words are '' in mercator manent xxv. burgessesThe expressions usually adopted in Domesday, as descriptiveof that which belonged or appertained to any thing, arepertinent" — ** jacent" — &c. followed with the dative case.Here the preposition " in" is used with the verb " manette*'which throughout Domesday is applied to describe dwelling,or residence. — sand as there appears nothing in any otherpart of the survey to justify the turn which Brady gave tothe expression, or the position which it would appear hewished to maintain, we feel justified in rejecting it; and inadopting the translation we have given above.We have now closed our extracts from this ancient andimportant record ; and in conclusion must observe, — ^that■^1CONCLUSION OF DOMESDAY. , 283there is no mention of, nor allusion to any corporation: — .|WUliaml.neither any thing to show that business-ship depended' 1066.upon ancient demesne, or tenure of any description: — but \the contrary. The frequent mention oi^^free msii^ through \ ^; /-out the returns for the counties, whilst they are rarelyreferred to in those of boroughs, is decisive to show, that at ^ rthis period, as in the Saxon sera, the term ^^free man** was , \^not descriptive of any person belonging to a corporation,but referred to that considerable class of the community, thefree inhabitants who were spread, more or less, all over thecountry ; and appear to have increased considerably at thetime of the survey ; as they did still more in the reign of KingJohn. <Of the 34 counties included in Domesday, the ** Liberi ihomines* are expressly mentioned by name in 14 : and theirfrigate number amounts to 10,067. In some, they arenumerous; in others, but few. In the remaining 20 counties,not only are " free women" mentioned — ^which is decisive toshow, that it was descriptive of free condition, and not ofany corporate privilege— but also many persons of free conditionare designated by other names, as " soc men," " allodial,"" censures," " denarii." The soc men being probablythose free men, who held free lands by purchase orotherwise : — the allodial those who held free lands, whichthey received by inheritance: — the censures, and appellatetions of that description, those free men, who paid the taxesor cense. One or other of these names occurring in all thecounties, with the exception of those in the south and west :as Surrey and Sussex, Wiltshire, Somersetshire, Devonshireand Cornwall.

We proceed now to the few other records which thescanty materials of this reign afford for the illustration ofour municipal institutions.LONDON.It is a remarkable circumstance, that a place of such greatimportance as London should not be entered in Domesday : —and that no return should be made of the proprietors or possessionswithin it.Without bewildering ourselves in the early traditionaryaccounts of this place, it is sufficient to know, that as far backas authentic history extends, London is described as a placeof the greatest eminence in the country. Tacitus mentionsit by the name of Concilium ;* and its Saxon nameappears to have been ** LoTidon-bj/riff :^' importing that itwas at that time a borough : as Canterbury was also calledCanttDara-'byrig, or the Borough of the Men of Kent.800. Lombards says, that as early as Ad. 800, it was governedhy 2L port-reeve or a reeve of the towns839. About the year 839, London was destroyed and burnt bythe Danes; but was subsequently restored and rendered886. habitable by Alfred J about the year 886 ; when he gave thecustody of it to his son-in-law, Ethelred, Earl of Mercia ;and appointed a person to be alderman over all Londoner^^- It appears to have been walled in the year 994. As Williamof Salisbury says, that about that year ** the Lonedonors shut up their gates, and defended their king,^* Ethelred, within their walls, against the Danes.'*||1014. In the encomium of Emma, daughter of Richard, Dukeof normandy, and Queen of England, it is said, ** that Canuteordered the city of London" — which is described as the metropolisof the land, — " to be besieged, because the chief menof the land had fled there, and part of the army, with thegreatest portion pf the common people, as the city wasmost populousness[• Vide Tac. t Lamb. Top. Diet. t Stow, 8. j Slow, 8.II Sax. Chron. 886. 1 Stow, 15.LONDON. 285When Edmund Ironside waa king of the Saxons, Canute ^016.the Dane brought his army to the west part of the bridge ;and cast a trench about the city of London; and attemptedto win it by assault: but the citizens repulsed him, and drove Isti.him from their walls.*To evince the great importance of this city shortly afterthat time, it may be observed, that London is described inthe Laws of Edward the Confessor, as ^' the head of thekingdom and the laws." And the court of the king is theredirected to be held in the hustings on Monday in every week.Earl Goodwin, in 1052, sailed with his navy by the south *^^*end of the bridge, and so attacked the walls of the city.fAfter William, Duke of Normandy, had landed in Eng-^n^ml.land, and defeated' and killed Harold, he marched towardsLondon, and coming to the south side of the river, nearSouthwark, he proceeded along that side of the Thames till»he came to Wallingford, where he crossed, and then marchedagain towards London on the north. When he approachedthe place, Stigand, Archbishop of Canterbury, with theprincipal persons of the city (principes civitatis, as the historianssay), came out to meet him, and surrendered themselvesand the city to him. Before he entered, he directedsome military defences to be made within it, remaining himself,with his army, in the suburbs. §Although in this, and some of the preceding extracts, ] 'London is called a city, yet it does not necessarily followthat it was so named at that time : — because the histories,from which we have derived our information were written longsubsequently to that period ; and in the charter which Williamgranted to London, soon after he had obtained possession ofit, (the original of which is said to be still extant in thearchives,) there appears to be no mention of it as a city.This charter is addressed to the bishop, port reeve, and allthe burgwara,^ or the inhabitants of the borough of London,French as well as English. Which raises a strong• Stow. 8. t Wilk. 206. 2 Inst. 327. t Stow, 8.See De Geste Gulielmi dunois Normanoruro, p. 144 & 150.f War. Saxon— Men, or Dwellers.286 LONDON.William I. inference that the burgesses included all the inhabitants..1066. Its principal object is to recognise the freedom of the tom,and the free condition of its inhabitants: — ^which is effectuallydone by confirming to them the rights peculiar to yr^^men: —Of those, one the most important, was, that they were to belaw-worthy, or Gales homines: that is, persons entitled to theprotection of the law as freemen: and, consequently, subjectalso to all the obligations of it. Forming the distinguishingcharacteristic between those who were of freecondition, and those who, being servi, or of the servile class,were subject entirely to the controul of their lords; andwere neither entitled to privileges — ^nor subject to duties, —distinct from their obligations to their immediate thanes orsuperiors. The charter, therefore, declares the inhabitantsof London to be law-worthy, and recognises them as suchin the days of Kmg Edward.It has already been seen, from the Saxon Laws, that theconsequence of individuals being treated as " law-worthy,"was, that they were bound to the law within their ownparticular district, and were there pledged to the due performanceof all their public functions — their allegiance tothe king — ^and their duty of keeping and maintaining hispeace.As another distinguishing feature ot freemen, the kingrecognises their free right of inheritance. A right, which, fromthe very nature of their condition, the servi and villany couldnot enjoy: — ^for, they could neither have land, nor goods, oftheir own : — and, consequently, could have nothing for theirchildren to inherit. On the contrary, the very essence ofthe character of a freeman was, that he might hold andenjoy his own firee tenement. It appears to have been oneof the earliest provisions of the social compact ; as foundin almost every state ; and undoubtedly communicated to usfrom all our ancestors — ^as well the Romans, as the northerninvaders, — that he who possessed property should have theright of transmitting it to his heirs: and that they, as freepersons, being born of free parents, should have the powerof inheriting from their fathers. Therefore, the king grants/•tte*LONDON. 287to the free inhabitants of London, that "every child should William.be bis father's heir." 1066.The charter then proceeds — ^in return for the allegiance .n^hich the freemen swore to the king — to give them theprotection which the king owed to them. And consequentlyhe says, "he will suffer no person to do them** wrong*It is perfectly in accordance with the simplicity of theages to which we are alluding, that privileges so important —extensive — and valuable, — should be contained in the fewwords of the following charter.William the king, friendly salutes William thebishop, and Godfrey the port reeve, and all the burgesseswithin London, both French and English. AndI declare, that I grant you to be all law-worthy,* as** you were in the days of King Edward; and I grant,*' that every child shall be his father's her, after hisfather's days. And I will not suffer any person todoyou wrong. God preserve you."This charter is not among the charts antiques in theTower of London : — but the citizens of London are said tohave it in their possession.The port reeve is the king's officer, or reeve of the town(Saxonic^ — Porte), as the sheriff is the reeve of the king forthe shire.Fabian, in his chronicle, mentions a very ancient register,or Dom^Boc, which, in his time, was preserved with theutmost veneration in the archives of the city of London : — andin which the names of the portgereves, together with thelaws and customs of that city, were recorded. This hesays was not written on a roll, but consisted of a numberof leaves bound up together in the form of a booksKing William also granted another charter to the citizensThe translation adopted above, that the inhabitants were to be " law-worthy,"is questioned by Mr. Hardy, who is likely to be accurate on this as well as othersubjects ; but still, considering the nature of the Saxon and Norman laws, it seemsmost probable that this, or a similar meaning, should be the real interpretation ofthe charter.t See Introduction to AylofiTs Calendar of Charters.288 LONDON.William I, of London, which requires explanation, and may afford some1066. inferences to illustrate our general subject. It contains agrant of land to the people of London, and is therefore properlyaddressed to the bishop, — that he may claim no ecclesiasticaljurisdiction or dominion over it, or at least mayregulate his claims subserviently to the king's charter. It isalso addressed to the sheriff, — ^because he, as the king's officerin the shire, had it not been for this charter, would hairehad to account to the king for the issues of the land. It isaddressed likewise to the thanes of East Saxony, — ^that is, thenobles or barons — that they might not exercise their dominionor lordship over this land, as having been granted bythe king. The charter is made in the most general words tothe "people." And it would be difficult to say, that thisterm could receive any other construction, than that thewhole body of inhabitants subject only to the qualificationswe shall hereafter point out) were the objects of the grant.The following is a copy of the charter : —William the king, friendly salutes William thebishop, and Sweyn the sheriff, and all my thanes (ornobles) in East Saxony, whom I hereby acquaint,that pursuant to an agreement, I have granted tothe people, my servants, the hyde of land at Cyd-destine."Under all these circumstances therefore — ^and consideringthat London is shown by these charters to have been theobject of the bounty and munificence of the crown — it isvery extraordinary that so little mention of it should bemade in Domesday. There is no separate return from it : —and it is now impossible to account positively for this omission.The conjecture seems highly probable, that eithersome separate return was made — or that the king's profitsof London were accounted for through some other channel.Royal dues must have arisen there, and an account ofthem must have been rendered. The difficulty now is toascertain where and how this was done. But even if therewere a separate return for London itself: — it is still extraordinarythat the borough should not be mentioned, andititSAC AND SOC. 289the Burgesses should occur only twice, — and that in the ^^^^*^'"^-survey of Surrey : — where in the king's lands, under Brixtonhundred, 13 burgesses in London are spoken of as appertainingto the manor of Bermondsey. Again, under the landsof the church of Blanche, it is said, there are 19 burgessesin London. These entries, however short, seem stronglyto confirm the inference before drawn from those relatingto many other places ; that persons residing in the boroughwere by their residence burgesses, although they held landsbelonging to distant manors.Before concluding this reign the reader should be informed,that many charters were granted to ecclesiastical bodies byWilliam the Conqueror; — which, although they vnll not tendto show what boroughs were, may enable us to ascertainsome of the privileges which did not constitute tliem^^.,^The charter to the abbey of Evesham granted sdc and soc,*to which such frequent reference is made in Domesday.Many authors have considered that those privileges werecharacteristic of boroughs, and they have been thought toinclude both civil and criminal j jurisdiction. If it were so, theywould probably have given the same rights that boroughsenjoyed : — because places possessing them would then havehad a perfect jurisdiction within themselves, and the sheriffwould have had no reason to interfere with them. But thefact is, as (many of the passages we have quoted fromDomesday demonstrate,) that this liberty gave only that civiljurisdiction which the lord had over his tenants; extendingonly to questions connected with the holding of their lands,and with what are ordinarily called Common Fleas. Thiswas enjoyed with almost every manor, and in modem times,has been called the " Court Baron." But it did not extendto criminal matters. Therefore such manors were subject tothe general interference of the sheriff as to pleas of the crown,which were within his particular jurisdiction at the tom.The duties of the suitors at these respective courts were clearly-distinguishedfrom each other — the latter relating to pleas ofthe crown — the keeping the peace — giving pledges for good♦ 2 Dug. 682.VOL. I. U290 SAC AND SOC.fr^^'"»*"J' behaviour — and binding themselves by oaths of allegiance tothe king and the laws, which was emphatically called ^^ suitToyaly^ as due to the king and his crown. Whereas theservice at the court baron, described by sac and soc, relatedr \ only to suit of court; soc being the liberty of separateand distinct jurisdiction, and sac the privilege of taking\ the issues and profits of the court.Sac and soc alone were, generally speaking, at first onlygranted to the ecclesiastical bodies ; and not the court leet,or exemption from suits of shires and hundreds, as in thecase of Evesham ; and as that place was not then a borough,it decisively proves, contrary to the assumption of Brady,that these were privileges not peculiar to boroughs. On theother hand, some of the possessions of the church were altogetherexempted from the jurisdiction of the sheriff, andhad powers excluding his interference, in the same manneras the charters granted to boroughs ; but as the propertybelonged to ecclesiastical jurisdiction, though the sheriffBeverley, ^as excluded, yet they were not boroughs. Thus Beverleyhad such a charter, but was not made a borough till a muchlater period.A charter was granted by William the Conqueror to theBattle. Abbey of Battle, which became a subject of judicial investigationin the case mentioned in the note."*^ It directed thatthe abbot should have his own court, with full jurisdiction;free from all interference of the bishop, as Christchurch atCanterbury ; and gave sanctuary — freedom from geld andscot — ^hydages — dane-geld — repair of bridges and castles —and from all pleas and suits of shires and hundreds — ^withsac — soc — toll — them — and infangthef. This charter wasconfirmed by Henry I. and succeeding kings.Henry VIII. granted the manor and hundred of Battle toSir Anthony Brown ; with power to hold views of frankpledge,court leet, hundred court, law days, sokes, return ofwrits, cognizance of pleas, and other rights, jurisdictions,powers, liberties, &c., as the late abbot, or any of his predecessors,had held or enjoyed in right of the said abbey.Will.

Pagi, Doug. 188.ABATTLE. 291Under the first grant of William the Conqueror, upon William I.proof in ivhom the manor and hundred by various mesneassignments were then vested — ^that the manor and hundredwere co-extensive — ^that there had been a court regularlyheld within the manor till the year 1744 — ^that by , iimmemorial custom the pedants within the hundred had ^ -^* - 'been returned to serve on juries out of it, and that no preceptshad from-time immemorial been issued by the high ' '\^ j,constable, it was held — after argument of a special case onthe point, and the court having taken time to consider — ^that ikk^ inhabitant of the hundred were still exempt frombeing summoned on juries. Notwithstanding the severalgeneral affirmative statutes subsequently passed, requiringthat aR should serve on juries: — ^and notwithstanding noproof was given of the allowance of this privilege : — norwas Battle ever a corporate town, holding sessions ofgaol delivery, or sessions of the peace: — and althoughthe defendant had been found guilty at the assizes : — thecourt, nevertheless, ordered a verdict of acquittal to be entered.Thus in a case in which no political interests interfered,a franchise, which had its origin in the reign of William theConqueror, was supported in favour of the inhabitantSy forwhose benefit the charter was assumed to be granted : —Notwithstanding it appeared, as far as the evidence went,that the court which was the ground of the exemptionhad ceased for four or five years. It is obvious that thisdistrict, like boroughs and other privileged places havingexempt jurisdictions, was relieved from the burden ofserving upon juries without the hundred, because they performedthat public duty at their own houses, by serving onthe juries within their own district. When, therefore, theyceased to hold their oivn court within the manor — ^whichit seems they had done from 1744 — the ground of their privilegewas at an end, and the privilege itself should haveceased also. But, nevertheless, the court supported it : — andthe presumption is that it is enjoyed to this day.As Christchurch, Canterbury, is above referred to, it shouldu2292 DURHAM.— ROCHESTER.Williaml.be observed, that in 780, there was a charter granted toChristchurch at Canterbury ; which spoke of the head officerof the town, whom it describes — Aldhuni humus civitatispraefectus — a term in all probability borrowed from theRomans.*To further illustrate this period, in which we find but fewdocuments, we shall add two other charters ; establishingwhat privileges were then usually granted to the possessionsof the church.This king, in the first year of his reign, granted, amongstDurham, other charters, one to the convent of Durham, regulating the^^^ election and amotion of the future priors and brethren : — andtaking them and their possessions under his protection, —granted sac and soc,toll and them, infangthef, and their court ;and that they, with their meus should be free of all payments,exactions, rents, tolls, and all customs which belongto the crown.The other charter of this king, grants to the church ofRochester gt.

Dr, Brady says, it wants not probability, though it doesnot manifestly appear, that this king granted large immunitiesto burghs, to secure them to his party, in .orderto protect his usurped crown.:j: But no such charters are nowto be found ; nor is there any trace of them, either by inspector confirmation : — in one or other of which modes, itSee Somner's Canterbury, edit. 1640, p. 363. t 1 Dug. Mon. 29, 6.X Brady, 32.COMMON COUNCIL. 293seems more than probable that all the charters which were ^'^"*°^"-granted can now be traced.This, therefore is one of those gratuitous assumptions,in which historians too readily indulge ; and in which Dr.Brady was, undoubtedly, by no means disinclined to participate.It appears, on the contrary, that during the 13 years ofthis barbarous reign, the king was chiefly occupied in securinghimself from the conspiracies of his opponents: — inacquiring and preserving his Norman possessions ; and instruggles with his barons, and quarrels with Anselm. Wetherefore find, with reference to our present subject ofinquiry, little to arrest our attention. The united testimonyof all historians seems to concur in attributing to this reign,scarcely any alteration in the laws or institutions of thecountry.HENRY I.Henry I., who from the weakness of his title to the *crownwas anxious to ingratiate himself with the people,auspiciously commenced his reign by granting to them aconfirmation of what were supposed to be, the laws ofEdward the Confessor. He began with reciting, that thekingdom had been oppressed with unjust exactions — ^whichit probably was the intention of this charter of liberties toobviate.Considering the importance which has been frequentlyattached to the words ^* common council," gratuitously assumedto have originally described a select part of acorporation, it is not altogether foreign from our subject, forthe purpose of shewing the early use of those terms toremark, that this charter or body of laws was made bythe common council of the barons of the kingdom. The same294 LONDON.Henry I. expression, occurring before in the cases of Northamptonand Leicester"*The king then directs that the church shall be free ; sothat he will neither sell it, nor place it at farm : nor if thearchbishop, bishop, or abbot, are dead, would he accept anything from the lord of the church, nor his men, until asuccessor shall enter upon it. And all bad customs withwhich the kingdom was oppressed, the king abrogated.He established the rights of heirs; who were not toredeem their land, as they had done in the time of hisbrother; but were to pay only their proper reliefs.Payments upon marriages were renounced. Heiresses andwidows were to be protected, and their dowers secured.Moneybags, which was not taken in the time of KingEdward, was renounced.All debts, and other dues payable to the king, arefarmed ; except the fee-farms, and some other matters.And generally the exactions of his father and brother aredisclaimed.The laws of King Edward are frequently mentioned andconfirmed.The lands of certain knights are to be held free of allguilds : — ^which here mean all common payments ; an applicationof the term which should not be forgotten. Thischarter is witnessed by the archbishops, &c., when the kingwas crowned.Linton. After these provisions immediately follows a chartergranted to the citizens of London; probably intended topropitiate that important body towards the new succession.As this charter contains a more minute detail of the libertiesand privileges granted to London, than those which havepreceded it ; and as the rights and usages of the metropoliswill perhaps be found more effectual for the purpose ofillustrating the general subject of our inquiry, as well as thehistories of other particular places ; it may be expedient tostate the substance of it in detail. —It granted Middlesex to the citizens of London and theirVide ante, p. 222.LONDON. 295heirs at the farm of £300 ; and that the citizens might place ^^nr I-whom they would of themselves, to be sheriff, and also oneto be justiciary, for keeping the pleas of the crown,"*^ thatnone other should he justiciary over the same men of London.That the citizens should not plead without the walls for anyplea. That they should be free from scot and lot — dane-geltand of murder : — and none of them should wage battle.If any of the citizens should be impleaded concerning thepleas of the crown, the man of London should dischargehimself by his oath, to be adjudged within the city. No onewas to have lodging assigned him within the walls : nor anyoneof the king's household, nor of any other, have lodgingassigned to him by force. That-all the men of London shouldbe quit and free, with their goods throughout England, andthe ports of the sea — of toll passage lestage, and all othercustoms. That the churches, barons, and citizens should wellandpeaceably have and hold their sokes with all their customs.That the guests who should be lodged in the sokes shouldgive custom to none but to the king, and to him whose soke itshould be, and to his officer whom he should have placed there.That a man of London should not be adjudged in amerciamentsof money, unless for his Were of a hundred shillings — (I speakof the pleas which appertain to money. f) And further, that Sec. i.there should not be miskenning in the hustings, nor in the folc^mote, nor in any other pleas within the city. That the hustingsshould sit once in a week, that is to say, on Monday.That the citizens should have their lands, securities anddebts within the city and without. That the king would dothem right by the law of the city, of the lands concerningwhich they should appeal to him. That if any one took tollor custom of the citizens of London, they should take of theborough or town, where toll or custom was so taken, so muchas the man of London gave for toll, and as he receiveddamage thereby. That all debtors who owed debts to thecitizens of London, should pay them there or else dischargethemselves there that they do not owe them ; but if theySee ali) the Leges Burgorum, chap. 63.t So the originaL296 LONDON.^^"''y ^* would not pay, nor come to clear themselves that they didnot owe them, then the citizens of London to whom the debtsshould be due, might take, in the city of London, the goodsof the borough or tam, or of the county wherein he dwellswho should owe the debt. And that the citizens of Londonshould have their chaces to hunt as well and as fully as theirancestors had, that is to say, in Children, and in Middlesex,and Surrey.This charter produced a striking peculiarity with respectto the city of London, that it had the extensive bailiwick ofMiddlesex united with its own ; — ^which may probably accountfor their afterwards having a varying number of sheriffs ;as in this reign we find they had four — ^in the commencementof the reign of Henry IL, two — and in the 4th of his reign,five."*^ It is also a decisive proof that London was not at that\ time incorporated and that this charter did not incorporateit — nay, even that the doctrine of incorporation, or takingby succession, was not then known. For Middlesex isgranted to the citizens of London, and to their heirs : — notto their successors.Hume. Hume, in his history, takes upon himself to assert, thatthis charter was the first step towards rendering London acorporation ; for which — ^from the nature of the charter, andthe observations we have before made — the reader will observethere is not the slightest foundation ; but it is fromthese, and many other similarly hasty and unfounded assertions,that historians — lawyers — and even the courts — havebeen misled into the assumption of the early existence ofcorporations.As Middlesex was granted to London, it was necessarythat a sheriff for it should be provided; and therefore thecharter proceeds to enable the citizens to choose a sherifffrom themselves: — and also a justiciary for keeping thepleas of the crown : — that is, a person who should presideas judge or steward in the tom or leet. And the grantexcludes all others from exercising those functions.In order that they might have the full benefit of this ex-mad.Fir. Bur. 165 and 166.- LONDON. 297elusive jurisdiction, it is, as a necessary consequence pro Henry I.vide, that they should not plead without the walls. Anthat the sheriff, or other king's officer, might have no groundfor interfering with them, they are discharged from paying tothe king scot or lot — or dane-geld — or fines for murder. Asthey are exempted from other foreign trials, they are releasedfrom trial by battle, and are to be discharged upon theirown oath by judgment in the city. They are expresslyexempted from having guests forced upon them — from demandsof toll — and other similar chaises. They and theirguests are protected in the enjoyment of their sokes or localjurisdictions; and regulations are made for the due holdingof the hustings and fol-mote — the general administrationof the law — with other provisions, giving full effect to the /privileges intended to be granted.Thus we have in this instance of London, a clear and extinctspecimen of the nature, extent, and object of that exclusivejurisdiction, which was by this charter granted tothe metropolis. We shall hereafter see, in this and succeedingreigns, numerous grants to other places, substantiallysimilar in their objects and provisions.In this first step of our inquiry it may be well for thereader to pause, and candidly consider whether it is possiblefor any prejudice or perversion to suggest a doubt, but thatthis charter was granted for the benefit of the persons livingin London — the real inhabitants of the place. And that allwho were capable of enjoying these privileges, and performingthe duties arising from them, were entitled to the enjoymentof the one, and bound to the performance of the other;and that, neither the right nor the duty, could by possibility,considering the nature of the charter, attach to any personnot an inhabitant of the city.The laws of Henry L, in the midst of which the charter to Laws.London is introduced, then proceed to make regulations forthe due and equal administration of justice.In the sixth section, with reference to the present inquiry, Sec. 6.we ought to notice, that the hundreds — the decennas — andthe pledges of the lords, are successively mentioned. The298 LAWS OF HENRY I.^^"^ ^* latter, relating to the small sokeB, ^d exclusive jurisdictionsof the lords, in which they were responsible for their dependents,were in some degree analogous to the decennee, uponthe principle which results from the extracts we have alreadymade from the Saxon laws, with respect to the vicariousresponsibility of the lords : — ^which we shall hereafter findexpressly laid down in Bracton, the Mirror, and the YearBooks.Sec. 7. In the 7th section, amongst those who are to be presentat the pleas of the counties, are classed the hundreds —Sec. 91. the aldermen — and the reeves.The shire-mote is to be held twice, and the hundreds orwapentakes twelve times, in the course of the year.Sec. 8.

A decided is to preside over every ninemen. One of the better men shall preside over the wholehundred, and be called alderman, — ^who is diligently to endeavourto promote the laws of Cod, and the rights of man.From hence — notwithstanding the many conjectures whichhave been needlessly thrown away upon this point — ^we havea clear and distinct definition of the station, duty, and officeAlderman, of an alderman, in which we cannot be mistaken, — andwhich ought to be remembered in the further progress of ourinquiry. Afterwards, the provisions of the Saxon laws, thatevery person above twelve years old, shall be in the hundred,and give his pledges, is repeated. And every lord was togive security for his men to do right. No one was to retainan unknown person or vagrant beyond three days, withoutsecurity: — for which provisions, reference is made to thelaws of Edward the ConfessorsSec. 9.

One of them directs, that a party shall be summonedwhere he is resident with his family ; and the law isreferred to, by which every lord is compelled to hold his Sec. 59.family in pledge.See also sec. 20.300 LAWS OF HENRY I.€^^"''y ^' Provisions are made with respect to those who depart fromSec. 43, their lords without license — and for those who hold of differentlords and who are resiant with the one whose liegesthey are.* He whose resiant and liege any person is and towhom his mandate is due, ought by right to have him topledge against any others.Sec. 46. The frank-pledge in boroughs appears to be referred to,under the term of bui^i lex, — which seems a strong expressionto show, that the court leet and view of frank-pledge, bywhich the law was administered in the borough, exclusive ofthe jurisdiction of the sheriff, were the striking characteristicsof a borough.Sec. 61. The 61st section provides for the assigns, or excuses, fornot attending the county and hundred courts.Sec. 54. Section 54 contains directions for voluntary associationsof persons having a common stock ; and provides, that ifthose who are so associated together, wish to depart fromthe society, they shall bring before witnesses whatever theyhave, to be divided in common ; and if it is necessary, theyshall swear they have no more.From this section it is obvious, that societies having propertyin common existed at that time: — but it is equallyclear, that they were entered into voluntarily, and could bedissolved at will. They do not appear to be designated bythe name of guilds, — and were in no respects like corporations; nor had any connection with boroughs or municipalgovernments.Sec. 56. Ii ^h^ ^^^^ section, reference is made to the men of thelords, who resided in remote manors; of which we havecited many instances from Domesday. And it is provided,that a man of one manor shall not .be obliged by the law togo to plead in another. After which the oath of fidelity issubjoined. From whence it appears, that persons were allowedto reside away from the manors of which they held ;but, that when they did so, they were subject to legal jurisdictiononly in the places where they resided,Vide also sec. 56.LAWS OF HENRY I. 301The seth section relates to homicide in the court of the Henry I.king — the army — borough — or castle. Sec. 80.The syst section relates to the giving king's peace in Sec. 81.drinking. It provides — that, in every drinking, whethergiven, bought, or paid for in common, (cation, vel emotion,vel gildas,) or prepared for any one, — in the first place, letthe peace of God and the Lord be given.This provision is to be accounted for by the habits of thetimes in which it was made : when the peace was preservedat convivial drinking by legal enactments. In the earlycharters granted to London, as well as in those of manyother places, special exemptions from scotale, or contributionfor liquor provided for the king's household, are especiallyintroduced. It may not be without excuse to add,as a proof of the general influence of these laws at that time,and of the traces which have continued of them to thesedays, that the place, the peace of which was protected bysevere penalties in the time of our Saxon ancestors, wascalled " ealahuf ;" or, as the modem term is, " ale house"*For the regulation of which so many modem enactmentshave been made.These laws conclude with a specific enumeration of the Sec. 93,and 94.different forfeits to be made for bodily juries.Henry I., in the third year of his reign, held a council ^^^•at St. Peter's in Westminster. Anselm, the Archbishop ofCanterbury — the Archbishop of York, — ^and other prelatesand abbots were present, as well as the earls and barons.Provisions were then made for the ecclesiastical governmentof the church, to which it is only necessary to allude,not being material to our present researches.Councils also were held in London in 1106 and 1107. In iio«,iio7.the latter of which, regulations were made respecting theinvestiture of churches, and the election of priests.In 1 108, the king directed t hat all burgesses, and all who 1108.dwelt in boroughs, should swear that they would d preserve th eleg al coin, and not consent to its falsified ion.In the same year, the king also granted another charter,• Ll. ifiihel. Tar. de Mor. Germ.302 NEWCASTLE-UPON.TYNE.^g°fy^- directed to the bishop and barons of Worcestershire, thatthe county and hundred courts should sit at the places andtimes at which they sat in the time of King Edward ; andnot otherwise. And that all of the county should attendthere.In the same year a council was held, in which. provisionswere made for the celibacy of the clergy ; and other ecclesiasticalmatters.1116. In 1116, another council was held, at which a greattribute was given to the king ; and it is said that frequentgelds were also paid at that time.Other councils were held during this reign, which do notdemand any comment*The laws of Henry I., though considerably expanded — anddetailed more minutely than those of the Saxons, or Williamthe Conqueror — are still in effect and object the same ; and,therefore, they do not require further illustration, than toobserve that they were clearly of Saxon origin; — as theycontain many Saxon terms ; and they breathe the same spiritI of liberty, and equal justice which characterised the institutionsof our earlier ancestors. Nor can we believe, as assertedby many authors, that either the Conqueror or Hairy I. madesuch changes in our institutions as is generally supposed.The probable explanation seems to be, that the barons ndinferior officers of the king, or others entrusted with the administrationof the laws, neglected those of Edward the Confessor,and allowed them to be disused ; because the chartersboth of William and Henry seem to admit that fact : thosekings, however, seem to have exerted themselves from timeto time to restore them, and to censure their neglect. Wemay rest, therefore, satisfied, that the laws of Edward theConfessor were, at this time, considered of authority ; — ^and,as far as the king could effect it, were practised during hisreign.Newcastle. Henry I. granted certain laws and customs to the burgessesof Newcastle ; in which the reeve is mentioned, andprovisions are made, that any questions moved in the boroughshould be there disposed of, except those which belonged to\INEWCASTLE-UPON-TYNE. 303the crown:* — ^that no burgess should plead without the town ;v Henry I.^and all pleas between burgesses and merchants should be kdetermined within the third flux of the sea. If a burgess had ■a son in his house having his board there he should have thesame liberty as his father : — and if a villain should come to *the borough to dwell there, and should hold land within theborough for a year and a day, without any claim of his lord,he might remain there for any time as a burgess. Foreignersare spoken of: and every burgess might sell his land, and govf^here he would. The burgesses also were exempted fromtrial by battle ; — and their burgages are mentioned — it is alsosaid, the forfeiture of a buigess towards the reeve ought to becommon. Certain exemptions and privileges then follow :and there is a provision respecting the assize of bread andbeer: the forfeiture to the reeve — and for a third fault, theoffender was to be punished by the common council of theburgesses.The provisions as to the villains, seem to be copied fromthe Leges Burgorum of Scotland And we should observe,throughout this document, the marked distinction betweenburgesses^ villains ^ and foreigners: — that the sons of b urgesses being of free c o edition b y birth, were e ntitl ed to thesame privileges as their fathers: — that the houses in theborough were held by burgage tenure : — ^and that some ofthe forfeitures were to be imposed by the common council ofburgesses: — ^which, as we have observed before, means bythe common assent of the burgesses^ and not that it was theact of any select body, as the terms are applied in modemtimes.In this reign there is also a document — De tallio dandy etaccipiendo apud Novem Castrum, tempore Enrich Regis —which after an enumeration of the different articles, and thepayments for them, adds — ^* Persona JBcclesiarum barones etmilites sint quieti de tollonio sue mense, et nullus alius."Things sold unthin and without the town, are distinguished :and the burgesses are mentioned at the close of the document.Ancient Register, Northumberland House.

This king seems to have followed the steps of his brotherin compiling the Domesday Book of Winchester called theWinton Dom Boc ;" and it appears to have been formedupon the oaths of 80 burgesses — no doubt of Winchester.A copy of this record has been recently made fromthe original, and is in the possession of the Society ofAntiquaries.However, notwithstanding it is very minute and particularin the detail of the landed possessions, there is no materialmention of the city or burgesses, illustrative of our presentsubject.There are some few charters of this reign, independentlyof that which we have already quoted, as granted toLondon.One to Beverley f by Tartan, Archbishop of York : — bywhich he granted — ^with the advice of the chapter of Yorkand Beverley, and of his barons — ^to the men of Beverleyall the liberties which those of York had in their city.*He states, moreover, that King Henry had granted to himthe power to do so; and by charter, had confirmed it.The archbishop further willed, that his burgesses of Beverleyshould have their marshes (or guildhall) that theymight there dispense their laws, for the amendment of thewhole town, by the same law of liberty as those of York hadit in their marshes. There was added, a partial grant of toll.And upon particular days, all the burgesses were dischargedfrom the payment of it; and free ingress and egress wasgiven them, within the town and without. They were free oftoll throughout Yorkshire, as those of York ; and amongstthe witnesses to this charter was Thomas, the reeve.It will be seen, therefore, that this grant was made to themen of Beverley ; afterwards called the burg esse ^ as if theterms men of the places and burgesses oftheplacey were, bothin Beverley and York, synonymous.This charter is afterwards confirmed, by one of the king tothe men of Beverley, who are called the burgesses, accordingto the free laws and customs of the burgesses of York ; and• Inspeximus Charter of Henry II.fChester-HUNTINGDON. ' . 305their guild merchant, with their pleas and tolls, and all their Henry I.firee customs, as Tartan had granted to them. From which,it will be observed, as will occur in numerous subsequentinstances, that the grant of the guild merchant is separatefrom that of the privileges of burgesses.Henry I. also granted to his men of Chester and their heirs, Chester,that no one coming to the city should buy or sell but themselvesand their heirs, or by their leave, excepting at marketsand fairs.*It must not be overlooked, that this charter, like that toLondon, is granted to the men of Chester, and their heirs,who are shortly after called the citizensThus in the 22d year of this reign, Ralph, Earl and 1I21.Constable of Chester, granted to all the citizens of Chester,the liberties and customs which they had in the time ofany of his predecessors. And if any citizen should die, hisTwill should be held good, whensoever he should die. Ifany citizens should buy any thing in full day, and beforewitnesses, and a demand should afterwards arise respectingthe purchase, either of a Frenchman or Englishman, whocould disprove it; he who made the purchase should bequit of the king or any of his bailiffs, restoring what hehad bought ; but otherwise, he cannot make satisfaction tothe seller.The charter then concludes with some provisions, whichare immaterial in a general point of view.There are also many other charters granted by this kingto several places.One to Barnstaple, recognizing it as a borough, and granting Banuupie.a fair therein:Another by the same king, to the canons oi Huntingdon, '^o^-that the soke of St. Mary, and their two hides of Norman done*Cross hundred, be so quit of the commonalty and gelds ofthe borough of Huntingdon, sicut comitatus intravit inde indiratiocinamentum adversum burgenses et in burgensibus• I PetifsMS. 116.

The sheriff had made a returnagainst the burgesses, and traversed the liability of the soke,and had stated the burgesses to be in default. But it seemsthat if one of these men of religion had a shop in the borough,he must then (as William the Conqueror provided for theNormans who had been in England before his coming) be inthe commonalty of the borough and pay his custom, scot andlot, as the rest of the inhabitants.Dunstable. A charter was also granted to the church of Dunstable,which gave to it the whole manor and borough of Dunstable,and the market of the town, &c., — and the liberties and freecustoms to the town belonging, — and soc and sac, toll,them, and infangthef ; that they and their men be quit ofshires and hundreds, murder, geld, &c., and from all customsand similar exactionsThis is another instance of the exemption of ecclesiasticsand their property from temporal duties ; they being subjectto ecclesiastical jurisdiction and burdens, upon the sameprinciple as the burgesses were exempted from all dutiesand liabilities in the county at large, because they executedthem within the limits of their own jurisdiction.Rochester. ^ charter of this reign, directed to the archbishops, &c.,and to all his barons, French and English, j: also grants andconfirms to the church of Rochester, many places, with socand sac, and toll and them, and all other customs, rights,and liberties, which they ever had.• Car.

And a third grant was made to thesame effectsFrom these charters we learn that the Cnihten gild hadexisted from the time of King Edward : — but it appears clearlyto have been a separate and independent guild of itself, unconnectedwith the borough or city ; and being a voluntarysociety, the members of it would not be exempt from theordinary temporal duties, though they might have a sokeor liberty for civil jurisdiction over their tenants, which iscontinued to the church of the Holy Trinity, with sac andsoc, toll and them. However, as it was a lay fee, thoughgranted to the church, their tenantry would be subject toall temporal duties within the borough : and therefore we donot find in these charters any exemptions from suits of shiresand hundreds ; and such exemption did not in truth exist: —• Car.

The whole of this district isstill subject to the jurisdiction of the wardrobes (which arethe same as the court leet); and the inhabitant householdersare, required to attend them; and are subject to allthe liabilities resulting from that suit, as executing theoffice of constables and other offices, and serving upon inquests,&c.1122 This king also granted a charter to the citizens o( Norwich,giving them the same franchises and liberties as the cityof London then had.1103. In this year we have also a grant from Hawse, Countess'^ *^ of Gloucester, to her burgesses of Petersfield, who had/ erected houses and resided in the borough of Petersfield, and^ who should erect therein, all the liberties and free customs inthe same borough which the men of Winchester have in theircity who are in the guild merchant ; and they should have thesame in the guild merchant of Petersfield, as her father,William Earl of Gloucester, had granted to them by hischarter.9 Rich' I ^^ *^^ ^^^ y^^^ ^^ Richard L, John Earl of Moreton, continuedthe privileges to the burgesses.l^" T A^d "^y ^^ inquisition in this year it was found amongstother things, that there were there two views of frank-pledgeto be holden yearly.

And that the same earl held in the said county,on the said day on which he died, four hamlets, with the appurtenancesto the borough aforesaid pertaining ; viz. Mapel-durham, Weston, Nutctide and Shee, of the Lord the Kingin capite, together with the pleas and perquisites of courtsto the aforesaid borough and hamlets pertaining ; all whichborough, hamlet, market, hairs, courts, fees and advowsonaforesaid, are holden of the Lord the King in capite, as parcelof the honour of Gloucester, by military service.In this year Humphrey, Earl of Buckingham, Hereford, jgH^yiStafford, Northampton, and of Perche, Lord of Brecon andWilderness, by a charter, reciting that a certain pension /of five marks, from the burgesses of his lordship of Peters *field, in the county of Southampton, by one Maud Hereofthe lady there, in the time of the said countess only,and not before or afterwards (as by the evidences of the saidburgesses thereupon shown to us and to our counsel, evidentlyappears) had been unjustly levied, and was takenat ttvo law days, in the name of cert money, granted to theaforesaid burgesses of Petersfield, that they and their heirsfrom such yearly pension or cert, should be wholly quit.Saving always, and reserving to him and his heirs, all otherthe rents and services whatsoever by them the said burgesses,and their heirs and ancestors, to his said lordshipanciently due. \In the course of our inquiries we shall find many instancesof references made from the enjoyment by one borough of *the same privileges belonging to another; and, generally • /speaking, — the charters, — parliament rolls, — and parliamentwrits, — ^all proceed upon the assumption that the boroughswere essentially the same. At this period we have such anSCOTLAND.Henry I. instance : — ^in a grant to the prior of Dunstable, in Bedfordshire,it is directed, that whosoever came to inhabit there,should have land at 12d, per acre ; and enjoy the same privilegesand freedoms as the city of London, or any otherancient city.Ethelred,England.Malcolm,Scotland.1004.1124.David I.Scotland.Glanville.Re^^iamMiyeata-ten.SCOTLAND.The municipal rights of Scotland appear with sufficientdistinctness in this sera to be worthy of our attention.Although Abercromby* and Dr. Robertson says that theboroughs of Scotland first, sent burgesses to Parliament in1326, the 20th of Edward II., by order of Robert Bruce ; yetit is clear that boroughs existed in Scotland, as in England,long before that period. For in the 8th, chapter, the lawsof Malcolm II., who began to reign in 1004, relative to outlawsin the courts of the justiciar in the eyre, the sheriffs,burghs &c., states the amercement within a burgh before theprovost and baillies to be 8«.; and 4J. to the Serjeants of theburgh.It may be worth observation, with reference to the etymologyof the word Borough, (by Sir Edward Coke, referredto the Saxon word borrow, a pledge,) that, in the 8th chapterof these laws, relative to the duty of the coroner, bail areconstantly mentioned under the term borgh : — it being theredirected, that the offender may be let to borgh by the king'sletter until the justiciar come.It was at this period, about thirty or forty years before thecompilation of the book of our laws under the name ofGlanville, that the Regiamm Majestatem of the Laws of Scotlandis supposed to have been compiled.It is true, Craig does not conceive that treatise to be ofgreat authority; but the other writers on the Scotch law,particularly Lord Wanton, differ from him on that point.At all events, it is probably a work of sufficient antiquityto justify its being here used to illustrate the subject ofour present inquiry; as far, at least, as any informationcan be obtained from it ; although reasonable doubts may• Vol. i. p. 636.t Vol, i. p. 90.SCOTJJINB. 311be entertained whether it is of the antiquity which it as Henry I.BumeSy particularly as the civil law is referred to in it and Reamthe Pandects were not discovered at Amalfi till 1 130. In ten.other parts of the work, as well as in the Leges Burgorum,there are evidently passages which have been introduced ata subsequent period.In the 3d chapter it is said, that plea of barons pertains to Cap. 3.the sheriff of the county for pleas decided in baron court,may be redeemed in the sheriff court.The 4th chapter states, that some civil pleas which are Cap. 4.not criminal, pertain to provosts and baillies of boroughs andcities.And some criminal actions pertain to some of those judgesand their courts ; chiefly to them who have power to holdcourts with soc, sac, gallows, and pit, toll and them, in-fangthef and outfangthef — terms applied to local jurisdictions:— ^and which we have seen so constantly occurring inthe early English charters.In the 5th chapter, among the actions before sheriffs, jus Cap. 6.nicias, and baillies of boroughs, which are there particularlyenumerated, the plea concerning slaves or bondmen is directedto be before the sheriff; and the writ of distress for debts,before the justiciar, sheriffs, and baillies of boroughs; as itshall please the king by his letter to command them, particularlywithin their jurisdiction.The 7th section of the 6th chapter speaks of the matson, Cap. 6.or his toscheoderachf* (serjeant, officer, or mair of fee.)Amongst the lessons specified in the 8th chapter, one is Cap. 8.being absent at a public fair.The 13th chapter speaks of the jury.

Chapters 24 and 25 relate to the summoning the superiorca^&. or over-lords.Cap. n. The 11th chapter of the 2nd book relates to native bondmenproclaimed to liberty : and the 4th section directs, thatif the person alleged to be a bondman, affirms himself to befreeman and finds one borgh to the sheriff for his appearance,the plea shall be decided in that sheriffdom.*Freemen. Other directions follow, for the appearance of the partiesand the hearing of the case : and the 10th section provides,that if the person who affirms himself to be a freeman pros'duce divers and sundry of his kinsmen descended of thesame stock with himself, whose liberty is known, or provedin court, then he shall be msAefree: and subsequent sectionsgive directions for ascertaining whether the kinsmenwho are produced, be free or not, — ^and the judgment whichis to pass in consequence. From whence it is hardly possibleto avoid drawing the conclusion — that the modem rightof the sons of freemen to be made free, is founded upon asupposed inquiry of this kind ; and that it originated, bothin England and Scotland, in the common law, and not inany corporate privilege.Cap. 12. The 12th chapter states the different modes by which aman may come from servitude to liberty — which much resemblethose of our own law. The 11th, 12th, and 13thsections state, that every freeman may quit claim to hisbondman as far as respects himself and his heirs ; but not soas to remove the objection of any stranger to him as a jurymanor otherwise, unless the bondman was trade free withthe license, or by command of the king : — which mayperhaps be one reason why the general charters are grantedor confirmed by the king, that the inhabitants of particularboroughs should be free — as by that ineans they wouldbecome so absolutely, and not in the qualified manner mentionedabove. The I4th and 15th sections state, that if abondman has dwelt and remained peaceably upon any man's• See also Year Book, 38 Edward III. p. 34.SCOTLAND. 313land for seven years* not challenged as to his estate, he shall ^^°^y ^'be free ; and the master under whom he was born, shall not Reambe heard to challenge him, as his bondman, after sevens'years ;f and the liberty he is to have, is described to consist Jj^^nin passing, repassing, coming, and remaining, where hej®*"'^*"pleases, freely, without stop or impediment of any man : —which are almost the same words, in which the freedomof free burgesses is described, in the numerous chartersgranted in the reigns of John, Henry III., and the threeEdwards.But the 16th section provides, that no prescriptionshall hold against the king's native bondmen — for whereverthey dwell, in any man's land, they shall be restored tothe king.The 17th section provides, that if any native bondman, Bondmen,whosoever he be, remain quietly for the space of one yearand a day — ^and it is added, in a parenthesis, in differentprint, (such as the king's burgh, in their community orguild,) — and is not challenged by his master, shall be free.And in the writ of bondage, there is an exception of theking's domains and burghs.It appears equally conclusive, from these sections, as to'^PP'^**^'the freedom obtained by a seven years' residence, that theright to freedom by apprenticeship had its origin in these, orsimilar laws: — an inference much supported by the provision,that the right should accrue after the seven years ; asat present practised.The saving, in the 16th section, of the right of the king, l!^^^^ '°seems also consistent with the law as to tenants in ancient de <*«"e»°«-mesne, who are exempt from suit at the tom and leet, andpayment of the knights' wages — which could only have beenon the ground of their continuing the men or villains of theking, notwithstanding their residence in any other place.The reason of the freedom acquired by residence in any Privilegedprivileged town, has been already given, by reference to theSee also 15th chap. Deuteronomy, and the 2l8t chap. v. 2.t If the lord has not had seizin of his villain in gross within six years, he isbound by the stat. 32 Henry VIII. c. 2. See Noy, 27, Pigg v. Cales.

In the margin of the 17thsection, the 16th verse of the 23rd chapter of Deuteronomyis referred to, as the origin of that law. The passage quotedis quite general ; and the limit in it to communities or guilds,is introduced parenthetically, and in such a manner as toraise an inference, that it was a subsequent interpolation.Glanville. i^ Glanville,* the same doctrine is stated more distinctly ,+^y^ — ^and being of the community, is there made the expressedcondition of the freedom ; but the langage of that workseems to have been borrowed from the civil law. And asthe year and the day is clearly taken from our common law,and directly connects itself with the obligation of everyperson to be sworn in the Leet, after a year and a day'sresidence within its jurisdiction, applying to every body, aswell villains and others, as members of the guild, — it wouldappear reasonable to refer the whole to our common law,and to reject the limitation to the members of the guild, asan unauthorized interpolation from the civil law; particularlyas in the 9th section of the succeeding chapter, thefreedom by dwelling within the burgh, is referred to withoutany such qualification. Or being in the guild, might meannothing more than contributing to the common geld or payments,called by William the Conqueror the ^* scot and lot:"which would reconcile the whole with the law — thecharters — ^and the general history, both parliamentary andmunicipal.Year and It may be observed, that in the 10th section of this chapday.ter, the year and the day for reclaiming bondsmen from holyorders, is directed to be computed from the time the masterknew of the ordination ; on the ground, no doubt, that themaster might not have the means of knowing when it tookplace, — or at least, the law would not infer that he had suchknowledge. The same observation may be made, as to theLib. V. cap. 5.t See also charter William I. Lord Lit. His. Hen. II. App. vol. i., S26, sec. 66.Lambard's ArChyonomia, p. 173, chap. 66. Lud. ii.243.SCOTLAND. 316admission into the guild ; and yet no such period for callus Henry i.hating the year and a day, is in that case mentioned. But Re^amif the limitation as to the guild is omitted and it should be ten.left to the common law, then the question is, whether theperson who has resided a year and a day, free from thecontrol of a lord, in a borough, is not bound to do his suitreal at the Court Leet, by swearing allegiance to the kingand the law ; of the doing which, as a duty primarily to theking, and secondarily to the public, the lord is bound to take C ^^notice. ^^^-'The supposition, that the limitation to the members of theguild, is an unauthorized interpolation, is much confirmedby the circumstance, — At in a subsequent part of this samebook, the laws of the guild are given as distinct from thoseof the boroughs; and in chapter 17, this provision as to thefreedom of the bondmen of earls or barons, or any otherman coming to a burgh, and buying a burgage and dwellingin it a year and a day without challenge, is stated absolutely;and he is described as entitled to enjoy the fullliberties of the burgh as a burgess, without any limitationas to the guild, and no other exemption but as to the bondmenof the king, who are of course excluded, because notime can run against the crown.As this general provision, without any qualification, is tobe found amongst the laws of the boroughs — it seems that itshould have more weight and authority, than the other whichis not introduced so distinctly with reference to them, but tothe guilds: — as to which it is a proper insertion; becausethe residence away from the lord, is not less effectual toprocure liberty, because he was in a guild. And when speakingof a person so circumstanced, it would be natural toadopt that mode of expression, which is perfectly correct, asto the guilds, and is only rendered incorrect by assuming,that the mode of obtaining freedom, is confined to the beingin a guild.In the 14th chapter, the state of a bondman is described Bondmu.to be, as subject to the hand and power of his master : —which accounts for his not being liable to do suit at the316 SCOTLAND.Henry I. Court Leet ; because he owed allegiance to his master, who.^/Re^iam in rerum, as we have shown before, is responsible for histern. and it ^as not therefore necessary to give his pledges at theLeet.Cap. 41, The 50th section of the 41st chapter provides (as is indeedrepeated in our own law, by Sir Edward Coke), that the heirof a burgess is of perfect age when he is 14, that is, when he iabound to take the oath at the Leet, or when he can numberand tell silver, or measure cloth, or do other his father'sbusiness : — which affords a strong inference (as well as the12th chapter of the same book, in which the modes of becomingfree are enumerated), that the being free was not confinedto freeholders alone, but extended th all others who were of/\a.' ' 2ifree condition, as has been already observed, in the com-'■': ?'-.,, ments upon the Saxon laws.Another distinction, as to the duties arising from tenureand free residence, so apparent in our own law (as has beenalready mentioned, and will be hereafter further illustrated),is to be met with in this collection of laws ; as it appearsclearly, that a vassal may make sundry homages to differentlords, at the same time; but from the very nature of things,can owe suit in respect of his residence, only at one place atthe same time.Cap. t2. By the 22nd chapter of the 3rd book, it appears, that pleasand actions against lords alleged to have failed in doingjustice, pertains to the sheriffs ; and also as to undue servicesdemanded by the lords ; which would seem to show, thatmanors having Courts Baron, could still be subject to thejurisdiction of the sheriff; but the Court Leet altogetherexcludes his jurisdiction in the tom.Cap. 9. The 9th chapter of the 4th book, relative to Haymsuckin,Residence. ^^ ^j^^ freedom of cvcry man's house, describes it as, " the^ proper house, where he dwells, lies, and rises, daily and^ nightly ;^^ affording a strong instance of what the Scotch lawconsidered residence.

And if anyman remains in a town after the space of one night, thejusticiar or sheriff shall accuse him, and do with him asthey please.It will be seen hereafter, that these provisions, borrowed ,from the Saxon institutions, were the foundation of the law, (^^ ' ^'^^ ^as stated in Bracton, although the principle is there more ('*.*. P-' 'fully explained, and the precise application of the rule moreminutely detailed.It will be observed, that the introduction in this place of \^ ■ ,the hcrghy is again corroborative of Lord Coke's derivation ' *of the term borough from this word ; — and although it maybeurged that the pledge here required is from the strangers Pledges,generally throughout the shire, yet it is by no meansunusual to find a peculiar application of a general term to "^some particular part of the whole, — as the leet, though a /term applicable also to the sheriffs tom, has been peculiarlyappropriated to a court of a similar descriptionheld within a smaller limited jurisdiction, — and thus theborough, being a place separated from the county in which-318 SCOTLAND.Henry 1. the freemen were to give their borrows or pledges, had thatname appropriated to it as a characteristic distinction.The analogy between this law, and the modem vagrantlaws as well as its connection with questions of fixed inhabitancyand parochial settlement, will readily be recognized.Cap. 67.

Chapter 101 provides, that all officials, justiciary, chamberlains,sheriffs, provosts and baillies, after they are out oftheir offices, are to remain in the same places in which theyexercised their office, for 40 days and that publicly, and thatall men might have free liberty to complain against them.The reader will not fail to remark, that the period of40 days, so common in our law, is here also adopted.Rutherrien ^^ ^^^ ^® ^^ \idLYe bccu at present able to discover, theearliest charter granted to any borough of Scotland is inL the 26th of Henry I., where it is said that King David madeRutherglen free borough.*syr. iTie same king also granted another charter, making aborough at the castle of Ayr and giving to the burgessesthere dwelling ^ all the privileges of other burgesses dwellingin other boroughs.Wight on Scotch Elections, 36 ; and see unprinted Statutes.SCOTLAND. 319We find also an early charter to Inverkeithingy granted Henry I.\yy King William the Lion to the magistrates and burgesses inner.of that boroughs which however, supposes the previous existenceof a borough with extensive privileges.These, as far as we can now ascertain, appear to be themost ancient charters relative to th€< Scotch boroughs.*It is impossible not to draw from them the inference, that ^the burgesses in all the boroughs were of the same class,and that they were all dwelling within the boroughs, whichwe shall find hereafter confirmed by the Laws of King Davidoccurring in the next reign.STEPHEN.King Stephen, succeeding his uncle Henry L, contrary to H35the fealty he had sworn to Matilda, found it necessary to ii54.ingratiate himself, by every possible means, with the nation,and particularly with the citizens of London, to whom heis said to have given a confirmation of the charter ofKing Henry — ^and to the nation at large he confirmed allthe liberties and good laws which his uncle had granted tothem, and all the laws and customs they hed in the time ofKing Edward. It is therefore obvious that at this periodthe Saxon institutions had the full authority of laws, andwere recognized as such by the king and the people. Andthe king directed that the barons and men of England (inthe language of the charters of that sera) should have and holdall those laws and liberties to them and their heirs, freely,quietly and fully :f — ^which probably was considered a sufficientrecognition of all former privileges, as well of particularplaces, as of his subjects generally, which may account forthe few municipal charters occurring in this reign.See Appendix to Wight on Elections, p. 405.t Wilk.3J0.320 PIPE ROLLS.Stephen. ju ^ more advanced period of our history, we shall findmany of the adulterine guilds, not founded with the authorityof the crown, called in question.

We should shortly state, that in the first entry of Oxfordshire,the account of Bestoldus is chained with a debt of115/. Its.

Nevertheless it is clear that it was, in point offact, a borough in the reign of William the Conqueror,because a burgess of Oxford occurs in Domesday in thereturn for Buckinghamshire.*In the pipe roll for Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, thesheriff renders an account of the aid of the boroughs. Thesame entry occurs for Wiltshire and Dorsetshire; in theformer of which the toll of the market of Salisbury is mentionedas belonging to the town of Wilton, which the kinggranted to the Bishop of Salisbury. A sum is pardoned tothe burgesses of Dorchester on the ground of their poverty.The reeve of Malmsbury also renders an account of the firmof that place, separately from that of the sheriff.Thomas of Worcester has a debet that he might bealderman in the guild of the merchants of Worcester. Thesheriff returns an account of the aid of the borough of Cambridge.The tellarii, or weavers of Huntingdon, render anaccount of 40«. for their guild. The sheriff of the countyrenders an account of the aid of the borough of Southward;and the same occurs of many other boroughs in other counties— as the city of Gloucester — thetford — Norwich — IpswichBedford — tamworth — Stamford. There is a free gift orrelease of the burgesses of Hertford on account of theirpoverty. ;The sheriff of Kent renders an account of the firm ofDover, and Robert of Hastings of the lestage of Hastingsand Rye. There is also a similar entry for Exeter. Theaid of Tamworth excused upon account of poverty.Besides the above entries of the aids of the boroughs,accounted for by the sheriff, there are others accounted forseparately: — as Windsor — Northampton-^ihe city of CoUChester — Wallingford — and Carlisle. The burgesses of Durhamaccount for 100^. of a plea ; and os. is given to themas a free gift on account of the burning of their houses.It is worthy of remark, that, as in Domesday, no boroughfol. 143. B. coLl.VOL. I. V322 PIPE ROLLS.-DEVIZES.^^^P^^"' in Cornwall is mentioned ; so likewise no aid of any boroughin that county occurs in the pipe rolls.From these extracts it is evident, that the guilds-weredistinct from the boroughs: — that some of the boroughsaccounted for their aids themselves, — whilst others were stillso far under the jurisdiction of the sheriff, that he receivedand accounted for them.We have seen before, in Domesday, that some persons mrhowould otherwise have been burgesses, were excused, and eluded, from the duties and privileges of that class, on account1 of their poverty : — so also here, many of the boroughs are1 excused from their dues to the king on the same ground.And if the same cause long continued ; — and they did not\ pay their dues to the crown, nor exercise their jurisdiction ;particularly that of the court leet, — at which the suit royal\ was due to the crown, and the criminal and municipal policeof the executive government, ought to be administered, — theI exclusive rights and privileges of the borough would cease ;I and it would be again absorbed into the county : — ^all thoseI important public acts being then performed in the largerdistrict of the county, they would altogether cease in thatof the borough. Two striking instances of which we shallhereafter have occasion to quote.The Empress Maud, during the short time she held theregal power in this country, appears to have granted a charterDevizes, to the borough of Devizes"* where the Bishop of Salisburyhad lately built a castle, which Stephen compelled himto relinquishes The queen, probably to obtain the favour ofthe town, which had suffered under the king, granted to themthis charter of privileges.The same queen expressly recognized, by her grant, thecorporate power of abbeys ; at least as far as related to theirperpetual succession ; as she contradistinguished them fromthe laity, who could take only by inheritance. For it• Amongst the early writers, this town received the several appellations ofDevise;, Diviss, De vies, and Division, — because it is said to have been divided betweenthe king and the Bishop of Salisbury. And even as late as Henry VIII., thetown was called by Leland, " The Vies."t Gul. Neubr. p. 362. Sax. Chron. p. 238. Will.

But in1138 they were re-granted. Afterwards, Hugh Bigod having ^^^^'incited the citizens to revolt, their liberties were again takenby the king ; but subsequently restored to them in 1162. ^1^2.Scotland.The laws and constitutions of burghs made by King 1136.David I. of Scotland (who lived in the time of King Stephen) Stephen.next require our attention.The first chapter provides, that each burgess shall pay Burgage,yearly to the king, for every burgage which he defends andholds of him, and for every rood of land, five pennies.From which it appears, that the boroughs in Scotland, aswell as those i^ England, were held by burgage tenure;and the term, " he defends so frequently occurring inDomesday, is also used in this record.The second chapter speaks of the making of burgesses. Makingand the oath they were to take, to be faithful and true to the ^^^*^'king, his baillies, and the community of the burgh.This place derives its name " Stratford," from an ancient ford over the RiverLea, on the line of the Roman stratum or road from London to Dnrolitum(Layton in Essex). Matilda, Queen of Henry I., passing this dangerous ford,narrowly escaped being drowned, and ordered a bridge to be erected, from thearched foci of which, the village received the adjunct to its name.y2324 SCOTLAND.^^«^P**^°' The third and fourteenth, and many of the subsequentLege chapters, mark the distinction between burgesses and uplandBurgundy. * ' ^ .Cap. 3. 14. ^^^ ' ^^^ ii ^^^ 19LW9 of the guild, they are also distinguishedfrom landwardmen, or persons living out of the borough.Cap. 5. In the fifth chapter, the distinction between burgesses andmen dwelling without the borough, again occurs.Cap. 6. fjjg sixth chapter confines the jurisdiction of all thingsoccurring within the borough to its limits : and the seventh,prohibits burgesses from answering without it.The distinction between burgesses and merchants (in themargin called, stranger merchants) giving so decisive ananswer to the hypothesis in Brady, that the merchants werethe burgesses, is distinctly marked in the eighth chapter-cap.9. The ninth chapter secures the peaceable possession of landsafter a year and a day.Cap. 13. The burgess is described in the 13th chapter, much in thesame manner as the citizen of London is in the Liber Assisarumof Edward IIL It says, ^' If a husbandman dwelling without'^ burgh, has a burgage within burgh, he shall not be esteemeda burgess, but in that burgh in the which he has the burgage; and if the husbandman, being a burgess, challengesa bui^ess dwelling within burgh, he shall defend himselfby the law of the burgh"* The next sections also speakof the burgess dwelling night and day continually withinthe burgh, as contradistinguished from the husbandmanbefore mentioned. +There is undoubtedly some little intricacy in the constructionof this passage ; as there is in the book of assiserespecting the citizens of London. But upon the whole, itis clear that the non-resident owner of the burgage is onlya burgess sub modo, and not a perfect burgess, from whomhe is expressly distinguished.Cap. 15. The 16th chapter speaks of the burgesses of earls, abbots,priors, and barons, as distinguished from the king's burgesses.Establishing that burgesses were by no means confinedto the king's boroughs.See before, in Domesday, observations upon burgesses entered as belonging toother manors,t See before, p. 71, Dover — Domesday—" Manet atsiduut"SCOTLAND. 325Chapter 16 provides, that a burgess's son, as long as he Stephen n.sits at his father's table, shall have the like liberty as his Leges^ Burgorum.father, to buy and sell; but when he passes therefrom, Cap.ie.he shall not trade, nor enjoy that liberty, except he be theson of a burgess.The latter branch of this chapter is almost unintelligible,unless it means, that a burgess's son, when separated fromhis father, shall not enjoy the liberty of the borough unlesshe be found by the jury, or acknowledged by the rest of thecommonalty, to be the son of a burgess.Chapter 18 speaks of stranger merchants, who are pro cap. 18.habited from buying merchandise within or without burgh,except from a burgess.By chapter 20, it is directed, that no man but a king's Cap. 20.burgess, shall have an oven for baking bread in his ownland. And chapter 21 speaks of the jurisdiction of theprovost as to bread, which is analogous to the assize ofbread in our leets. Other chapters in the same manner,relate to the brewing of beer, to weights and measures,to which also chapter 133 refers.In chapter 65, the provosts, baillies, and Serjeants, are cap.65.prohibited from baking bread, or brewing ale to be sold.And in other parts of the Thorough laws, there are prohibitions,as in ours of the leet, against swine being atlarge. And so also as to hedges.Chapter 29 contains the following sections : — . Cap. 29.Section 1. — When a man is made a new burgess, having nohabitable land, he may have respite or continuation for paymentof his borough miles for a year,* which is called hirset.Section 2. — And after a year and a day, he shall big andinhabit his land.Section 3. — If thereafter it is wasted by fire or warfare,and he has other habitable land, he may dimity the wastedland, and not inhabit until he have power to rebuild.These sections strongly imply, that the burgesses wereinhabitants.House male and mail men are afterwards mentioned, in chap. 57 ; and in chap.68, male is spoken of with respect to the Icing's mills, as synonymous with Firm.t " Digged land," or land built upon.\f .'326 SCOTLAND.Stephen.

And the 2d and 3d sectionsspecify what should be paid on market days by strangermerchants, for covered stands or booths./ ' Chapter 43 states, that there were three head courts'yearly/ within burghs, at which all burgesses should appear : — thefirst after Michaelmas, the second after Christmas, the thirdafler Easter.''^The second section provides, that whatever burgess was notpresent at these courts, being within the burgh, should pay aninlaw of Ad.y except he lawfully excuse himself, or is sick orforth of the country, or at a fair. This '^ inlaw" was no doubtdue on the ground, that in consequence of his absence, he hadnot been sworn to the law ; and therefore was not, accordingto the words of the London charter of William I., lawworthy ; and by the general law, would require fresh admission,for which he should pay another fine.The 3d section provides, if he be a bui^ess dwelling withoutthe borough, and was absent from the court, he shouldpay 8«., and that for this cause ; because a burgess dwellingin the country or landlord, was not compelled to any courtbut to their three yearly head courts.This last section would appear to support the doctrine ofnon-residence, at least as it is stated in the above translation.But the fact is, that the Latin is to a different import,and merely speaks of a person being without the borough,which seems to relate only to a temporary absence ; a constructionmore consistent with the expressions in the 2dsection, of being " forth of the country, or at a fleur," aswell as with the attendance at the three yearly courtsThese courts appear to be analogous to our Court Leet ; and the courts forpleas of lands and moveable goods, which, by chapter 51, are directed to beheldwithin the borough every 15 days, to that of the Court Baron, and HundredCourt.SCOTLAND. 327provided for by the latter part of the 3d section, and to Stephen.ivhich they would not be liable unless they were resiants.

The " honest men of the bwrgh,^were the burgesses by whom the election is directed tobe made ; and the '^ indwellersy^ to whom alone the bailiffs areto swear fidelity, were the same class. The manner in whichthey are here introduced strongly indicates that the privilegesof the borough were confined only to them; and therefore tothem alone the bailiffs bound themselves.Directions against forestalling, and for the regulation ofthe markets, follow.Cap. 80. Chapter 80 speaks of the " watchers'' of the town, who inWatch, chapter 86, are more particularly described as one man fromeach inhabited lousy to pass from door to door with a staff,and after curfew with two weapons.SCOTLAND. 329And in chapter 107, widows are described to be liable to Stephen,the burden of furnishing a man to watch ; and also to all the Lege*° / Baigonun.Other public burdens, if they partake with their neighbours Captionbuying and selling.By the eth chapter, it is provided, that no dyer, shoe Cap. 99.maker nor fresher, shall be a brother of the merchant guild ;a provision for which it may be difficult to account : — butit distinctly shows, that the brethren of the guild were separatefrom the burgesses.Chapter 102 speaks of the council of the committee of the ^*p* *^*burgh $ and chapter 122, of the community.Chapter 108 provides, that a burgess dwelling without the ^^p* burgh,may not buy, nor sell, nor be free in any other burgh,but in that in which he is burgess.This passage must be taken with some limitation ; otherwiseit would seem to authorize non-residence, which wasinconsistent with the general law as it then stood. If a manwent to live in another place out of a borough, he wouldhave been obliged to give an account of himself, and saywhere he had before given his pledges :— till after 40 days,however, he would not be entitled to be enrolled in the placeof his new residence ; and if he did not enrol himself therewithin a year and a day, he would be agreeable.By this chapter it appears, that a man, when he left abui^h, was immediately by that act, disabled from exercisingor claiming the privileges of a burgess of that borough, in anyother place : — and any limited privileges he was allowed toenjoy where he was an enrolled burgess, must, to reconcilethe law to the other parts of the same system, be confinedto the year and the day, during which the burgess had theopportunity of returning to his former residence, not havingnecessarily been enrolled in another place.Chapter 109 states — If the Gamesters of wool pass forth of Cap. 109.the borough, or landthwart, there to work and use their offices,having sufficient occupation within the burgh, they should betakenand imprisoned.The local and limited nature of the borough jurisdiction, Cap. 1 1*2.is shewn by the 1 12th chapter, which directs, that a summons Summons.L '330 SCOTLAND.Stephen, within a burgh, against a burgess-man by the king's serjeant,Le8«i shall be void ; because they ought to be made by the serjeantof the burgh, who is to summon the man at his dwellingt ' house.

If the burgess had nothing by which he couldbe distrained within the borough, it would be difficultfor the provost, bailiffs, or community, having only jurisdictionwithin it, to enforce a due performance of all theoffices to which a buigess was subject ; or the payment ofthe several rates, and other burdens, to which he wasliable. If he had land alone, there might be no distressupon it, by which these duties could be enforced ; but if theland was inhabitable, or, as it is called, '^ hospital," thatis, having a house inhabited upon it, then the borough wassure of having as well distrainable property there, as an♦ Ll.

For it says — that two men, at one time, bothtogether, cannot have the freedom of one burgage. This,of course, speaks of the burgage which could make a burgess^that is, according to the last chapter, '' terra hospital,"or land with a house upon it.The first part of this chapter, speaking of fee fanners,clearly shows that burgess-ship was not confined to the l .'owner of the burgage ; but extended to the tenant. And as iburgess-ship was connected with resiancy, and only one personcould be burgess for the same house, it follows, that thetenant was the burgess, and that the lord was excluded fromthat privilege.Chapter 139 states, that it is a statute of King David, that ^*p- ^^'all his burgesses shall be free through all his realm, as wellby land as by sea, to sell and buy for their own profit andcommodity, without any trouble or perturbation, under onefull amercement — because they are under his protection.It is impossible not to observe the coincidence between thewords of this chapter, and those which occur in the earlycharters of privileges, granted by our kings to the boroughsin England ; as well as the similarity between the protectionand privileges here granted by King David, and that whichwas enjoyed by our boroughs, under the early royal charters.Chapter 123 relates to those who are free from custom — Cap. 123.speaking of that freedom within burghs and also within332 SCOTLAND.Stephen. sheriffdom where they dwell — ^which expressly confirms theBm^Sram doctrine wc have before insisted upon — ^that the burgessesdwelling within boroughs, who owed suit at the court leetthere, were of the same class of Freemen, as those, whodwelling without boroughs, and in the shire at large, owedsuit to the sheriff's tom.The Eyre, j^ the same book with the Regiamm Majestatem, is eventhe precept for the eyre, which directs the provosts and bill' ' lies in Edinburgh, to summon their ctnnbvtgesses dwellingwithin the borough or without. And all baillies, &c., andother officers who have intromitted or used any officewithin the borough since the last eyre ; also to return thenames of the suitors of the court of the burgh, and the brethrenof the guild, and those who hold booths of merchandise ; aswell dwelling within, as without the burgh, with many otherdirections relating to the jurisdiction of the eyre.And the second chapter directs, that all the burgessesdwelling landthwart, should be summoned to answer tosuch things as should be laid to their charge. These preceptsappear £sain to raise an inference, that some of theburgesses lived without the borough ; but to reconcile thiswith the general law, which requires the residence of thebui^sses, their absence must be supposed to be of atemporary, or occasional nature.The directions which follow as to the power of holding thecourt, appear to conform generally with the proceedings ofthe sheriff's tom or court leet ; and also to embrace thefunctions of the court baron. But the 9th requires, the namesof all the burgesses, dwelling within or without the borough;and a separate list of the guild brethren, distinct from thoseof other burgesses.The articles of inquiry of the bailiffs seem to correspondwith those of the leet. One of them is, that they raise atenth and taxations unlawfully, without the counsel of the«community of ^^The borough. — ^^The next is, that ^^They sell amigive the liberties of the borough to strangers ;* — that theySee before, p. 107 ^ and Rex v. Breton, iv. Bur. 2267.• .»'SCOTLAND. 333-may buy, and sell with burgesses, and use the rest of the Stephen,commodities and liberties of the burgh. That they do notvetch the borough properly, by which the neighbours areinjured. And they cause the poor, and not the rich, tohatch.Another article in the 39th chapter to be inquired of, is, Cap. 39.'^ If any man has abjured the town, to pass forth of the** burgh and is returned again;" — which appears in conformitywith our former suggestion, to show, that thedwelling out of the borough was only a temporary absence.In the same chapter they are also directed to inquire; ''If'' any man causes one dwelling landthwart to come to theborough court, in hurt and prejudice of his neighbours." /As the former application of the term landthwart to bur-k.^/'/.gesses who owed suit at the borough court, must be treated,in order to make it correspond with the general law, asreferring only to a temporary residence out of the borough ;so must this passage, which excludes landthwart men fromserving in the court, be taken as applied to a permanentresidence landthwart. The propriety of each of these constructionsis supported by the consideration, that, withoutsome such explanation, the two provisions would appearcontradictory.Another article speaks of the brethren of the guild. Andanother directs inquiry, whether the baillies sell the libertyof the burgh without consent of the community.The grant of land to religious persons in mortmain, appears ?to be prohibited, — and is a confirmation that in those timesthe ecclesiastics were the only persons who were recognizedin law, as having perpetual succession, and on that ground,designated as holding in mortmain.The 35th article inquires, if any man not having theliberty, uses it against the liberty of the burgh, within orwithout the same, to the hurt of the king and his burgh.And the 40th chiefly inquires as to those who use the libertyof the burgh, not having begged land within the burghafter a year and a day.64.

But beforethis be done, the baillies shall present each person bodilybefore the justices, at the first day of the eyre.This is directly in conformity with the law and practice ofthe courts leet in England ; and is the real meaning andfoundation of the resiants being presented, sworn, andenrolled at the court leet, as required by the ancient Saxonlaws.Condition From all these documents, — as well the general chartergranted by King Stephen to the nation at large — as the particularcharter he granted to Winchester — ^from the pipe rollsreferring to the boroughs in England — the document ofQueen Matilda, relating to the ecclesiastical corporations —and the laws of King David relative to the Scotch boroughs-takencollectively, the same irresistible inference we havebefore drawn from the previous records is confirmed ; namely,that both the law and practice of our early institutions applied,• Ll.

He expresslymentions that the liberties should extend over the ward ofPortsoken, to which we have before adverted, as extendingover the property of the Cnihten gild, as well within thewalls as without — referring to the charter of Henry I., andalso to the ancient customs of the city.The king also granted to the citizens of Canterbury, a Canterburycharter, in words nearly the same as that to London, acquittingthem of pleading without the walls, with the usual provide -sons as to murder — lodgings — ^and freedom from toll — ^as inthe time of King Henry L That there should be no miskenningin pleas, — and that J>urgh-motes should be held bythem ; as was provided in the London charter with respectto the hustings. The citizens have also their hustingsgranted to them as those of London; and in other respectsit is in perfect accordance with the charter of that place.It seems from Somner, that this king also granted that the• Wilk. 318.f 7336 CANTERBURY .scythe.Henry II. citizens should be governed by two bailiffs, at a fee-farm of60/. : — ^and in the charter the city is called a boroughsU' Shortly after this period, it appears that there was amayor of Canterbury : — as that officer is mentioned in a recordimmediately succeeding the last, in Somner's Appendix.AH these officers — ^whether reeves, bailiffs or mayors — ^wereonly the officers of the crown, appointed for the governmentof the place : — but not in any respect denoting, or connectedwith, any peculiar corporate privileges. It is also an obviousinference from these charters, as well as those we shall hereaftercite, that the privileges granted were intended for}! the benefit of the inhabitants of the place, and of noneother; as from the nature of them they could only beexercised by them, and not by presidents : and that theburgesses of Canterbury, like those of the other boroughs,were only the freemen residing within the borough, as contradistinguishedfrom the freemen living in the county at largewithout the borough. We find that they are called the1155. " burgesses'' at this time; and when the county paid danegeld,the burgesses of Canterbury paid an aid, and a bonum,and the burgesses of Rochester an aid.f As a confirmationthat all the boroughs were nearly under similar circumstances,we find that the tellarii and bolengarii both paidfor their gelds in the same manner as we have before seenin the pipe rolls for the county of Huntingdon, and otherplaces.Hythe. The king also granted to the men of Hither, acquittancesof toll, and all custom of their buying and selling throughoutEngland, with sac and soc, toll and them, &c. ; andfreedom from suits of shires and hundreds, as their ancestorshad the same in the times of King Edward, William I.and II. and Edward I., and that they should not plead elsewhere,except where they were wont, and when they ought,to wit at Shepway.

Know ye, that I have granted to my ftwr- / .gesses of Bristol, that they shall be quit both of toll andpassage, and all custom, through all my whole land ofEngland, Normandy, and Wales, wherever they shallcome, they and their goods : Wherefore I will and strictlycommand, that they shall have all their liberties andacquittances, and free customs, fully and honourably, asmy free and faithful men; and that they shall be quit of ^toll and passage, and of every other custom ; and I forbid i ^'* any one to disturb them on this account contrary to thismy charter, on forfeiture of lOZ. Witnesses, &c."* / tFrom this charter it is evident, that Bristol — the burgesses ^of which are mentioned in Domesday — continued a borough ;as this grant is to the burgesses, as a body then existing. Buttheir charter is clearly net one of incorporation : — ^nor doesit speak of the burgesses as incorporated : — but rather describesthem by their common law character of " free andlawful men," (liberi et legales homines.) As the king isspeaking in his own person, and a lawful man is one whohath sworn his allegiance or faith to the king, the chartercalls them '^ mei liberi et fideles homines."In the 30th year of this reign the " men of Bristol paid asum of money for the privilege of not pleading without theirwalls ;t which terms must, as in the last instance of Hythe,be considered as synonymous with " burgesses."Henry 11. also granted a charter to his men dwelling in themarsh near the bridge of Bristol: J — ^which is only materialfor the purpose of showing, that the objects of thisgrant were the inhabitants, or the persons who dwelt in themarsh.So London Charter, Hen.

But it is altogether unimportant toour inquiry, which preceded the other; as they were nodoubt nearly contemporaneous, and the substance of the oneborrowed from the other.It has also been doubted by some lawyers, whether Glanville'swork was admitted as an authorized compilation ofthe English law. In Powder it is said that '^ Bracton andGlanville are not writers in our law : " — but this seems byrSee the able translation of Mr. Beams, and the valuable notes added to it ; fromwhich we have had the advantage of obtaining many references.t Inst. iv. 345.1180.GLANVILLE.{VilV,.Old^Henry II. Saunders in Stowed's case, to be the only dictum doubtingtheir authority.* Reeve, in his history of the English law,calls it rather a compendium than a finished tract i-f- whichis in some degree justified by the prologue to the workswhere it is said, that it is impossible to reduce to writing, thelaws and rights of the kingdom, as well on account of theignorance of the writers, as of the confused multiplicity ofthe laws.The enumeration of pleas of the crown, in the secondchapter, appears to correspond precisely with the Saxon laws.And an important principle, to which we shall hereafter haveoccasion to recur, when we speak of Old Sarum, and theother decayed boroughs, is contained in this chapter: inwhich, having first referred, (as commentators read thepassage,) to the sheriff's turn, it is added, that it belongsto the sheriffs upon the default of the lords to take cognisanceof criminal pleas ; — ^which is obviously introduced to preventa defect of justice. So that if a special jurisdiction, withinany local limit taken out of the county, should prove defective,on account of those who are entitled to the jurisdictionbeing unable, or neglecting to exercise their powers, and administerthe law ; the general jurisdiction of the sheriffwould re-attach upon it. So that whenever Old Sarum, or anyother place, had ceased to have such a population, as couldcontinue its separate jurisdiction, it ceased to be a borough,and the sheriff's jurisdiction revived. The general applicationof this rule to all similar defaults, is afterwards recognizedin the fourth chapter; in which pleas of nativebondsmen are mentioned; and instances will occur in thecourse of our inquiry, where boroughs have ceased to exercisetheir exclusive privileges, on these and similar grounds.In the 19th chapter we find allusion made to the lawfulmen of the county, (legales homines de comitatu.)In the 25th, the limitation of .40 days, a period of timeso frequently adopted in the English law, is applied to es-signs,or excuses for not appearing.

The fifth book relates to villainage. It commences withthe plea raising the question of the state or condition of individualsin society. Which occurred in that time when oneclaimed another, from a state of freedom into villainage ; orwhen one in villainage, sought his liberty. If a personclaimed another to be in villainage, as his native bondman,he was to have a writ of neifty directed to the sheriffs: bywhich he should claim the villain before the sheriff of theplace, against him who held him in villainage; and if the villainagewas not denied, then the plea respecting the villainshould proceed before the sheriff, the claimant, and the personwho had the villain. But if he who was demanded, said he wasa freeman, and gave security to the sheriff, to prove the fact;then the sheriff should proceed no further, but the complaintshould be before the king's justices, in the king's court.In this chapter, we perceive the villains ont freemen clearlycontradistinguished from each other as a state and conditionin society ;* not as depending on tenure ; still less as resultingfrom any connection with a corporation or corporateprivileges.The writ makes the same distinction we observed before.And in the proof upon the trial, in chapter 4, theevidence is to be by those of the same stock, by whoseliberties, if they should be recognized and proved in court,he who claims his freedom, should be freed from the yoke ofservitude. But if the liberty of those produced be denied,or if it is doubted, recourse should be had to the vicinage,that by their oaths it might be known, whether these menwere free or not: and it should be adjudged accordingly. If,on the contrary, it should be proved, that those who wereproduced were native bondsmen, so that they came from onecommon stock with the claimant, then the vicinage shouldHen. Hist. II , vol. iii. p. 189.l/UCM^GLANVILLE.-VILLAINAGE./inquire who are the nearest related to the claimants : and ^^^^nr H .it should be adjudged accordingly.*Other provisions are made, for determining the questionof villainage or freemen.From the whole tenor of this book, and the very particularprovisions contained in it, no one can doubt, that the tholequestion of freedom by birth is to be traced as originatingin the common law, — and has nothing to do with any corporateright or privilege.It is therefore evident, that the usages, which have been nowso strangely imported, as connected with corporate rights,into the practice of many boroughs in England, are borrowedfrom this chapter ; as the proof by relations, of their freedom,is clearly the type of the admission by the father'sright to freedom. The distinction between those whoserights were known and recognized, as being born withinthe place, is here also alluded to ; and distinguished fromthose, who not being born in the place, were not known orrecognized as freemen, — and therefore were obliged to havetheir freedom established, by proof before the jury at thecourt leet; or proved inferentially and necessarily by thefinding of the fact, that they had lived a year and a daywithin the place, away from their lords, if they had any : —which absence, by the chapter we shall quote hereafter,would make them free.The fifth chapter speaks of the many modes by which a J?jMp* ^■person being in a state of villainage, could be emancipatedinto a state of freedom. First, by actual emancipation bythe lord : next, by gift, or sale to another : and many othersare enumerated in the Mirror : — there being no question, aswe have observed before, that, from the spirit of our ancientinstitutions, so favourable to liberty, the modes of emancipationwere from time to time increased — as the spirit ofliberty spread, and the changes of society lessened the necessityfor bondmen.The general principle upon which villainage or emancipationdepended, was that of the mutuality of service, uponSee also Mirror, chap. 3, sec. 23.GLANVILLE.-VILLAINAGE.kStory III the one handy — and protection, upon the other. If, by the/ default of the lord, that mutuality was in any way defeated,/ the condition of villainage was destroyed.r ^-^ But there is one restriction upon the acquisition of liberty,j which should be remarked. A villain could not purchaseit with his own money ; because all the goods of everynative bondman were understood to be in the poiver ofthe lord — so that the villain could not redeem himselffrom bondage, by his own proper money, against his lord.But if any stranger (extraneous — ^that is, some stranger tothe demesnes of the lord,) should purchase the freedomwith his own money, the villain might always defend himself,in a state of liberty, against his lord. In the same chapter itis also expressly stated, that a person born a villain, thoughafterwards emancipated, might be objected to as a witness.After which follows the passage to which we have sofrequently adverted. ^* If any native bondsman shall havedwelt quietly — that is, quit, or without claim, for a yearand a day in any privileged town," (and from principles oflaw, the same rule would apply — subject to the qualificationwe shall mention hereafter — to his dwelling in anyplace, whether in the county at large, or in any citycastle, borough, or town,) " away from his lord, so that he*' should be in their community — to wit, the guild ; " thatis to say, so that he shall have been received as a citizen, orburgess, as one of their commonalty, subject, in the languageof Domesday, to geld with them, or by the laws of Williamthe Conqueror, to pay scot and lot with them ; '' he shall ,by that act, be emancipated from villainage"*In Bracton it is said,f that if within the year the lordclaimed the villain, then it would not operate as a bar to thelord. There is also a provision in the Regiamm Majestatem,and the Leges Burgorum of Scotland, that if the villainremained away from his lord for seven years it was conclusiveevidence against the lord, by which his right was foreverbarred. But that conclusion was not to be drawnuuVide etiam Let. lib. iv. cap. 11 ; et Co.

" Therefore the summary of the lawupon this heady appears to be this : — during the progressof a year, if a villain lived away from his lord, he mightreclaim him as his fugitive ; and by giving notice to those-with whom he dwelt, would be entitled to have his villainreturned, — or could maintain his action against those whodetained him. But if the villain dwelt in any place ayear and a day, away from his lord, then the villain wasbound, by the general law, to do his suit at the sheriff'stom, or court leet* And upon the jury presenting the factof the residence, he would be entitled and bound to besworn as a freeman; and enrolled and recorded as such.Such a title could not be defeated, but by a record ofequal or superior authority. And therefore, after suchinferential proof, and record of freedom, the lord could notreclaim his villain, but by due course of law; and, consequently,he was driven to his writ de native replegiando,which he might have at any time within seven years; butafter that period he was barred for ever. Hence it is cleararose the conclusive evidence of the freedom by service andresidency under a contract of apprenticeship for seven years,in the manner we have already explained. But even thattime was not conclusive against the king, and thereforesuch a claim of freedom was not perfect, unless sanctionedby the grant of the king. Hence no such claim could besetup in the sheriff's tom, because that court existed underthe common law, and not by charter. On the contrary sucha claim would be conclusive, even against the crown, withinthe jurisdiction of a court leet, which could not exist, beingan exception from the common law, but by the charterof the crown. Hence it is that Glanville uses the term of** privileged tawTiy' as applied to places enfranchised by theking's charter.In the preceding clause of the same chapter it is said, '^ he\Vet352 GLANVILLE.-VILLATNAGE.Henry II. « who has obtained his freedom may defend himself foragainst his lord, or any of his heirs, as long as he can legitimatelyprove this in court, either by Charter, or any othermanner." The Regiamm Majestatem adds to the passagewhich excludes a person from giving proof, or waging hislaw, if born a villain, notwithstanding he has been knighted,this further provision : — ^^ Except he received his liberty,'^ and was made free with the license, good will and specialcommand of the king," — ^which are the words usually insertedin the king's charter for that purpose ; and in thecase of boroughs are applied in the aggregate to all theinhabitants in the borough; and under this description theperson mentioned in Glanville would fall, as a person whohad dwelt a year and a day in a chartered borough.Chap. 6. This book concludes with a passage relative to the villainageor freedom of the children depending upon the conditionof their parents. But, as it is an intricate subject, and notimmediately within the scope of our inquiries, it is unnecessaryfor us to enter upon this field of speculation.Book vi. \^ the succeeding book, as to dower, the perpetual successionof ecclesiastical bodies, and the effects of grants whichMortmain, were Subsequently called grants in mortmain, seem to havebeen understood. For it is specially provided — that if achurch is founded, the wife shall, after the death of herhusband, have the free presentation ; so that in the case ofa vacancy she shall give it to any proper clerk. But it isadded, she cannot give it to any college, for by that shewould take away the right of the heir himself for ever —adopting most distinctly the doctrine of grants in mortmain ;which, however, it should be remembered, is applied aloneto ecclesiastical bodies.Lib. II. And in the Regiamm Majestatem this appears more distinctly,for it is added, " seeing a college never dies."The remainder of Glanville contains little to illustrateour present subject ; we therefore pass it over without ob-liberiservation, excepting to remark, that the liberi homines, andhomines. .the liberi et legales homines, occur frequently through thesucceeding books.*• Wilk.334.FREEMEN.-GELDABLE. GUIL1)S.-FEE-FARM. 363Even, therefore, at this early period of our history, we Henry II,have been enabled clearly to establish, by authentic docu-»ments, and without the possibility of doubt, the distinctionbetween the bond VLadfree, as a part of our ancient commonlaw ; and the rights of freedom, which sprung from free birth*We have, therefore, decisively negatived, that the term of** free men," so common in our law, was connected with corporations.We have also negatived the existence of anycorporations at this period, in which all authors agree. Andwe have seen, that the early charters are granted to the menof theplcLce and their heirs. We have before observed, that** guild" was a term used by our Saxon ancestors to denotethe payments to the public funds, not only within boroughs,but generally throughout the county; — in the shires at largein hundreds — ^and other divisions; and that the lands ofsome knights were exempt from guilds.We shall show hereafter, that " reliable " was the G«iidg.term emphatically applied to the county, as being thegeneral district over which such payments were to belevied. That in progress of time any body of personscontributing to the common stock were called "guilds;"such bodies existing in boroughs, though distinct fromthe general body of the burgesses; — and not necessarilyconnected with borough rights or municipal government.We have also seen, that the laws of our Saxon ancestorswere, in point of fact, continued during the Norman dynasty ;and that the institutions of the country persevered in maintaininga rigid adherence to the duties and responsibilitiesarising out of local residence, which was the sole foundationof all rights and obligations.In conclusion, before we quit this reign, we should re- i^ee-fann.mark, that the ancient fee-farms — the aids of boroughs andcities — and their reeves, are frequently spoken of in the lawsof King Henry, which we have quoted. And we mustremember, that the pipe rolls constantly refer to the as generally paid.It has been supposed by many write's — and sometimesVOL. I. A A354 Fee-farm.Henry II. in the courts of law— that every grant of a borough at fee-fernto the burgesses, made them a corporate body: —because otherwise their successors could not be bound topay the rent, and the king might therefore lose his intendedprofit of the land.* But this doctrine has been most successfullycombated by Mr. Madox, who expressly states — thatmany of the king's towns which were not, as well as otherswhich were corporate, were charged to pay to the kingyearly a firm for their town; that is to say, — ^** towns not'^ corporate might and did hold their town at firm, in^' like manner as the corporate towns W€H[«, by the king's'' favour, wont to hold." And he cites many examples fromthe great rolls to establish this point — as Cobham — Harem-^Newbum — Robiry — Clinton — Corbrig — Odiham-f- (inHampshire) — Alton — Cobham — Bray — Wykeham — Ape-thorp— Clive — Brikestok — Geytinton — ^Torp — Selreston —Mansfield — Raghenild — Darlington — Clinton andLufton. j: In all of these, the men of the place are chargedwith the fee-farm to the king ; and it cannot be supposedthat those who contributed to this payment could be anyseparate or select body ; or that any persons not inhabiting inthe place could be included. Either of such circumstanceswould be so inconsistent with the nature and obviousreason of the payment, that it must be assumed the personshere described under the term ^* Men' were the inhabitantsof the place.And if this inference be correct with respect to theseplaces which were never boroughs, nor incorporated, thesame will hold from the use of similar terms, when appliedto boroughs or to places which were subsequently incorporated; of which numerous instances are to be found uponthe same rolls, particularly with respect to talliages^ whichalso were paid by places not incorporated Thus, the men ofIpswich in several years of this reign, render an account forBro.

The men Henry ll.of Newcastle also pay their talliage; and a variety of otherplaces, which it would be tedious to enumerate.In the 27th year of Henry IL, certain directions were issued ^i^-by the king, for providing arms ; and orders are given, as towhat every lay-man should have, and what all burgesses,and all the commonalty of freemen should procure.The liberos et legales homines of hundreds — vines — andboroughs — ^as separate divisions of the country — ^are specified; and it is provided, that no one shall be received to theoath of arms, unless he is 9i freeman.In a statute compiled at this period, we find ^^ parishes* 1186.mentioned, which has not occurred in any document we have P*™**®*-before referred to, excepting once in Domesday. Burgessesand villains are also spoken of, under the name of Rustic.*In this year, a survey of the county-palatine of Durham 1183.was made, called the " Bolton Book ;"t but which does not staffordany matter to illustrate our present researches. Durham.Henry IL also granted a charter to the citizens of York ; York.as appears by the recital of one of King John to that city ;and the same to the burgesses of Appleby.The burgesses of Newcastle-uponr-Tynej also received a Newcastle., upon-grant,exempting them from toll ; which is referred to, and Tyne.confirmed by King John, in the 2nd year of his reign, andalso in the charter of Henry III.This place was doubtless, a borough by prescription ;because, although it is not so mentioned in Domesday, its** burgesses" were, in the 14th of Henry IL, before the time ''68.of legal memory, amerced for swearing a knights: Andthe charter and privileges before referred to were granted tothe burgesses.Bat it was not a corporation by prescription. For althoughthere are many early charters granted to the burgesses, and aregular succession of them can now be found — the first wasto them and their heirs — and none of them speak of any incursWilk.336.t Vide 1st Supr.

A charter was also granted to Preston making it a borough:* — the privileges being subsequently confirmed byJohn, when Earl of Moreton, and before he ascended thethrone, as well as by Henry III. and Edward III. The personswho exercised the right of election at that place, as theburgesses," were, till the reform act, the " inhabitants,"without any other limitation of scot or lot, or otherwise : — aright by far too general and unrestricted ; and as inconsistentwith the law on the one hand, as the more restricted rights inmany places, are on the other ; the usage in both instancesbeing contrary to the general law, and proving their illegalityby their differing from each other; at the same time thatthey establish the danger of allowing such usages to prevailand grow up in contravention of the law.1188. John, the king's second son, then Earl of Moreton, granted^-/ / 'j in the 34th year of the reign of Henry II., a charter to the/ r ' burgesses of Bristol, dwelling within the walls and withoutI as far as the boundary of the town ; — confirming to them alltheir liberties and free customs, which they had enjoyed inhis time, or that of his predecessors, and declaring them tobe as follows : — that no burgess should plead or be impleadedout of the walls of the town, in any plea, except thoserelating to foreign tenure, not belonging to the hundred ofthe town ; — that the burgesses should be quit of murder withinthe bounds of the town, and should not wage duel ; — that noone should take lodgings within the walls, by assignment orby livery of the marshal, against the will of the burgesses ; —^that they should be quit of toll, &c. ; — ^that no one should beBrady, p. 98.iBR1ST0L.-1N HABITANTS. 357condemned in a matter of money, unless according to the law Henry ll.of the hundred, viz, by forfeiture of 405* ; — that the hundredcourt should be held only once in a week;* — that the lands,tenures, mortgages, and debts throughout the land, and the ;lands and tenures which were within the town, should beheld,claimed, and enjoyed, according to the custom of thetown; — that pleas be held according to the custom of the town,with regard to debts and mortgages lent in Bristol; — thatno stranger should buy of a stranger — ^nor keep a wine shop,(unless in a ship) — ^nor remain more thvji forty days withinthe town ; — that no burgess should be distrained, unless he bedebtor or surety ; — that the burgesses might marry withoutlicence ; and the lords should not have wardship of their sonsor daughters, by reason of lands out of the town ; — ^that theburgesses might have all their reasonable guilds, as well orbetter than they had them in the time of Robert, and hisson William, Earls of Gloucester ; — ^that all tenures withinand without the walls as far as the boundaries, shouldbe held \n free burgage viz., by land gable service ; whichthey should pay within the walls. Permission is given tobuild upon all void places, contained within their boundaries,&c. And the privileges granted by this charter, were to beenjoyed by the burgesses and their heirs.This charter describes the burgesses with somewhat moreparticularity than is usual; the grant being ^' to his burngesses dwelling within the walls, and without as far as the** bounds of the town," which are defined. This seemsclearly to establish, that at that time all the burgesses whowere to enjoy the privileges, were inhabitants within the Inhabited: and there is not any ground tor assuming, that any ^ \of the free inhabitants, paying scot and lot, were excludedfrom, their body.The charter then gives in effect those privileges which ]were afterwards so commonly granted by King John during 'his own reign, and by his immediate successors, to this and /many other places. From the nature of which franchises 'further inferences arise, that the burgesses were the inhabitswas the Civil Court, and DOt the Court Leet.t358 BRISTOL.— INHABITANTS.-STRANGERS.Henry.? wants of the place. That, for instance, of not pleading withoutthe walls of the town, could not be enjoyed by any bnt aninhabitant; — and it would lead to great inconsistencies to suppose,that some of the inhabitants should not plead out of thewalls, and that others should ; because the sheriff and hisofficers would have to interpose their authority as to part ofthe inhabitants, and would be excluded ais to the rest. Balthis privilege was, in fact, intended, both in this place and inothers, to exclude the jurisdiction of the sheriff, and to subjectthe " inhabitants" to that of their own " hundred court,"which is spoken of in the next line of this charter.A similar inference is supported by the exemption of the burgessesfrom the fine for murder, being confined to the boundsof the town ; and still more particularly, by the burgesses be-stranger.jug contradistinguished from the *^ stranger" who in the Latinis described as *' exterior vel extraneous homo;" and as onequi non fuerit de villa." The provision, " nemo capias'^ hospicium infra muros," with others, prevented any personfrom being admitted into the town against the will of theburgesses, according to the conmK)n law, as contained inthe Saxon laws, Britton, Bracton, and Fleta. The same wasalso practised under the poor laws : by which no person couldcome to live in a place for 40 days (as is mentioned afterwardsin this charter) without notice to the tithingman, orofficer of the parish* To that law may be attributed the realorigin of the commission of strangers as burgesses; which,under some circumstances, could not legally be effectedwithout the assent of the whole body. It cannot fail to beobserved, that the other privileges also granted by thifccharter are of a local character, and clearly to be enjoyedin the town : and it is reasonable to infer, that they wereintended for the benefit of all the inhabitants — the term,^' Men of Bristol,' ('' Omnibus de Bristol") being used assynonymous with ^^ Burgesses' It must be remembered, thatthe lands within the town are to be held, according to thecustom of the town, in burgage tenure.Pr«pofitu» The principal officer of the king is the ^^ prtepositus;" inthe Saxon language called " reeve ;" in the Norman, " bailiff,"MAYOR.-KaK£NNY. 369*' pFOTosI/' aotd ** maire :" all, in effect, me9x6ng the same ^^°^ ^^'office notwithstanding so much importance has in some displacesbeen attributed to the appellation of '* mayor ;" asif that term was peculiarly applicable to corporate officers ;whereas it only described the usual functionary of the crown,appointed originally by the king, to collect his dues : butas such persons were often guilty of great oppressions, thepeople of favoured places obtained charters sometimesupon the payment of considerable sums of money, for theright of elective " one of themselves" to fill that office — aprivilege which, the king possessing for his own advantage,could sally grant to others. Many of the liberties areThose which the law would give to all persons holding freelyand in socage, by burgage tenure* — ^as freedom from wardshipand marriage. It has been often supposed, that theguilds were the foundation of the burghs; but it will be G"*^^-clearly seen, that those here spoken of, are somethingwithin the burgh, and belonging to the burgesses ; and notthe burgh itself, nor the essential characteristic of burgess-ship.It should, in conclusion, be observed of this charter,that it cannot be said to have created a corporation, even byimplication ; because, in addition to the general answer, thatnone of the early grants were charters of incorporation, —for they were not introduced till many years afterwards —this is expressly to the burgesses and their heirs, and not totheir successors.Icelandicthis year we find another borough in Ireland besidesDublin, (to which we have before referred,) receiving a grant,not from the crown, but from the Earl of Pembroke, with theconsent of Isabella his wife ; and as a confirmation of ourformer remark with respect to the Irish boroughs, it will beperceived, that the provisions of this charter to Kilkenny Kilkenny,nearly resemble those granted to London, and the other cities ^and boroughs in England. It mentions also the 40 days, towhich such frequent reference is made in the Saxon andSee List. lib. 2, c. 10, sec. 162» et seq../'3gO KILKENNY.Henry II. English laws i and contains a grant of a merchant guild :regulating (like the English charters) the tenure of theburgages: and the provisions are for the benefit of thepersons inhabiting in the borough, as they are in those ofEngland ; the grant also being to the burgesses and theirheirs.It is as follows :—William, Earl of Pembroke, with the consent of Isabellahis wife, granted to his burgesses of Kilkenny the liberties, —that no burgess should be called to answer for any causewhich should arise within the bounds of the borough andcastle, or any otherwise than in the hundred of the town,except in pleas which concern the men of his household.The hundred to be held in the town. Homicide within thebounds should not be reputed murder; and no burgess shouldbe called to trial by battle, unless it ought reasonably to bedone.* The burgesses to be free from toll, &c.; and not to beamerced unless by the judgment of the hundred, &c. ; andthe amercements were fixed for the breach of the assize ofbread and beer, watch and ward. The hundred was to beheldonly once a week ; and no burgess was to be called inquestion for miskenning.* Provisions were then made forgivingof bail; for the improper taking of toll. No foreignmerchant was to sell cloth by retail, or have a tavern for winewithin the town, except for forty days ; and if he did so,the articles should remain for the judgment of the burgessesfor the profit of the town. Powers were given to the burgessesto marry their children ; and no lord of whom the burgessesheld foreign tenements, should have the custody of their childrenor widows. It was also granted to the burgesses,that they might have a merchant, and other guilds, and allliberty belonging to them, as the custom was of other goodboroughs.Reference is made to the tenure of tenements in burgage :and it is also provided, that no burgess should be compelledto pledge his goods, unless security was made for returningthem at a certain time. If any burgess should willingly lendSo in London and Bristol.Kilkenny-SCOTLAND. 361his goods toHhe bailiff of the earl's castle if no certain Henry ii.time was fixed for their return, it should be done in 40 days.Powers were given to the burgesses to make/r^c tenants by40 feet of land ; so that they might have their liberty incommon with the burgesses — and that the burgesses and theirheirs should hold their burgages freely and quietly for ever, atthe rent which Galfridus^ son of Robert, first established, to"wit, I2d, annually for a burgage with its appurtenances;to be paid half at Easter, and half at Michaelmas. Noassise of victuals was to be made in the borough, unless bythe consideration of the burgesses and bailiff.SCOTLAND.To resume the history of Scotland, as far as relates to the wiubm i .transactions in this reign, it appears that William I., the Scotch —king, made sundry statutes at Perth,— the second chapter of Enchant, *which enumerates the bishops, abbots, earls, barons, knights,and freeholders as the persons who should appear before thejustices in eyre.The second section of the same chapter directs, that at thebeginning of every 40 days the sheriff should hold his court.Which explains the reason why persons not having residedin a borough for 40 days, were not entitled nor bound to beburgesses ; because they continued to be suitors before thesheriffs till the next court ; and if not present there, wouldbe amerced, unless they had become legal suitors elsewhere :which, after 40 days' residence in a borough, they wouldhave a right to be, on their own application ; though theywere not compellable till after a year and a day.It may generally be observed of these laws, that theycorrespond with our own sufficiently to establish that theymust both have had one common origin.Chapter 23 directs, that every man between 60 and 16 Cap. 23.should be sworn : — and afterwards specifies what each manshould be provided with, according to the land he held.Chapter 35 directs, that the merchants of the realm should Cap. 3d. ^have their merchant guild, with liberty to buy and sell,within the bounds and liberties of burghs ; clearly show*I/362 MORAVIA.-INVBRNESS.^^^°^ ^^' ing that thief was distinct from the borough, aod the municipalgOTenunent of the place.Cap. 37.

The same king also granted a charter, that the burgessesof Irwemeu should be free of toll, and all customs upontheir own chattels. — sand prohibited that any one shouldbuy or sell in that borough, or carry on in that county,without the borough, any merchandise, unless he was aburgess or a stall-keeper.The king also granted to the burgesses, for the support ofthe borough, the land without it, called Bui^halew, to wit,between the mountain and the water, so that no one shouldhave in it manage or fishing without their license.And he directed that the burgesses might enclose theborough, they afterwards supporting the fence.This king also made a third charter, by which he grantedto Manfred Blunt, his burgess of Inverness, and his heirs ; —Heirs, to all his burgesses of Inverness, and their heirs; that theyshould never have battle amongst them, nor any other burgess— nor other man should have battle against his sameburgesses of Moravia, nor against their heirs ^ — but only theiroath.The king also granted to his burgesses of Moravia andtheir heirs that they should make only half the oath, andhalf the forfeiture which other burgesses made; and that theyshould be free of toll for ever.He also granted a fourth charter, by which he appointedSunday in every week for a market day, and he justly gavehis firm peace to all who came to it.inhabited king also granted to his burgesses who should inhMthis borough of Inverness, ^* all the laws and right customs** which his other burgesses, inhabiting in his other boroughs in^* Scotland howe'' And that no one should make in the bailieon Elections, Appendix, p. 408.wants.INVERNESS. 303-wick of Inverness without the borough, dyed doth ; against Henry Ji.the assise of King Dad, the king's grandfather — wonderthe penalty of seizure of the cloth by the sheriff.The king also prohibited that any one should buy or sell-without the borough, any thing against the assise of KingDavid.Also that none should have a tavern in any country townwithout the borough, except where a resident (manes) knight ^^iftfr^should be lord of the town, and then he might have a tavernthere, according to the assise of King David.The king's bailiffs of Inverness, are ordered to be assistant,as far as they could be, to the king's burgesses ofInverness, that they might justly support them in the enjoymentof the above rightful customs.Of these charters it should be observed, that the first is agrant to the burgesses generally, without any mention ofheirs and successors, — and the others to the burgesses andtheir heirs, — sand it should not be overlooked, that thesecharters are, in effect, the same as those granted about thesame period by the English monarchs to their boroughs inEngland: — ^theq^ in Scotland also providing, like most ofthe English, that the burgesses should enjoy the sameprivileges as other burgesses and boroughs, — and confiningthe enjoyment of them to the resident burgesses.Having thus collected the laws — the most important con Concise— the charters — ^and other records — ^which are tobe found in this reign, we may deduce from them theseimportant positions. ^That at the close of this reign, so remarkable for the wis ^ -dom and vigilance with which the laws were administered,and for the cautious and reasonable reforms effected duringit, the great division of society into the two classes of bondand firee, still universally prevailed. That the distinctionof villainage and freedom depended primarily upon birth,and secondarily upon emancipation on the one hand, andreduction to a servile state upon the other. That thereare no traces of any municipal corporations, but that there364 CORPORATIONS BY PRESCRIPTION.Henry II. are, as distinguished from them, direct recognitions of corporatesuccession in ecclesiastical bodies, who held to themand their successors : and the appearances of something likecorporate existence in the guilds; which were, however,separate from the creation of the boroughs, including only apart of the burgesses, and having objects distinct from municipalgovernment. It appears also, most clearly, thatthe charters at this period were granted to the burgessesand their heirs ; so that every inference of corporate right orsuccession is altogether negatived.RICHARD I.1189 We have now arrived at that important period of the tory of this country, at which — by subsequent statutes insome instances, and the common law in others,— the timetlon!^* of legal prescription is fixed. And it being enacted, that,no lands or tenements — rights or liberties, which hadbeen enjoyed in the reign of Henry II. should requireto be proved by any charter or document in writing;'^ but that it should be sufficient to show they had beenused in the reign of Henry 11. ;" and the common lawhaving adopted the same principle, the first year of Richard I.is termed " the period of legal memory'' As it is a presumptionof law, that all rights exercised before this timehad a legal commencement ; so it is most material clearlyto define what privileges were enjoyed previous, and whatimmediately subsequent to this period; in order to placebeyond all controversy the question respecting the existenceof corporations by prescription. If it can be establishedthat there were no municipal corporations atany time prior to, this date, then the doctrine of corporationby prescription is decisively destroyed. We thereforeproceed, with this view, to quote the documentsCOLCHESTER.-.DURHAM.-WIWCHESTER. 366material to this point, which are to be found in the reign of ^<^^^<^^-Richard I.This king granted a charter to the burgesses of Colchester f* Ooich«»ter.enabling them to elect bailiffs — hold pleas of the crown —to plead within their own borough, and not without; andthat no other justice should intermeddle but such as theyshould elect.That the burgesses should be free of scot and lot, &c. ; andwhen summoned before the justices itinerant, they should beable to acquit themselves by four lawful men (^'l^aleshomines") of that borough.That they should not be obliged to receive guests, &c.,and should be free of tolls.We have in this charter (as in the former reigns) thegrant of exclusive jurisdiction — the mention of «co^ and lot-budalso the legales homines, without any appearance ofincorporation.Hugh Pudsey, Bishop of Durham, granted to his burgesses Durham.of Durham freedom from toll, and the same free privilegesas Newcastle And it is said, that at a very early periodthere was an alderman of Durham ; but there is no appearancefrom this charter, or otherwise, of its being a corporation.Richard I. granted a charter to the citizens of Winchester,']^: the merchant guild, that none of them should plead withoutthe walls, excepting of foreign pleas, and the moneyers ;nor should they make duel ; and that they might dischargethemselves of pleas of the crown according to the ancientcustom of the city. And he granted, that all the citizens ofthe merchant guild should be quit of toll, &c. That none ofthem should be adjudged to an amercement of money butaccording to the ancient law of the city, which they had inthe time of the king's ancestors. That they should have thelands, tenures and pledges according to the custom of thecity. That pleas should be held of their debts at Winchester.The reeve of the town, and exemptions from other dues,By InspezimuB in charter of Edward IV. &c. Mad. Fir. Burg. p. 28, note,t Bro.

Allwhich privileges they vere to enjoy hereditarily.This charter differs from most we have seen before, andseems to have been a peculiar grant to those of the citizens*Guide"* ^^ Winchester who were of. the merchant guild. They areparticularly described in that manner, and they could not^' be the whole of the citizens, because we have seen, by numerouscharters, that the guilds included only a action of.them : and if these had been all the citizens of Winchester,they would not have been described in this special manner.The charter was not, as was usual, granted to the generalbody of the burgesses. If we were to conjecture as toits real meaning, it would probably be best explained byrecollecting, that no person could trade who was a villain,and, therefore, that admission into a merchant guild wasyrivML face evidence of a person being free. If the merchantguild had received ito their body any person whose claim tofreedom might be equivocal, at least as against the king, itwas desirable that they should apply to the monarch to removeall doubts by granting to them this charter, which,under the law we quoted in the last reign from Glanville,would set the matter at rest as to the members of the merchantguild : all the other free inhabitants of the place payingscot and lot, would have their privileges and exemptionsunder the common law and the former charter. It must alsobe remembered, that let the nature of this charter be what itmay, the privileges were granted to them to hold hereditcarUyywhich decisively establishes, that although men of guildswere at that time often. incorporated, yet, in this instance,they were not, — ^a point which would have been more important,if all the citizens had belonged to the merchantguild; but which, upon the whole, is probably more justlyapplicable to support the position we have adopted, of theguild being only a part of the burgesses ; — and to establish,that the object of the charter was to put an end to any questionof their hereditary right to freedom.Poole-BATH.— LINCOLN. 367,We find at ilia period a barter of WUUam Longespee Richard I.granting and amfirndry to the burgesses of Poole and p^oie.their heirsy sdl the liberties and free customs, which fine, 1190. ) >citizens or largesses, of the cities and boroughs of the kii^had.That the burgesses might from themselves choose far thegovernment of their borough, six burgesses, one of whom wasto be appointed by William Longespee or his heirs, to be theprovost. Also pleas were to be held six times in the year,for measures and assises broken. Provisions were then maderespecting foreign merchants— sand talliages. The charterconcludes with granting to the burgesses herbage-tas theyhad always been accustomed — firing — ^and turbary.Poole we have seen, is not mentioned as a borough in /Domesday-*-nor are there any material documents relativeto it, before this charter.It appears however, that it was a borough before this time, 4and had burgesses who previously enjoyed privileges, becausethe charter speaks of their accustomed enjoyment ofthe right of common. The question in this borough (as inothers) is, who were the burgesses? There is no ground forsaying they were incorporated. There is not a single term ofincorporation, nor any expression or implication, which leadsto the inference that any corporation previously existed, orwas intended to be created by this charter. The grant is tothe burgesses and their Jmrsj not to their successors. — thereis no indication of any selected body of burgesses. The sixcannot be treated as such a body — they were not the burgesses,but six persons selected out of them, for a particularpurpose ; namely, that one of them should be eligible to serveas reeve, and that one of them might be elected to that officeby the lord. As soon as that was effected, the purpose oftheir election was at an end, and they were resolved againinto the general body of the burgesses.A charter was granted to the citizens of Sat, who were of Bath,the merchant guild, that they might be free from toll, like t [ *the citizens of Winchester, who were of that guild.The king also granted to the citizens of Lincoln, the usual Lincoln.368 LINCOLN.-LAUNCESTON.-CORNWALL.Richard I. privilege that they should not plead without the walls ;* quittanceof murder within the city ; and the pcTt-^sokej — a tennexplained before in the charter of London, as meaning theliberty of the porte or town, which usually extended withoutthe walls. The charter also granted freedom from forcedlodgings taken by the officers of the king — from toll andamercements for money ; unless according to the law of thecitizens of London. That there should be no miskennings.That the burgh-mote should be held only once in a week : —affording a strong inference that all the inhabitants werecompellable to attend there; otherwise such a limitationwould not have been introduced for their benefit. The burgesseswere to have their lands — tenures — pledges — anddebts, &c.y according to the custom of the city. The takingof toll from the men of Lincoln was to be prevented by theinterposition of the reeoey who is mentioned twice in thecharter. All their liberties and free customs which they, orthe citizens of London have had, were confirmed to themand their heirs to hold hereditarily — rendering a rent by thereeve, for which office they were to elect whom they would.Launceston So also there is a charter to Launceston under the nameof the borough of JDunheved, granting that it should be a freeborough. That all the men, as well burgesses as others, belongingto the liberty, should be firee of toll.Cornwall. This appears to be the first grant to any borough in Cornwall: which may be worthy of observation : as it will beremembered no boroughs in that county were mentioned inDomesday, though the aid of the boroughs and towns ofCornwall, were returned in the 23rd of Henry II. : and as thischarter expressly grants that Launceston should be a freeborough, and no allusion is made to any previous privilegesor customs, the probability is, that it^vas at this time firstso created. The grant that '' as well the burgesses as othersbelonging to the liberty," should be free of toll, is probablyto be explained by considering the burgesses as those inhabitanthouseholders of the borough who were the granteesof the charter, accepted it, and were sworn and enrolled as•Car.Ant. Fen. 16. N.20.it(iRYE AND WINCHELSEA.-CANTERBURY.— NORWICH. 369burgesses under it. The " others " would be persons, who ^<^^^'^^-coming to reside, and belonging to the liberty, were subsequentlysworn and admitted. Being in substance, the sameprovision we shall so frequently meet with in the Welshcharters, which were usually granted to ^^ those inhabiting,** or who should thereafter inhabit."A grant was also made to the men of Rye, and Winchelsea, ^7^^^of freedom from toll, &c., and all custom.* "That they sea.** should be quit of all their things, and market as onr freemen: and of shires and hundreds that they do not answeror be impleaded otherwise than as the barons of Hastingsof the Cinque Ports, and as they were accustomed in the timeof King Henry our father. And for this they are to findtwo ships to perfect the number of 20 ships of Hastings.And to have all those privileges which the king's father** had granted to them."When Richard was in captivity abroad, it appears that Canterburythe neighbourhood of Canterbury being in a state of disturb ^ 'once, it had become necessary to protect the city with walls,ditches, and other defences : — as may be seen in a charterof Queen Eleanor, granted, in her son's absence, to the priorand convent of Canterbury, and which stated, — that the menof the prior and convent had worked at the walls, not as ofright or by custom, but at the instance of the queen ; suchwork done of necessity, and from the intervention of thequeen, should not affect the liberties, the prior and conventenjoyed under various grants; — a strong instance of thecaution which the ecclesiastics then exercised to protect their •privileges : and also a proof of their general exemption from .these burdens.The privileges of the citizens of London, of not pleadingwithout their walls, ail all other liberties enjoyed by them,were granted to the citizens of Norwich and their heirs; Norwich.that no stranger should dwell or take any thing by forcewithin the city. They were to choose as a reeve, whomthey would.Jewess Charters of the Cinque Ports.VOL. I. B B370 LONDON.-COMMUNAM.Richard .

Nor was it necessary ; because the aggregatebodies in towns, were allowed to enjoy all privileges,by succession, without being incorporated : — ^and in the languageof the charters of this, and succeeding reigns, hereditarily(hereditary) to them and their heirs. It could not,therefore, have been the object of this charter, to have madeLondon a corporation ; neither had it that effect. For noneRot. Cart. 11 Ed. III. n. 39, by Inspenmus.t Wilk. 343. Hovedon, 702.London-COMMONALTY. 371of the subsequent documents we shall quote respecting Richard! .London will show it to have claimed to be a corporation, orto have acted as such. On the contrary, they will negativethat position. If this had been a grant of incorporation,it is singular, that it should never after be referred tofor that purpose. That the term had no such meaning, appearsalso from its being frequently applied on occasionswhen it could not have had a corporate signification;and to bodies who could not be incorporated : as for instance,in Magna Charta, the '^ communa toties terrcs^^ is mentioned ; — Magna^^ Charta.the " communa of the wapentake of Sandford ;" — and the*' communa of the county of Buckingham"*That it had the same application in London, is evident,for in the 6th of Henry III., the mayor, in a document,speaks of thee universals communa" and ^'universitasvestra ;" and in the same year, there is a recognizance by thebailiffs, aldermen, et toties communicate Lundonise.fIn truth, the term is nothing more than the Norman appel consolationfor that which was called in Latin communitas, and inEnglish the *^ commonalty ;" and the Norman tongue beingcontinued long afterwards in this country, as the language ofthe court and the law, we find this and similar terms frequently ^used in subsequent periods. Thus, in the Constitutions ofColchester, in the time of Richard II., the ** commoners"are spoken of, instead of the commonalty.The real meaning of the word is obvious — william theConqueror had granted to the citizens of London peculiar .privileges, which they were to enjoy as a body, distinct from ^ ithe surrounding counties; which privileges were confinedand enlarged by succeeding kings — ^this was a confirmationof them, to the separate body of the citizens, under this termof" communa."

To which charter, it is not necessary fiirther to direct obser-1197. nation, except to remark, that it has been assumed by^^ some, that it gave to the city of London the conservancy ofthe river Thames ; — rather a bold assertion, as the chartergives no power, but only restricts the erection of weirs,and the interference of the keepers of the tower of London ;the provisions being in substance the same as MagnaCharta, 9 Henry IIL, cap. 33, which extends also to theriver Medway..'il94."''^v This king also granted at the same period, a charter tomouth, the burgesses of Portsmouth reciting,* that he had retainedit in his own hands ; he then grants a market and fair, and\ ^ yf^x directs, that the burgesses holding in it and of its should beyfree of toll, and of shires and hundreds j and suits of shiresand hundreds ; and to hold their mansions as the citizens ofWinchester KTiA Oxford.\ 1201. King John afterwards granted in substance the same as^ ' Richard L, and directs generally, that the burgesses should*' have the same privileges as those of Winchester and Oxford,1230. '" Henry IIL, on November 17th, in the I4th year of hisreign, also granted Portsmouth, in fee-farm, to the men ofPortsmouth, and their heirs.And the next day, the 18th of November, he grantedanother charter, similar to that of Richard L, exceptthat in consequence of the charter the day before, itomits the recital, that the king retained Portsmouth in hisown hands./ /).i>: From these grants it is obvious, that the rights and privies^ * ' leges of the burgesses of Portsmouth, continued the samefrom the 6th of Richard I. to the 14th of Henry IIL, being aperiod of 36 years ; and that the class of persons, who werethe burgesses, were the same during all that time.These charters, unlike many of the early documents, aref not altogether silent as to who were the burgesses — ^for they•I/ are described, as " holding in it and of it," Those holding\ in it, must certainly be assumed as being householders; andCart. 5, Rich.

With respect to the exemption ^from shires and hundreds, it is certain that such a privilege \could only be granted to those resident upon the spot ; becauseit was in respect of resiancy, that suit at shires and \hundreds was due — and the king could not grant total / iexemption from that suit — it must have been done some L iwhere: the fair inference therefore is, that these persons, ./who were to be exempted from doing suit at the sheriff'stom, were so in consequence of their residence within theborough — by virtue of which, they were bound to do this suitat the borough leet. This appears even more distinctly fromthe close of the charter, where the mansions of the burgessesare spoken of — a term usually applied to the houses of permanentresidents.We may therefore rely with confidence upon the inference /to be drawn from these charters, that the burgesses of ^ ^Portsmouth were originally, and within the time of legalmemory, the inhabitant householders of the place; — thatthey clearly so continued till the 14th of Henry III. has 39^^111.been already shown : and a confirmation to the burgesses,in the 39th year of the same reign, of the liberties they hadheretofore used, carries it down to that period.We shall hereafter show when the first change took place,by its being incorporated : and its subsequent submission tothe violent acts following the statute for the purging of corporations,passed on the restoration of Charles II.■ 1194.Richard 1. also granted to the burgesses of Doncaster, Doncaster.their soke, within their town at the ancient rent.*He likewise confirmed the charters which the Archbishop Beverley.of York and Henry II. had granted to the burgesses ofBeverley ; and as those were not charters of incorporation,and were confirmed within time of legal memory — ^and againby King John — it is also clear, that the burgesses of BeverleyEnrolled in the Exchequer, th Henry IV.

The men of Hereford the same.York. This king also made a grant to the citizens of York, to bequit of toll — fid that they might take distresses for theirdebts — and defend themselves, by the oaths of 36 men of thecity.It seems impossible to conceive, that these 36 men werenot to be inhabitants of the borough. Indeed, from a charterof the 46th of Henry III., the inhabitants of York are exemptedfrom juries, upon the general principle, that theyserved upon them within their own limits.In the heads of the pleas of the crown which were collectedin this reigns' there is a direction, that all the cities —boroughs — and demesnes of the king — should be tallied.This seems to be a decisive authority to show, that thedemesnes of the king were separate and distinct from thecities and boroughs. But it is probable, that some of theprivileges enjoyed by tenants in ancient demesne, weregranted by the crown to the boroughs : and from their situationbeing, in some respects, analogous, as in that abovementioned,of their being both tallied — the common, thougherroneous opinion has arisen, that boroughs were the ancientTenure, demesne of the crown ; and that, therefore, the rights ofburgess-ship depended upon tenure. The numerous quotationswe have made from Domesday, must have removedthat error, — ^this document has the same tendency.In the enumeration of the heads of the pleas of the crown,the hue and cry, and proceedings against outlaws, robbers,and their receivers are mentioned. The provisionsfor taking the oath of allegiance and obedience to theMag. Rot. 6th Richard I. 1 Rot. 4, m. 2 b. t Wilk.YORK. 376laws, and doing that suit at the court leet, were also con Richard I.tinned in full force.In the 9th year of Richard I., there was a general provisosion, that there should be one weight and measure throughoutthe kingdom ; and that it should be adopted as well withincities and boroughs, as without That no dyed cloth,except black, should be sold, but in cities and capitalboroughs.It was also provided, that in every city and borough, four,or six, lawful men of the town, according to its size, (adopt /ing the most general description, and using the language ofthe common law — but not describing them as the membersof any guild, or select body,) should, together with the sheriffor reeve of the city or borough, if they were not in the handof the sheriff, be assigned to keep the assise of weights andmeasures.The lawful men, (legales homines,) being required withincities and boroughs, to attend to the weights and measures(a duty to this moment performed by juries composed of theinhabitants of the place)— is strikingly confirmatory of thedoctrine before asserted, that the free inhabitants of theborough, sworn to the law in the court leet, were, under thecharacter of ** legales holiness the burgesses of the boroughs.The provision also, that this was to be done by the reeve, ifthey were not in the hands of the sheriff, is also confirmatoryof the position, that separate from the jurisdiction of thesheriff, was the real basis of the borough rights. And whenon any account, that separation ceased, and the boroughhad (as ought to have been the case in the instance ofOld Sarum reverted into the hands of the sheriff, then Sarum.the reeve was no longer to interpose ; but the sheriff, as theking's officer, was to superintend the due execution of theseduties.In the directions also for the collection of the talliage in 1 198.this year, the acts necessary to be performed, were to be regulatedby the bailiffs of the hundred, and the sheriff of thecounty : — which again establishes the different mode of376 IRELAND.^^^^ ^- executing duties of this description in the counties at lai^eand the more limited districts of the boroughs.Ireland. As we have thus seen that the charters and confirmationsin England, subsequent to the time of legal memory, continued,confirmed, and granted the same privileges whichwere enjoyed before that period ; and that none of themamounted to charters of incorporation: so the same factexists with respect to the cities and boroughs of Ireland —as we shall see in subsequent confirmations.John, Earl of Moreton, whilst Lord of Ireland, grantedDublin, and confirmed, in this reign, to the city of Dublin, all theliberties and privileges which were given by his father andpredecessors.*Conclusion This reign, therefore, which has brought us within thelimit of legal prescription, affords, with respect both toEngland and Ireland, in effect, the same inferences beforeextracted from documents and records of the previous periodsof our history.I There are no charters of incorporation — on the contrary,they are all granted to the burgesses and their heirs : and\ the general inference, that the burgesses were the inhabitants,presented — sworn — and enrolled at the court leet, payingscot and lot, is supported by every document — charter — ^andleal provision which can now be traced — either in the generalhistory of the country, or the local muniments of particularboroughs.Harl. MS. vol. i.JOHN.We have now advanced to the important reign of King 1199John, in which charters to the principal cities and boroughs 1216.were granted to an unprecedented extent. From this period ^commences the great roll of the charters, and we have thereforethe means of tracing them in their regular succession.All from the first year of this reign, to the end ofthat of Edward IV. are included in the " Calendars RotulorumChartarum," edited by the Commissioners of PublicRecords in 1803.The Charter Rolls contain an immense collection of grants,liberties and privileges, as well to ecclesiastical as to lay . <bodies ; and also relative to places as well in England as inthe possessions of the English crown in France. Likewisegrants to individuals of lands — protections and franchisesand of liberties and privileges to larger bodies of thepeople.On the charter rolls there are none of the 3d or 4th yearsof this reign, probably owing to the absence of the king inFrance ;— nor any of 1the 81th— 91th— 1 1th— 121th or 131th. Inthe 10th year there were only two grants affecting our pre , ^sent researches — one to Kingston, the other to Haliwerefolc ^in Durham ; the remaining 25 were private grants to individualsof markets, fairs, free warren, &c. Whether the absenceof all charters during the above years is to be attributed to theinterdict of Pope Innocent III., under which the king and thenation then lay — the actual excommunication of the king —the absolution of the oaths of fidelity and allegiance to himwith the threat of excommunication of every one who hadany intercourse with him in public or in private, requiresfurther investigation. The fact of there being no chartersgranted during those periods, is alone here material. 1In the 14th, 15th, 16th and 17th years, many other charters '^• Vide Cal. Rot. Car.378 CHARTERS.-INHAB1TANTS.John. lyre obtained from the crown. But in the 18th, the lastof the reign, none were granted to any cities, boroughs ortowns.Altogether, 77 charters to cities and boroughs appearduring nine years of the eventful reign of King John.Of those found amongst the Carts Antique, and thoseon the Charter Rolls, some are granted to the citizens — othersto the burgesses — many to the men — the honest and the freemen— there and hmfulmen — and to the good man of theboroughs ; and those to the Cinque Ports are granted to thebarons.The important question is, — ^whether one and the same classof persons were not intended by these several appellatives,or different and distinct bodies in the several towns. Onthe one hand it is said, that the grantees of these charterswere the inhabitants, with certain exceptions; on the otherit is contended, that they were select portions only of thepopulation.Inhabit ^^ exceptions to the former class are, the ecclesiastics —the servi or bond people — the poor not paying scot and lot,and new comers, not sworn, admitted or enrolled — lodgersminors — persons of incompetent mind — and females ; sothat the general word ^* inhabitants* though used for convexniece and brevity, is subject to these material exceptions,and was confined originally to the free ; but as all are nowfree, that distinction is removed, and it ought to apply to allmale inhabitant householders paying scot and lot, as contradistinguishedfrom a selected portion of persons, whetherinhabiting the place or elsewhere, who had been admitted(often ex gratis) into an exclusive corporation. Villainagehaving ceased, all persons are now of free condition : — theoriginal qualification,, therefore, of freedom, being no longernecessary as a peculiar ground of admission, should haveended • with villainage ; and the " inhabitants'' ought properlyto have been relieved from this restriction.The names applied to the grantees of these charters,have been frequently insisted upon as terms so general,that they would not admit of a partial applicants.CHARTERS.— CITIZENS.cation to any select body of the inhabitants; but such argus John.ments have generally been applied with preference only to thecircumstances of some particular place; and, in that abstractedpoint of yieWy have been deemed less conclusivethan they will be found when the charters are consideredsynthetically.This king (amongst others) made grants to the citizens of Citizens.ZtOTidan — Liju^bi — Norwich — York — Winchester — HerefordExeter f &c. ; and it is reasonable to infer, that by thatterm he intended one and the same class of persons in eachof those places; yet, in the sequel of our inquiry, it willbe found that different classes have heen^ both for municipaland parliamentary purposes considered as the citizens ofthose places; by which means the charters have in some -cases had a general, and in others a partial applicationattributed to them, though they justify no such distinction,but would lead to the conclusion, that they were all intendedto be similar. Thus the citizens of Lincoln were freemen, *elected whether resident or not. At Norwich, the freeholdersresident and non-resident; and such freemen only as wereentered in the corporation books were the citizens. At Yorkthe citizens were confined solely to the members of the corporation,who were called freemen, and were admitted bybirth, servitude, purchase or gift, whether resident or not.Exeter again included the freeholders and the freemen, whetherresident or not. And the citizens of Hereford were onlythe freemen of the corporation. Nevertheless, in each ofthese places, the grantees of the crown are described by thename of " Citizens** ^^-—^When we accurately examine the privileges granted, weshall be satisfied that they could not be restrained to thefreeholders alone; nor could that class have any peculiartitle to them.On the other hand, they could not extend to persons nonresidentwithin the cities or boroughs ; because, when oncea residence without the bounds is admitted, there is no limitto the number who might be received into the corporation.'^ W4U^cx^BURGESS£S.~R£SID£NC£.John.v.'/ •>/-'/TIt , will also appear, tha t the privileges would be incomepatible with such an unlimited power. Th us, for instance,1 the grant of freedom from toll throughout the kingdom, isI an exemption usually contained in those charters. If theenjoyment of it is limited to the inhabitant householderswithin the borough paying scot and lot, there is a reasonableground for it : — ^because, contributing to the public exigenciesJ in one place, they should be freed from such chaises inothers ; the inhabitants of which would in the same mannerpay their own burdens, and have the reciprocal benefit ofbeing discharged in other places : but if resident and nonresidentpersons could be indiscriminately admitted as freemen,and as such be entitled to exemption from toll, it isobvious that the reasonable ground and consideration for itwould no longer exist — the reciprocity is defeated — ^and anyoneplace might exercise the power of admitting non-residentfreemen to such an extent as to destroy the right to toll inall other places, and materially interfere with the dues ofthe crown — ^a proposition so absurd that it gives its ownrefutation, and requires only to be mentioned to insure itsk abandonment. We may therefore assume, that non-residentscould not have been included in such an exemption.So likewise all grants of exclusive jurisdiction, must fromtheir very nature be confined to the inhabitants ; and couldnot extend to non-residents : otherwise, by their general admissionas freemen, the king's jurisdiction might be excludedover an unlimited number of his subjects. We may generallyobserve, that all the privileges and liberties granted in thecharters we shall hereafter quote, were of a local character.The reader will also perceive that none of these charters^^'^^^J^po'^*- are grants of incorporation. It is true that many of themgive the boroughs, and other lands, at fee-farm rent.And we have already shown that such a circumstancedid not create a corporation by implication. Because suchgrants were made to men of the counties and the men and1 Petit. 23. In. Temp. Lib. Rot.

Brady, therefore, is altogetherunfounded in his assumption, that these merca- MMj»toruitrial guilds were the foundation or principal characteristicof the boroughs, and that the tradesmen belonging to themwere the free burgesses. On the contrary, it will be seen,that they were generally created subsequently to the existenceof the borough — that they were altogether separate and collateral— ^that they might, or might not, exist in it; andthat they were distinct from the municipal governmentand police; which was the great and political object of theinstitution of separate municipal jurisdictions.Brady also entertained the notions that grants of fears and ^V«fkeS?markets formed another essential characteristic of a borough.But innumerable instances might be quoted, if it were desirable,of grants to manors and inferior places, and even toindividuals ; when there was no pretence, that those placeswere ever boroughs, or the individuals to whom the privilegeswere granted, burgesses, or members of corporations.To mention two or three instances of this description,without needlessly accumulating them, there is an earlygrant to Gulfrid, the son of Peter, of a fair and market in his / /manor, of Kenebruton. Another to Fusco de Oyri, of a mar ^ -ket and fair, at Gedenay ; — to Peter, the son of William deNapier, a market at Birmingham; — and in the 1st of John,there is a grant to the templars of a house and fair atBristol: ^Extracts from some of the charters, and particularly thosewhich differ from, or illustrate each other, will be given, withcomments upon them, for the purpose of marking more disCart.

Thus it will be seen, that the charter ofHehtone grants, that the borough should be free.That of Welly that it should be a free borough, and the menfree burgesses.But it is impossible not to infer, that in all these instances,the same object was in view, although the terms or the frameof the charter, might slightly differ.It will be readily seen, that few of these charters arefor the purpose of creating boroughs. The generality ofthem speak of the burgesses, as a class of persons existing inthe place to which they were given at the time of the grant.None of them, nor those of many succeeding reigns, profess,{ i I in any degree, to provide for any election. p nmii|jLt.in n^ or admissiono f burgesses ; but leave that important part of their^ , constitution to the provisions and regulations of the commonlaw; the grants being simply to the burgesses, of whateverclass they might be. This is the only ground upon whichthe omission, otherwise most extraordinary, can be explained.It should be observed, that of the charters we shall cite,Brady has quoted some in his History of Boroughs, forthe purpose of establishing his hypothesis, that they originatedin trade ; but he was, at the time of his compilinghis book, keeper of the records in the Tower ; and if thesupposed date of the index of the charter rolls is accurate,it must have been there at the time Brady wrote. Thereader, therefore, will judge of the candour of that author,and the reliance to be placed upon him, who knowing ofall these other charters, made only a partial selection ofa few, and omitted the great majority — giving to those hequoted, a construction which cannot be supported, whenthey are compared with the others.1199. This kine granted five charters to the citizens of London,*London. ^ ^Obi. Rol.,«o. 20, n. 20. 1 Pet. MS. Inner Temple.LONDON. 383for which they paid 3000 marks. The first gave to them J«hn-the privilege, like those of Henry II. and Richard L, ofnot pleading without the walls, — quittance of murder,battle, forced lodging, toll, and lestage — and recognized *the extension of the franchise over Portsoken, the holding ofthe hustings, excusing miskenning, — and in fact confirmingthe liberties which had been granted by Henry II. andRichard I., to the citizens and their heirs hereditarily.It is therefore clear, that whatever previous grants hadbeen made to London, there had been none of incorporation —their privileges continued the same, as in the former reignsto which we have alluded ; and that the substance ofthem was an exclusive jurisdiction, and liability only to ^charges within their own limits. We shall hereafter seethat a similar grant was made to York, another of the York,cities, which at that time held a distinguished place inthe country ; and with reference to which, the observationsabove will equally apply.The citizens of London obtained upon the same day, acharter from King John, relative to the weirs upon the Weirs.Thames and Medway, precisely similar to that of Richard I.In the same year, this king granted a third charter to thecitizens of London, confirming to them the sheriff wick ofLondon and Middlesex with all customs and things belongingto it, to hold to them and their heirs paying £300 perannum, saving all their liberties and free customs. And thatthey might amongst themselves make sheriffs whom theywould, — and remove ^^Them whenever ^^They thought fit — ^^Thecitizens being liable to answer for the amercements and firmif the sheriff did not. And that for offences they should beadjudged according to the law of the city.The fourth charter by this king to London, recites, that atthe request of the mayor and citizens, he had granted thatthe guild of weavers should not from thenceforth be in the Heaven.city, nor be maintained there ; but because the king had beenaccustomed to receive from that guild 18 marks per annum,the citizens were directed by the charter to pay to the king20 marks, for a gift at Michaelmas./M» .384 LONDON.— MAYOR.John The last charter made no essential alteration in the constitutionof London ; but was a mere confirmation of the and therefore left the city in the same state asit existed before, with respect to its municipal government.The same observation applies to this charter.It is true, that it is stated to be made on the petition of theMayor. ^^ Mayor and Citizens'' a term which we have not beforefound in the charters as applied to the presiding officer inLondon, who, in the reign of William L,* was called thereeve ;) and although the mayor oi London is named in athe reign of Henry IL, yet he does not appear to bementioned in any of the subsequent grants, which aremerely to the citizens. As we have charters in the reignof William IL, Henry L, Henry IL, Richard I., and threepreceding charters by King John (two in one day), in noneof which the mayor is mentioned, it is not assuming toomuch to say,Uhat there was no charter authorizing thechange of the name from reeve to mayor: — and notwithstandingthe great importance which has been attributed to thelatter term by authors — lawyers — and even the courts oflaw — ^and parliament, there seems to have been no necessity^for a charter to change the name — ^for the office continued thesame ; and it is obvious that the alteration of the term couldmake no essential difference. For, as we have before observedthe name varied only according to the different languages from^which it was borrowed : — reeve being the Saxon term — bailiffthe French — preepositus the Latin, afterwards translated intoprovost — and maire the Norman appellation, probably borrowedfrom the Latin term mas or^^^not altogether withoutanalogy to the Saxon term for another officer, the elder orealdorman — the modem alderman : but to suppose, that anyreal distinction was intended by the use of these differentterms, or that there was such magic in the appellation ofmayor as to import a corporation, or any connection with cityseems too childish to require refutation, or even to justifyfurther comment.Prom the context of this charter it is clear, that the "GuildSee Proem. 2d. Inst. p. 6.ILondon-GUILDS.— CITIZENS. 385of Weavers'* was separate and distinct from the body of the J<>^°'citizens at large ; and that the mayor and citizens had nocontrol over them; otherwise they would not have petitionedfor this charter to suppress that body : because, if they were C .dependent upon the mayor and citizens, they could haveput an end to the guild without applying to the king. Itis equally plain, that the municipal rights of the citizensdid not, in any devisee, rest upon this guild; for had itbeen so, those rights would have been diminished by itsdestruction, for which the citizens were to pay 20 marks perannum.This instance therefore would suffice, without others,to satisfy us, as a point upon which we may rest withcertainty — that these guilds there not connected with thecitizenship of London: and if not so in this city, which wasthe great mart and emporium of trade for the whole country,is there even a semblance of probability that it was soinany other place in which trade would, comparativelyspeaking, be of less importance ? ^This king also granted, in the 16th year of his reign, anon 1214."^ther charter ;* not as before, to the citizens of London, but tothe barons of that city; that they might choose from themselvesevery year a mayor ; who was to be sworn, and whomthey might remove at the end of the year, and substituteanother in his place. The charter also confirmed to themthe liberties and privileges of the city, saving only to theking the chamberlainship.Here we have another instance of a change in the use ofa term, without any substantial alteration in the thing described.We have already shown, that all the municipal rights andliberties were in substance granted to the burgesses, whichis the general term for those who enjoy privileges distinctand separate from the sheriff: — but in cities, that same classof persons were called citizens there being no essential dis Citrons.tinction between them and burgesses. So also, in someplaces where extensive possessions were enjoyed by theRot. Cart. 16 Joh. m. 1, pars 2.VOL. I. C C,4-^* *386 BARONS.-MAYOR.-OX FORD.— LINCOLN.f \\ ^^^^' / grantees, they are called " barons," a term denoting extensivet ! landed possessions amounting to a barony. Thus we find.' in the latter part of the charter of Henry I. to London,Barons granting the county of Middlesex, the term ** barons" is usedand the same appellation was given from very early time,to the " barons of the Cinque Ports," who rendering consistdurable services to the king, had large landed possessions, toenable them to perform those duties.That the term of barons made no essential distinctionin the class of the citizens, is clear from this circumstance,that we shall find in the next reign of Henry III., a grantagain made to the *^ citizens ;" and on the same day, there isanother to the barons ; and in the 37th year of the reign ofHenry III., there is a recognition of the right of the citizens toelect a mayor, which is the privilege granted to the barons bythis charter of John. In the 62nd year of Henry III., thereis another grant to the citizens.Mayor. Express power is here given to choose a mayor, but theobject of the charter does not appear to be to authorize thecity to have such an officer, for they had one before, — but itwas to enable them to choose that officer, whom the kinghad previously appointed, and to make the election annually.This charter, therefore, in substance effecting no morethan this — leaves the citizens in precisely the same situationas they were before, both with respect to their class andprivileges.Oxford. The burgesses of Oxford gave to the king 200 marks, foraconfirmation of the liberties which they had in the timeI of King Edward, the whither of this king. And that they' might have the borough at fee-farm, with the same libertiesas the city of London.The king also granted during his reign, two charters toLincoln. Lincoln:* — the one in effect, the same as the first to thecitizens of London; which carries back the franchises ofLincoln, to the period of Henry II., the date of the grant toLondon. As we have already observed upon the chartersand liberties of that place, it is not necessary here to say moreRot. Cart. 1 Job. m. 90 ; et ib. 1 Job. m. 3, pan 2.l^iUJL^i^JiyMILJL^ Vt^tPi.Lincoln-COMMON COUNCIL. 387than that the grant to Lincohi^ in substance, gives " an exclur Jo^p*five jurisdiction ;" one privilege being that of not pleadingwithout the city, nor being obliged to wage battle, but to trythe matter according to the laws and liberties of the city ofLondon."*^ The second charter, in the same year, is a confirmationof the former ; with the addition, that the city might,by the common council elect two of the most lawful and dis Common•^ , . ' , Council.Greet citizens, who should keep the reeveship of the city ; andshould not be removed, so long as they conducted themselveswell in their bailiwick, unless by the common council of thecity. And that the citizens might, by the common council,elect four of the most lawful and discreet, to keep the pleas ofthe crown, &c.This clause, in effect, gives to the citizens of Lincoln, thepower of electing two persons, described in the languageof the common law, as lawful men, who were to fill the officeof reeve, bailiff, provost, or mayor ; and was, in substance, thesame as that granted to London, authorizing them to choosetheir mayor. But these persons are directed to be chosen bythe " common council " — a term which has been so frequentlyapplied, to support and justify the acts of select bodies incorporations,that it becomes important here to consider it.The first observation which occurs is — ^that at this time,there was not, neither in Lincoln, nor in any other place in thecountry, a municipal corporation. This charter does not createone. The term " common council," therefore, as here used,cannot mean a select body of a corporation ; on the contrary,its signification can be clearly established, by other documentsof this period. There are numerous instances, in which thisterm, as we have noted in our progress, was applied to thedeliberation or consent of any body of men :— ^-as the king didacts by the common council of the archbishops, prelates, and ,baronet The common council of the clergy — the laity —the county — the hundreds — and towns— •^re all indiscriminatelymentioned. There is, therefore, the plainest practicalapplication of this term; which these documents support,MS. In. Temp. Lib.t Mag. Char, et patentes Regis de Moneta. Wilk. 960.ccV388 Shrewsbury-WHITBY.John, instead of applying it toa state of things, which did not existat the time when it was first used ; an explanation which,if adopted, would have prevented the bewildering intricacies,in which the name has been since involved, by its modemapplication to corporate bodies.The mayor of London was to be elected by the citizens.The reeves of Lincoln in the same manner. But, adoptinglanguage which had been frequently used before, to describethe common assent of those who did the deliberative act ofelection, they are directed to make it by the common councilorassent of the citizens.These terms run through the whole of this part of the charter,as they reasonably might ; and the four lawful persons,who were to be appointed to hold the pleas of the crown, wereto be elected in the same manner — affording an instance, ofwhich we shall show many hereafter, of new terms introducedinto charters, where, the object was still the same ; though aphrase omitted in one charter, might be inserted in another.The four lawful men here appointed to administer the pleasof the crown, were, no doubt, a reduced number of the 12lage-men of Lincoln, mentioned in Domesday.Shrews Shrewsbury had granted to it, in the same year, a charter;< precisely the same as that to Lincoln ;'*^ it therefore requiresno further observation.All the liberties of Shrewsbury-were confirmed in the sixthyear of this reign.Whitby. A charter was also granted to the burgesses of Whitby,confirming all the liberties given by the abbot and church —viz. that they might hold Whitby in free burgage ; and mighthave free laws, and free acquittances, in all things to thechurch of Whitby, and the abbots and monks belonging.Whitby was not a borough in the time of the Domesdaysurvey ; but belonged, with other large territories, to Williamde Percy, brother of Scots, Abbot of Whitby. It wasmade a borough by the abbot, and confirmed by King John.But, as it never returned members to Parliament, the probabilityis, it ceased to be so before the 23rd of Edward LRot.

The hustings were to be held oncein a week, as those in London ; — and the reeve of Norwich ismentioned, corresponding with the same officer in Londonin the time of Henry IL These privileges the citizens andtheir heirs were to enjoy hereditarily. The fee-farm of wellbeingpaid by the reeve. And it was provided, that thecitizens might make the reeves out of themselves yearly —whom they might think proper, for the king and themselves.The charter to Preston grants to the burgesses all the P^s^n-liberties and free customs which Henry IL gave them — with {"\a fair, — pasture of the Forest of Flood ; and wood outof the forest, to build their houses. It must be remembered,that the inhabitants of Preston were decided to be the burgesses;although a charter of incorporation, in the usual form,was granted to them long subsequent to this period. Andthat there is no particular magic or effect in the word " freebui^ess," appears from this, that there is a grant in the sameyear to one Gospel Fitz Gospel, who is described as Sifreeburgess of Preston, meaning as appears above, that he was aninhabitant.In the successive charters to London, of Henry 11.,^ Gloucester.Richard I., and King John, we have seen the same privilegesrepeatedly granted ; and we shall have frequent occasion toobserve, that successive kings merely gave the privilegesbefore enjoyed — thus, Gloucester appears in Domesdayto have been a borough in the reign of William theConqueror. The charter of this date refers to the ancientfee-farm ; and yet it grants to the burgesses the whole borough,at the accustomed fee-farm, and 10/. of increase. Itthen proceeds to give to the burgesses of the guild-merchantRot. Carl. 1 Joh. m. 11. f Rot. Cart. 1 Job.in. 4.t Rot. Cart. 1 .roi. p. 2, m. 2.390 GLOUCESTER.— YORK.Jo^>p* the franchise — ^that none of them, should plead without thewalls, except the moneyers and ministers — ^with exemptionfrom duel, toll, &c., and lestage. The liberties of Londonwere also granted. Their ancient laws were referred to,and confirmed : — as well as the possession of their lands.And if any one took toll from the men of Gloucester, of theguild of merchants, the sheriff of Gloucestershire, or thereeve of Gloucester, was to take pledge thereof.These privileges were declared to be granted for the emendationof the city. Exemptions— and safety for foreigners,and others, who ^^ come" with their merchandise to Gloucesteroccur — and all these privileges — the burgesses and their heirswere to enjoy hereditarily.The burgesses of Gloucester, by the common council oftheir borough, were also to elect two lawful men to keep thereeveship of the borough; and four others to keep the pleas,as in Lincoln — Shrewsbury — and other places.It seems clear, therefore, that this grant was intended togive to Gloucester in substance the same privileges as hadbeen conceded to other places, though there is this varietyin the charter, that it grants some of the privileges (such asthe freedom from toll) expressly to the burgesses ofthegmldr'merchant; whilst the other liberties are to the burgessesgenerally. The reason of this is obvious: — the freedomfrom toll was useful only to those of the merchant guild ;whilst the other liberties applied generally to all the burr' gesses. It is also decisive to show, that those of the' guild-merchant were not all the burgesses and that the factof their belonging to that body no more affected their bur*less-ship than as if they had belonged to any other class —as freeholders — squires, &c.York. This king also granted, — ^as appears by inspeximus in acharter of the 36th of Henry IIL, — the town of York, withits appurtenances and liberties, at farm, to hold to the burgessesand their heirs, for 160/. annually.And by another charter granted to the citizens, alltheir liberties, laws — customs, — mercatorial guilds andhanse, and their free hostages, as they held the same in the,^'*-/SCARBOROUGH.-BEVERLEY.-IPSWICH. 39Itime of Henry I. and II. ; and by the charters of Henry II. and Jo^n-Richard I., freedom from tolls and customs.*A similar charter was granted to Scarborough, giving them Carbon ,the same liberties as the city of York, and requiring thatevery house whose gable was turned towards the highway ,f /^ / •should render to the king yearly, 4d.; and those whose ^'* ( .sides were turned towards the highway, 6d.; and thoseprivileges were also granted to the burgesses of Scarboroughand their hers*The reader will remember how frequently the gable rentoccurred among the entries in Domesday.In the same year the town of Scarborough, with the town /" / ^ W,of Wellsgrove, was granted in fee-farm to the men of Scarborough.We have seen the charters of Beverley j before mentioned]: Beverley.in the reigns of William I., Henry I., Henry IL, and /^ jRichard I.Another charter was granted in the first year of this reign n^to the men of Beverley that they should be free of toll, ^pontage, &c. saving the liberties of the city of London. Andthere is a confirmation to the burgesses of all the libertiesgranted by the archbishops of York, and confirmed by thecharters of King Henry I. and IL, and King Richard.In the fifth year of this reign, King John granted to allthe men settled throughout Holiness, privileges respectingthe holding of their lands of the church of Beverley as theywere wont to do before. ,The king also immediately upon his ascending the throne, Ipswich,for he succeeded to the crown on the 5th of April, and on the f\ ,25th of the next month he granted to the burgesses of -'Ipswich, the borough, which we have seen existed at thetime of the survey of Domesday, with all its appurtenances,liberties and free customs, to be holden by them and theirheirs hereditarily, at the accustomed fee-farms, &c.; 100^.over and above what they used to pay, to be rendered bythe hand of the reeve or provost. It was also granted thatRot. Cart. I Job. pars 2, m. 20. t Rot. Cart. 1 Job. pars 2, m. 21.{ Hot. Cart. IJoh. pars 2, m. 5./392 IPSWICH.^^^^' the burgesses should be quit of toll, &c. — ^that they shouldnot plead out of the borough — ^that they should have a merchantguild — that nobody should take forced lodgings withinthe borough — that they should hold their lands — pledgesand dues; — and as to their tenures, that right should bedone them according to the customs of the borough ofIpswich and of the hinges free boroughs, to which referenceis twice made. The burgesses of Ipswich were to hold all theirliberties and free customs as the other free burgesses ofthe free boroughs of England, saying the liberties and freecustoms of the citizens of London. The provisions in thecharters of Lincoln, Norwich, and other places, that thereshould be two lawful persons elected by the common council ofthe town for the reeveship of the borough, and four lawfulmen to keep the pleas of the crown, — ^were repeated with respect,to Ipswich.*Freedom from toll was enjoyed even in late times inall ports of the kingdom by those masters of ships who werefree of the borough, decisively proving, as we have observedbefore, that the power of making freemen could not be un-inhabitantslimited ; for if it were, the burgesses of any borough mighty- defeat the rights of other places to toll, and of the kingto his dues; by making all who desired it, free of theiri borough: — and therefore it is clear, that this exemptionI could not have been intended to be communicated to any butthe actual inhabitants.The same observation may be applied to the exemptionfrom pleading without the walls : — for otherwise the king'sjurisdiction might be excluded over an unlimited number of'* his subjects.As Ipswich was a borough at the time of Domesday, it iscertain that this grant of a merchant guild could not, asMerchant " Brady" supposes, have made it a borough. And it appearsclearly from the directions in the charter, that as the burgessesof Ipswich, were to enjoy the same privileges as otherfree boroughs, it was assumed that all their privileges wereCar. Ant. £. £. m. 31. f Car. Rot. 2 Joh. pars I, m. 34*IPSWICH. 393alike. The same provision also occurs in the charter of Hun John,kingdom, in the seventh year of this reign.In consequence 6f the ancient documents relative' to thisborough, haying been carefully preserved, we are enabled tolearn precisely and practically what was done upon the grantingof this charter; for there was a transcript preserved of a roll,made in Ipswich, about 13 months after this date, describingthe state and government of the town. Perhaps the shortinterval before this document was made, occurred from thefine due upon the granting of the charter not being paid tillsome time afler ; a circumstance by no means unusual atthat period, as may be seen by the oblata roll.It is thus entered: — ^^The whole tom being assembledin the burial ground of St. Mary, to elect two bailiffs, andfour coroners, according to the charter then lately grantedby King John — It was ordained, that there should be 12capital portmen, swam in manner as they are in other free Twelveboroughs in England. — that they should have full power for Penmen.themselves, and the whole town, to govern and maintain theborough, and all the liberties of the same; — ^to renderjudgment of the town; — ^to ordain, and do all things in theborough, which ought to be done for its state and peace.The whole town to assemble in the burial ground, after thefeast of St. Peter and Paul, next coming, to elect the said 12capital portmen.On which Sunday, the whole town accordingly met beforethe bailiffs and commoners to elect the said 12 capital port-men,and the bailiffs and coroners by the assent of the town,elected four good and lawful men, of every parish of the town,who were sworn to elect 12 capital portmen, of the most discreetand. worthy of the town, to ordain for its state. And12 persons were elected accordingly, and sworn before thewhole town, well and faithfully to keep and govern the borough,and to maintain the liberties, granted by the chartersof the king, and all other liberties, and free customs, andjustly to render the judgments of the courts, without havingrespect to any manner of persons, and to ordain, and doall other things, which were needful for the state and peace394 IPSWICH.Jobs, of the town, and justly and lawfully to treat as well thepoor as the rich.As soon as they were sworn, they caused the whole ofthe tovons-fM to stretch their hands towards the book, andwith one voice, solemnly to swear, that henceforth they willbe obedient, intending, consulting, and aiding to their bailiffs,coroners, and the capital portmen, with their persons andchattels, to preserve and maintain the town, and the newcharter y and the honour, and all the liberties, and firee customsof the town, in all places, against all persons whomsoever,serving nevertheless to the lord the king, and his royal prerogative,as they ought to do.The new charter was delivered to two good and lawful menof the town, to safely keep : — ^who were sworn faithfully to do so,and deliver it to the township, whenever it should be necessary,and when it should be wanted aid required so to do on behalfof the town. Another meeting was appointed for the Thursdayof the feast of the translation of St. Thomas the Martyr,next ensuing, of the bailiffs coroners and capital portmen,to ordain what should be meet for the state and honour of thetown.They accordingly assembled, and ordained : — -That the customs should be collected by the bailiffs, andgood men of the borough, who should yearly pay into theking's exchequer, the right and accustomed farm of the town.That there should be two beadles to execute attachments,&c., and precepts : — and that one of them should keep allprisoners.si* That by the com$noncouncil of the town, there should be madeone common seal in the borough, to serve in weighty businesses,touching the commonalty ^ and to sign letters thereupon,for testifying the truth of all and singular the burgesses of theborough, and to do all other things which ought to be done forthe common peace and utility of the town. The seal to bekept by three or four good and lawful men of the borough,thereunto sworn before the commonalty. That there should be^of *the"* ^^^^*^ ^y *^® common council of the town, one good, lawful,Guild, and fit man, who should be a/e2erma»o/*Me^£/c^merchant ^^in"IPSWICH. 396the borough, and that four good and lawful men, should be J**^"-associated with him ; and that the alderman and such four,should be sworn well and faithfully to maintain the aforesaidguild, and all things which to the guild pertained.That the new charter should be sent into the full countycourt of Suffolk, and into the full county court of Norfolk,and should be openly read in the same county courts, in orderthat the liberties of the said charter might be known andobserved.On the same day, it was granted by all the commonalty y atthe request of the 12 capital portjnen, that for the labourwhich they should bestow on behalf of the comnumalttfy theyshould have the Odin meadow, for the support of theirhouse.Also it was ordained, and agreed hy the whole commonalty,that the laws, and free customs of the town, should be put in aroll, which should be called the Doomsday : — ^and that such i>ooiMdaj.roll should always remain in the custody of the four for the '^time being, that they might hear and understand in whatmanner they ought to act in their office.That all the statutes of the guHd-merchant, should be put ^G<ul(l-in a certain other roll, in manner as are elsewhere used in citiesand thoroughly where there is a guild-merchant, — and that thealderman should always have such roll in his possession, thathe might know how to act in his office.Inasmuch as divers religious persons, and their tenants, ReligiousPfirsoDsclaimed to be more free and quit of toll in the town ofIpswich than they used in times past, it was commandedby the bailiffs aforesaid, that a, good inquest of24goodfnenand lawful be made, to come and inquire how and in whatmanner they ought to be quit — and that the inquisition bebefore the bailiffs on Thursday next afler the Feast of St.Luke next ensuing.On Sunday next after the Feast of St. Dionysius, in thesame year, the Prior of the Holy Trinity in Ipswich becamea bui^ess; and he gave to the commonalty 20s, in aid of theexpenses rohich were incurred in obtaining th new charter.And to the house of the town guild one quartern of wheat,^396 IPSWICH.^^^^ and one boar. And was sworn to maintain the liberties of theScot and town, and to be at scot and lot, as a resident burgess.The Prior of St. Peter in Ipswich, gave to the commonaltyone mark, — ^and to the guild a coomb of wheat, and twowethers.On Thursday next after the Feast of St. Luke, in the 2ndyear of the reign of King John, the bailiff of Ipswich madean inquisition by twelve good and lawful men of the sametown, stating how and in what manner the aforesaid religiouspersons, who had lands and tenements in the country inthe neighbourhood of the said town, ought to be quit oftoll of the same town, and say upon their oath, that themen of the Archbishop and Prior of Canterbury were quit oftoll in the said town of Ipswich, for all their things whichgrow and renew in the fee of the church of Canterbury only,and also for all their own things bought for their own use,and not otherwise ; and this is testified by the writ of thelord the king. But for their merchandises bought and soldas merchants, they have always paid their custom towardsthe firm of the lord the king, and so they ought to pay.Norwich.

And it must be remarked,^that the commonalty have ever since acted in Ipswich ; — ^thatin the reign of Edward III. they joined in the election of themembers to Parliament, and afterwards partook in that right.It is then directed, that there should be twelve capitalportmen in the manor, as they are in other free boroughs inEngland. The meaning of the term portmen, being, in fact, Portmen.'' the men of the town ;" and there being no previous electionor nomination of them, as burgesses 4t is clear, that themen of the town, or the inhabitants there, were treated as ini^wtani*the burgesses. We find that these ordinances, like thecharter, describe the election and swearing of these twelvecapital townsmen as usual in other free boroughs. And asother fine boroughs had, by the law of the court leet, juries —whose duty it was to do the acts here presented for the 12portmen — it is obvious, that these persons being sworn,were the jury for the year, in the same manner as the "juratsof the cinque ports."The whole town, who elected these persons, are called the ^f ™™**"*^ commoners and the " commonalty' and the election is bythe assent of the town : — ^they are stated to be sworn in bythe whole town ; and a part of their oath is, that they shouldjustly render the judgments of the courts of the town. Bythe common law, the only courts at which all the peoplewere bound to be present, were the sheriff's tom in thenews.V\\aAMx^ Ut'Ua^ c^^-400 IPSWICH.John., county at large; and the court leet in the boroughs. And asall the town are said to be present, it may be assumed, thatthis was the court leet; particularly as the whole of thetownsfolk are stated to be swam there, — which could onlybe legally done in that court.The persons who concur in the election of the portmen,and those to whom the charter was delivered, are described,in the language of the common law, a$ good and lawful menof the town. And it must not be forgotten, that the port-menelected are appointed by the whole town, and have onlya delegated authority from them — ^which it is in the powerof the body who created them, at any time to withdraw.Practically speaking, our nature almost requires it —considering the uncertainties of health — the difficulties oftime and space — the numerous avocations of mankind — thatlarge bodies should act through smaller, selected and delegatedby them; — and therefore, such an election as thisspecified in the Ipswich roll, was necessary to carry thecharter into effect. But the whole utility, confidence, andlegality, attending their appointment, rests upon their havinga delegated, and representative and not an original authority.A power capable of being put an end to, if abused :a power responsible to those who gave it: — in short,a power resembling in substance, though not in name,those select bodies which, in modem language, are calledcommittees ; and which the good sense and practical experienceof mankind, have found to be essentially necessary, forcarrying into effect the intentions of large segregate bodies.This gives a plain solution of the principles upon whichsuch bodies were originally appointed ; and falls in with thefeelings and habits of mankind — and not practically opposedto them, like the self-elected common councils of corporations,assuming to act from an original, and not a delegatedauthority.The ordinances made by these portmen, were for the practicalgovernment of the town. They speak expressly of the.assent of the whole town, as the common council: they speakof the '* commonalty' and of the aldermen — of the guild andIpswich-MERCHANT GUILD. 401the men of the guild, — as including only a part of, and sepa- Jo^i^-rate from, the whole body of the burgesses and commonalty.There can be no doubt, that the commonalty and the 12portmen were not the same body — the latter being selectedfrom the former, and distinct from them; though by theerroneous statements of some writers, particularly Brady,and the perverted usages of many places — such select bodies,and the commonalty at large, were often confounded together.But here it appears that they were separate, for the portmenrequested from the commonalty an allowance for the labourwhich they had in their behalf: and the regulations weremade by the consent of the who commonalty.The separation also of the guild-merchant from the gene w^"|}^"oral body of the burgesses, is shown by the directions, thattheir statutes were to be kept distinct from those of the borough— ^which is stated to be the manner adopted elsewhere,in cities and boroughs where there were guild-merchants.The regulations with respect to exemption being en Scot andtoyed by religious persons and the villains of abbots andpriors — are precisely in unison with the doctrine we havebefore laid down ; as well as the fine paid to the commonstock, towards the expense of obtaining a new charter,whenever a person became a burgess, who is expresslydirected to pay scot and lot : — ^and as it might be a questionwhether the prior, though residing in Ipswich, or within thelimits of it, might not be considered within its jurisdiction,as he lived upon an ecclesiastical fee, it was declared thathe was to pay scot and lot, as a resident burgess. And in thequestion, as to the exemption of the men of the templars,and others, they were distinctly described, in the language ofthe common law — as dwelling and resiant upon the fee.The persons made burgesses, who were to contribute tothe common stock of the borough, appear to have been connectedby property with the place ; and probably were residentthere. At all events it seems that it was in considerationof their rendering their custom to the farm of the town, —in effect paying scot and lot, — ^that they and their villains '-were to be quit of toll.VOL. I. o D402 DUNWICH.-MERCHANT GUILD.John. Iq the same year of this king's reign, a charter was alsoDuDwich. given to the burgesses of Duninrich, granting that it should beafree borough ; and have soc and sac, toll, them, and in-fangthef.That the burgesses should be free of toll, lastage, andpassage, &c. ; with all other customs, saving the liberty of thecity of London. That they should render their accustomedfarm by their own hand. That they should do no suit of countiesor hundreds J unless before the king's justices. Andwhen summoned before them, they might send for themselves12 lawfid men of their borough who might be for them all.And if by chance they ought to be amerced, they should beamerced by six just men of their own borough, and by sixhonest men without the borough.That their sons and daughters might freely marry wherethey willed — and widows in the same manner, by the counselof their friends.That they might give or sell their purchases of lands andbuildings in the town, or do therewith what and when theywilled.And ako might have a hanse and guild-merchant, as theymight have been accustomed.Merchant This charter is quoted by Brady, and inserted in hisAppendix, to support his doctrine — of the guild being theorigin of the borough ; but it does not appear to have had thateffect ; for the making it a free borough was separate anddistinct from the grant of the hanse .and the guild, as wehave before observed with respect to many other places.It would seem that this grant did not make it a borough,because the burgesses were mentioned in Domesday,as having existed in the time of King Edward; and thecharter was given to the burgesses as an existing body.The effect of it in all probability, was only to release themfrom their tenure of the king, and from the services incidentthereto; upon their payii^ the fee-farm, which was reserved.Juries. The 12 men by whom they were allowed to appear, seem tobe analogous to the 12 portmen of Ipswich : — and unless weSee Brady's Appendix, 13. Rot. Cart. 1 Joh. m. 8.Munich. 403are to assume that this gave to these two boroughs, a privies J<>^"*lege which London, and the other larger cities of the kingdomdid not possess, — ^we must conclude that this was a commonright, though it has been in these instances particularly expressed; and the most reasonable inference would be, as wehave drawn with respect to Ipswich ; — ^that these 12 men werethe jury of the court leet for the time being, like the jurats ofthe Cinque Portly and other places in Kent. A farther confirmationof which position may be found in the fact, that inthe reign of Henry V., many of the returns to Parliamentwere made in the county courts by the juries, as deputationsfrom the different boroughs.The marriage of the sons, daughters, and widows, appearsto be a more dilated provision for the liberties which weregranted to the " bui^hwara " of London, by William I. : — ^andthe liberty to dispose of their lands, corresponds with thesame charter, the Saxon Laws, and the numerous entriesto which we have referred in Domesday.This king also granted a charter to Dunwich, in the 1206.seventh year of his reign, remitting to the burgesses some c^JJ^,.arrears of fee-farm, upon condition that they should renderan account of it for the future; and adding the grant respectingpledges, which we have met with so frequently in othercharters.* All their privileges are given to them and theirheirsy which shows, contrary to Brady's supposition, thatthey were not incorporated either by the grant of the boroughatfee-farmy or by that of the guild-merchant.In the 17th year of this reign, a third charter was granted ]216.by this king to Dunwich.f It was a confirmation, for their chwter.faithful services, to the honest men of Dunwich and theirheirs, of the borough at free burgage, and of the merchantguild, with hanse, and other customs and liberties to thatguild belonging, j: •That it should be lawful to them in their burgh, totake bail of their debtors, and pledges of all debts whichshould be owed to them. That they should never plead, or be• Rot, Cart. 7 Joh. m. 6. t Rot. Cart. 17 Job. m. 8.t 1 Petit. MS. 18, In. Temp.

If the native of any man should have dwelt in the borough,and held land there ; and should have been in the guild andhanse, and in scot and lot with the same burgesses, by a yearand a day, then he should not be reclaimed by his lord, butshould remain free in the same borough.*Sac, soc, toll, them, and infangthef, were also granted ; —that they and their men, with their chattels and ships,and all their things and possessions should be free frommurder and lestage, passage, pontage, stallage, danegeld andgaywigte — ^and all other customs and exactions, as wellin England, as in all other the king's lands. That theyshould be free to marry their daughters, whenever theycould and would, without the license of any one ; and thatno one should have any power to marry them but by theirconsent; neither in the lives of their fathers, nor aftertheir decease; and that nobody should have the custodyof their sons or daughters, or heirs of their lands, or goods,but their proper parents and friends, or those to whom theyhave themselves provided and assigned the custody.That none of their sons or heirs should be obliged to marrybut at their will, and that their widows might be in theirproper gift, and at their proper will. " That they might freelybuy and sell when they would, and appoint whomsoever theywould their heir ;" with a confirmation to them and their heirs,of all the liberties they had been accustomed to enjoy — andwhich any of the cities or boroughs had either in England orinany other of the king's lands.Netting This king also confirmed the free customs, which NottinghamGlanville and Nottingham, before.NOTTINGHAM.Aom had in the time of Henry I. and Henry II., with thetolls for passing over the Trent, which probably arose fromtheir having originally had the keeping of the water of that V ^river, as mentioned in Domesday. — Directions were also givenrespecting the carts and pack-horses, and dying of cloths.And a provision occurs respecting villainy in spirit the ^'i*!'"'**-same, as the passage in Glanville to which we have beforeso particularly referred ;* the clause was in the followingwords :Ii any one (from what place soever he be) shall dwell inthe borough of Nottingham one year and one day, in time ofpeace, and without claim, no person afterwards but the kingshall have right over him.After which succeed the following clauses :And whoever of the burgesses should buy the land of his Bujogneighbour, and possess it by one whole year and one day, withoutclaim of the kindred of the seller — ^if they should be inEngland — should afterwards quietly possess the same ; norbefore the reeve should any one of the burgesses be made toanswer to the claimant, unless he should be an accuser inthe cause.And whosoever should dwell in the borough, of what fee Resiants.soever he might be, he ought to pay talliages, together withthe burgesses, and supply the deficiencies of the borough.Also, all those who should come to the market of Nottingham,from the Friday evening to Saturday evening, should notbe distrained, except for payment of the king's farm ; and thepassage of the Trent ought to be free to navigators as har asthe extent of one perch on both sides of the midstream.The king also granted and confirmed the guild-merchant ywith all the liberties and free customs which to a guild-merchantappertain ; and that they be quit of toll.And that it should be lawful for the burgesses to make for Reeve,their reeve whom they would, from themselves at the end ofthe year ; who should answer for them as to the farm ; so that,if the same reeve displeased the king, he would remove him athis will, and they should substitute another at the king'spleasuresSee Glanville. t Rot.

Xhe reader will observe, that the right of the kiii^ cnrerhis villain is here preserved, upon the ground, that '' anlinmtempus occurrit regi ;^' upon which we have commented before,on the passages in Glanville, where the entire freedomof the villain was made to depend on the charters of theking : accounting for reliance for a year and a day banglimited to a privileged place ; that is, a place under a king'scharter. And it should be remembered, that this would betheeffect of all those charters, whether expressed or not.Therefore this clause is only another instance of a specialand express provision in a charter, of a matter which isomitted in others, but tacitly implied in all : so that, althoughthey vary in form, they are in substance the same.The provision in this charter — that those who differ in theborough, of whatever fee they are, should contribute with theburgesses — is in conformity into the frequent comments wehave made upon the passages ufw^Scbtneburgesses belongingto other manors were stated to be resident in the boroughs.This king also granted a confirmation of the charter of'*^""**" Henry Into Newcastle^pon-Ikfne: and also another charter^^ for the liberty of buying and selling dyed cloths, which they1200. had before enjoyed in the reigns of Henry I. and Henry 11.with the town at fee-farm to the burgesses.1213. And by another charter in the 14th year of his reign, hegranted again to his good men of iVetoco^^fe-t^xm-iyne, andtheir heirs, the town, and all its appurtenances, at the fee-farmof 1002., and also 110^. and 6d. rent in the same town,of escheats; — ^to be divided and assigned to them who had losttheir rents by occasion of the ditch and new works madeunder the castle toward the water, so that they might havemore who had lost more, and less who had lost less. Also thatthey should be answerable in nothing to the sheriff or constableof these things which belong to them ; — wherefore the kingwilled that they should enjoy those things, vrith all libertiesand free customs which they had been accustomed to havein the time of King Henry, saving the liberty of the town ofLondon.*The fee-farm, which was originally 50/., King John, inRot Cart. 14 Joh. m. 2.NEWCASTLE-UPON-TYNE. 407the 2d year of his reign, raised to 60L, and it is here in- decreasedto los.*The exemption from the jurisdiction of the sheriff andthe constable is limited to their own things — as the freedomfrom tolly &c. is limited in the prior charter of the 9th ofFebruary 1201—2 John.This king also, by another charters dated in the 17th year 1216.of his reign, granted to his burgesses of Newcastle-upon-Tyne,and to their heirs for ever, that none of them should be distrainedout of the same town, to pay to any one, any debt forwhich he was not chief debtor or surety — ^that none of themshould be tried by battle — ^that they should be allowed totraverse in pleas of the crown, according to the ancient customof the city of Winchester — ^that none of them should be judgedof misericordia money, but according to the old law ofWinchester, which they had in the time of the king's ancestors— ^that they should hold justly their lands and tenures,and all their mortis and debts, from whosoever should owethem ; and that right should be held with them, concerningtheir lands and tenures within the town, according to thecustom of Winchester — that pleas should be held in Newcastle,concerning all their debts lent in Newcastle, and allmortgages there made. The king further granted, for the improvementof the town — ^that all should be quit of gersummeand scotale ; so that no sheriff, or any other bailiff, shouldmake scotale withui the same borough. If, however, thosecustoms had been unjustly levied in the time of war, theyshould be altogether annulled. And any persons, from whateverplace they might be, whether foreigners or others, whoshould resort to the borough with their merchandise, shouldcome, remain, and depart, in the king's peace, paying the duecustoms.The charter, in conclusion, confirmed to them and theirheirs, all other liberties and free customs, given before by theking's ancestors to them and their A^tr^. j;This grant to the burgesses and their heirs ; like thoseobserved upon before, expressly gives the exemptionsHot.

The King also gave a charter to the burgesses of Cambridge: — ^who were to have their town at fee-farm, with suchliberties as the free demesne boroughs of the king, havingliberties, enjoyed.Grimsby. A similar grant was made to the burgesses of Grimsby,Stafford. And to the burgesses of Stafford and their heirs That itshould be a free borough, with sac and soc — freedomfrom toll, suits of shires and hundreds and all other freecustoms of the free boroughs of England.

And although in1660, a committee of the House of Commons declared theinhabitants at large to be the burgesses of Helston ; yet, in inhabitants1774, the freemen were considered to be the burgesses: —which, under the doctrine, that a person being once free, isalways free, and continues so, although he resided elsewhere,let in the non-residents as burgesses, in defiance of theexpress provisions of the charter, and the formerdecision.A grant was also made to Marlborough reciting as before, Martinthe charters to Portsmouth, that the king had retainedit in his own hands; and granting a fair and market;— /«and that the borough and all the men in it, and tenants of it, |dwelling there, and their heirs, should be free of toll, &c., with jsoc and sac, &c., and a mercatorial guild, like the citizens of \Winchester. It is obvious that the tenants of the boroughdwelling in it, must have been householders : — ^thus explainingthe passage we have before seen in the charter of Portsmouth; although in that case the terms ^' dwelling there"were not expressly introduced.* ^This king also granted to the burgesses of Canterbury j\ a canterburymercatorial guild ; and that none of them should be impleadedwithout the walls, nor make duel. That the pleas of thecrown should be disclaimed, according to the ancient customof the borough ; and all the burgesses of the mercatorial guildshould be free of toll, &c. ; that none should be adjudgedin mercy of money, unless according to the ancient customof the borough, which they had in the times of the king'sancestors. And if any take toll or custom from the men of *the mercatorial guild, the reeve should take namium thereof.A fair is then given, with a confirmation of all their previouscustoms. *J^There is a charter to the burgesses of SaZM6wry,t granting to Salisbury. /them a mercatorial guild ; and that they might be as free of toll, ; /as the burgesses of Winton , who were of the mercatorial guild. tAlso a peculiar charter granted to the men oi Andover,Rot.

This view of the grant is much confirmed,by its providing, not generally, that the men there shouldhave the same privil^es as the burgesses of Wintan ; but thatthey should have the privileges of the burgesses of Winton*who are in the mercatorial guild' they being separate, asbefore noted, from the general body of the burgesses ofWinchester.It will also be recollected, that we have shown a stronginstance to the same point, in the reign of Henry II., respectingTotness.Many grants were also made to other places, which it willbe sufficient cursorily to mention.aston Freedom fix>m toll was confirmed to the burgesses ofSouthampton.Appleby.

For theburgages of Hedon, were expressly mentioned in this firstcharter, with a reference also to the burgage tenure of Yorkand Lincoln : — ^and yet all these places, have had a corporateright of election established in them : — whilst, in other places,where there were no such direct traces of burgage tenure — thatright has been, adopted. The truth is, that all boroughs wereheld in burgage tenure and therefore, that right ought to haveprevailed every where, if at all.The same may be observed of Liverpool, which had in this Liverpool,reign, a charter granted to it, providing, that all the king's subjects,who had taken burgages at Liverpool, should have allthe liberties and free customs, in the town, which any free boroughupon the sea hath.fIf burgage tenure, was a real ground of burgess-ship, itought to have prevailed in Liverpool : — but a corporate righthas always existed there. If the burgage right, is properly excludedfrom Liverpool — considering this charter — it ought notto prevail any where.That exclusive right, therefore, seems clearly untenable.But if the doctrine is adopted for which we contend, " thatthe inhabitant householders were the real burgesses," — ^then,^^The whole is reconciled — ^^The law of burgage tenure, appliesto the houses held by the householders: — the corporationconsists of the householders, who have been admitted,sworn, and enrolled at the court leet, according to thecommon law : — and thus the burgesses, who ought to havereturned members to Parliament, and to have enjoyed all the• P. 150.t Rot.

A charter was granted at this time, to Wells making it afine borough, and directing, that all the men of the town, andtheir heirs should be free burgesses!: As Wells does notappear to be a borough in Domesday, nor is there any otherdocument to show that it was so before this time, we mayinfer that this was the charter of its creation as a borough,it having been previously an ecclesiastical possession, in thehands of the bishop.Hunting. Brady affirms, that the charter of Huntingdon, which wasa mere grant of the borough at fee-farm, made it a borough :but he is clearly mistaken in that respect, because Huntingdon was returned as a borough in Domesday, and thecharter of this reign, was only a confirmation and did not,like this of Wells, make it a fi'ee borough. And there were alsosimilar grants in this reign to other places, not making themSandwich, fi'ee boroughs, thus to Sandwich :% — ^which was not mentionedas a borough in Domesday ; and by inspeximus in a charter ofEdward III., in the 38th year of his reign, it is recited — ^thatPet.

From this time they containa regular chronicle of events ; yet, so far as can bediscovered, no original charter for the election of a mayornor inspeximus has been found.Abridge. Abridge, which was a borough in the time of Domesday —but has never sent members to Parliament — was in thisyear granted to the Archdeacon of Wells,* with Chesterand the hundreds of Wintertime and Chester, with amarket and fair, sac and soc ; that the tenants were notto be put on juries; acquittance of shires and hundreds ; —and the sheriff not to intromit. With other provisions, as tomurder — pleas of the crown — prisoners — ^and the dues of theking, which it is not necessary more particularly to enumerate.There were also grants to other places, which were boroughshaving burgesses : but, never having returned members to Parliament,it may be assumed they ceased to be boroughs beforethe duty of sending representatives devolved upon that classof towns: — ^thus CorbridgefwBS granted eli fee-farm to the burgesses— and a similar charter to Roberts and Newbum; and toth&vcLQiiot Hartlepool that they should be free burgesses, withthe same liberties and laws as the burgesses of Nfiwcasth.There were also at this period, several instances of manorsgranted at fee-farm, as Odiham^ — Pickering — Scalesby^*Pokelingtonff — Driffold.XtSCOTLAND.As we have seen that the charters of this reign continuedin their essence and substance the same as those in the pre-fromthe Corporation Records, and see also Rot.

We find thelike grants in Ireland.IRELAND.King John, who as Earl of Moreton, during the reign ofRichard I., had granted a charter to Dublin, in the 2d year Dublin.of his own reign, gave another to the citizens and theirheirs as well those dwelling without as within the walls, asfar as the bounds of the city and liberty. It described themeres and bounds of the city ;* — and granted the tenureswithin and without the walls, to be disposed of by the consentof the citizens in free burgage by the service of laudable,and to be held according to the custom of the city; —m both of which we found so many instances in Domesday.As a corporate right of election has prevailed in Dublin, itsbeing held by burgage tenure must be subject to the sameobservations we before made with respect to Liverpool.The charter also granted the same privileges as those givento London by Henry II. and Richard I. — that they shouldnot plead ^without the walls — ^with acquittance of murderand forced lodgings — freedom from tolls — and that no citizenshould be amerced unless according to the laws of the hundred.The hundred court — analogous to the hustings in thecities of London and Norwich — was to be held weekly — ^mis-kenning in it was excused — ^with the usual provision asto debtors — pledges — and foreign merchants : — with thispeculiar provision, that they were not to sell wine by retail,but on ship-board.

The church was to be free — all theirliberties were granted to the freemen — and the distinctionbetween them — the liberi homines — and the villains — towhich we have so frequently referred from the commencement.\ ^ * "of our researches, was repeatedly recognized in the course of^'f i the charter.The right of inheritance — the custody and marriage ofsons — daughters — and widows, were regulated — as well asclaims for debts, and pledges.1 The merchants were protected in buying and selling intheir journeys — and in their sales and purchases, accordingto the ancient rights and customs, without any bad tolls.A special provision was made for the talliages and aids,^ liberties and customs, of the city of London, with all othercities, boroughs J towns, and the Cinque Ports.It was also expressly provided, that the city of Londonshould have its ancient customs and free liberties.I <The pledges given for offences and usurpations in theforest were mentioned, and directed to be amended by 15knights, who ought to be chosen by the good men of thecounty.The king was to make justices, constables, sheriffs andbailiffs, of such as knew the law, and were willing to observeit.The restoration of the property in Wales which had beenseized is provided for — as well as the rights of the King ofScotland.The distinction between the clei^ and the laity was observedin this charter; — and the former were to be amercedonly according to their lay tenements.It was also expressly provided — that no county court shouldrMAGNA CHARTA. 421be held for the future except from month to month ; nor Jq^"*should the sheriffs or his bailiff, make his tom through thehundred, except twice in the year ; and only in the accustomedplace, at Easter and Michaelmas. So also the viewof frank-pledge should be held there, but that every oneshould have his liberties which he had and ought to have,in the reign of King Henry II. ; — affording the reason forthe commencement of le&cal memory in the first year of ,Legal.° •' •' Memory.Richard I.* ^The charter then proceeds, almost in the words of theSaxon laws, that the " view offhand-pledge" shall be so madethat the king's peace might be preserved, and that the tithingbe whohy as it used to be.The Great Charter contains a considerable portion of theprovisions previously granted to particular places, — such asthat their heirs should inherit ; — the custody, and marriageof sons, daughters, and widows ; — assise of wine ; — dispositionof intestate' property; — forfeitures for theft; — andparticularly the holding in burgage as a species of socagetenure, was expressly recognized.That we may not altogether pass over any public documentsof this reign, from which we might discover theusage and practice of that period — ^we would observe, thatin the regulations of the assise for money, in the 6th year ofKing John, it was directed — ^that certain inquests of offencesrespecting coin should be made by the free and lawful men Free andin the cities, boroughs, and towns ^' per liberos et legales ho men.mines'* The same class of persons — being of free condition,and sworn to the law in the court leet — to whom we have sofrequently referred as the burgesses.In the 6th year of this reign we find an entry — in conformitywith the Saxon laws — relative to the flight of tenmalefactors : and a person who had received an outlaw intohis house, and made himself a companion of him, wasamercedAnd see post., p. 432, Confirmation of Henry 11 1 .t Hot. 2. MS. in. Temp. Lib./422 HEIRS.— SUCCESSORS.'^°^°' We ought cursorily to observe, that King John upon hisrecall of the exiled clergy swore, amongst other thingsthat he would restore all the laws of his ancestors, and-particnlaxly of King edward : — and would revoke all unjustlaws.Again at St. Allan's, — the king ordained that the lawsof Henry I. should be observed throughout the kingdom, —that all unjust laws should be altogether annulled ; — alsocottages — so frequently the subject of specific exemption inthe local charters.Conclusion We have now collected and commented upon such documentsas we have thought necessary and material duringthis important reign ; and after having considered the chartersminutely, it is unnecessary to add any further observation, *meeting the recollections — that all the boroughs are foundedupon their separate jurisdictions resulting from their exemptionsfrom suits of shires and hundreds: — and throughoutthe whole of this reign there is no trace of a corporation — butall the charters were granted to the burgesses and their heirs.And if there were no municipal corporations — ^which is mostclear, during those two reigns of Richard I. and King John —then, even without the additional documents and argumentswhich we shall produce hereafter, it will have been indisputablydemonstrated, that there can be no municipal corporationsby prescription — nor prescriptive corporate rights.We have observed, throughout our quotations from thecharters, that they were granted to " the burgesses and theirheirs;" there is no instance of any — ** to them and their successors:" — ^a strong proof of the doctrine of corporations notbeing at that time applied to burgesses; particularly asthe mode of taking in succession was by no meansSacceuon. Unknown, or the terms ^^ successors " unused, at that period.They were frequently adopted during this reign with re-/• terence to ecclesiastical property and persons. Thus inthe first year of King John, there was a charter granted tothe church of Christ Church Canterbury, the archbishopand their successors ; the term occurring three times in the/'CONCLUSION. 423charter.* In the eighth year of. his reign there was another Jq^°'grant to the archbishop and his successors ; the term beingtwice expressed in the charter, and distinguished from** heirs*' as applicable to his men or tenants.The grant to the archbishop and his successors occurredrepeatedly in the same year; — ^in Magna Charta we havealready observed — that the heirs of individuals were frequentlymentioned.In a plea in this reigns between the burgesses and priorof Barnstaple, the latter answered ** for himself and his siu>*' censors, that all the burgesses and their heirs should be*^ free from talliages :" most clearly marking the distinctionbetween the two. The term " successors " occurs againin the document, as well as heirs ; but the former was neverapplied to the burgesses, nor the latter to the prior, or hismonks.Before, however, we quit this period, we should observe Hume.a few passages in Hume's History, which have circulatedtoo widely, and been received with too much implicit confidence,not to require consideration.That ^'the boroughs were, in the time of Domesday, little Boroughs.^^ more than villages, and the inhabitants dependent on theking, or great lords, in a station little better than servile,"is assumed without any foundation, as our extracts fromDomesday will have shown. Whatever their situation mighthave been, it is obvious that they stood in nearly thesame relative position with respect to the rest of the country,as they do at the present day. If there has been anychange, the probability is, that they possessed then a greatercomparative importance than they do at present ; their burgessesbeing of free condition, which, at that time, was a Boxgewet.distinguishing mark of no slight importance.Hume truly says, J " that they were not then so much as incorporated:" he adds — "they formed no community, — ^were not regarded as a body politic, — ^and being really no ^• Cart. Ant. T. 4, 5. t Rot. Pat. 8. m. 14. Petit. MS. In. Temp.

Hume errs in supposing that the burgesseswere no community nor body politic ; — ^they were both, andas much recognized as the other great bodies in the nation — '•the great body politic of the people — the communities of thelaity — the clergy— of counties (which Hume seems to recognize)—of baronies — hundreds — wapentakes — forests— andother similar divisions.* And so far from their being incapableof being represented in Parliament — ^they were actuallyrepresented nearly 150 years before any of them were incorporated.Whatever Hume or other authors may assertto the contrary — considering the peculiar nature of the boroughsin England — their origin, object, and connection withthe administration of our particular laws, it is impossible torun a parallel, or maintain the analogy of our corporationswith those of the French ; although, no doubt, in later times,the principles of the civil law relative to those bodies havebeen adopted in both countries.Hume, however, justly observes — that the institution ofcounty courts in England has had a greater effect upon thegovernment than has been distinctly pointed out by historians,or traced by antiquaries. His only error is in mistakingthe county courts, — for the sheriff's tom, — ^and theanalogous courts of the leet in the boroughs — ^in which thecriminal law was administered, and the great objects of goodgovernment and effective police secured. Nor is he erroneousin calling this the ancient — simple — ^and j^optt/ar judicature ofour country; — the abandonment of which he properly deplores.Hume is also correct in saying that the charter granted toApp. 2, p. 122, note M.STATUTES—CHARTERS. 426London, by William the Conqueror, was little more than a Jo'"'-letter .of protection, and a declaration that the citizens shouldnot be treated as slaves, because they were to be consideredas " free men " and " law-worthy." The truth is — ^that heseems to have bean misled by Brady, in whom he placed implicitconfidence; and from whom he assumes, contrary tothe fact — ^that almost all the boroughs of England had sufferedin the shock of the Conquest, and were extremely decayedbetween the death of the Confessor and the time whenDomesday was framed. As it appears from that document,that although some few places had houses destroyed andwasted, in the greater number of instances, the houses — inhabitants— and rents — ^were much increased.HENRY III.In the long reign of Henry III. we meet with many stag ^^^^tunes — charters— and laws, which relate to the subject of ^272.our inquiry. ,-^*^1. As to the first, they occur chiefly at the commencement Statutes,of the reign, when the king was a minor, and during the 'protectorate of the Earl of Pembroke, Marshal of England.Of these the principal were, the confirmation of the GreatCharter— the charter of the Forest — the provisions of Mertonthe statutes of the Exchequer — and that of Marlborough.The first is of course the most important, and the passagesrelative to this inquiry will be selected from it, as well assome few extracts from the other statutes. v^2. The charters commenced chiefly about the 11th year of Charters.the reign, after the king's minority had ceased. They werenumerous ; but many of them were either confirmations, or 'resemble those before cited. These we shall only mentiongenerally : any which differ materially from the precedingwill be particularly noticed ; but we venture to anticipate, —that the conclusion which will result from the whole of them.^\426 ECCLESIASTICAL LAW.Hen. III. viii be the same as that already drawn from the records ofthe preceding reigns.^^- 3. The hews will consist chiefly of Bracton and Britton,^ , - from which it will be apparent that the general principlesapplicable to our institutions (though much amplified) continned the same as they were in the reign of Henry II., when*^ Glanville" made his compilation : — at least with respect tothe subject of our investigation.Gnat It was in this rein that the Grand Customer of .^many* was composed about 40 years after the accession ofRichard I.The Provincial Constitutions made archbishop Langton,1222. ^t Oxford in the sixth year of this reign, show the effortsClergy: then made to exempt the clergy from all temporal jurisdiction,and from a participation in the ordinary burdens of thestate.Excommunications was threatened to all those who, in prejudiceof ecclesiastical liberty , presumed to burden religiousmen, clerks, beneficed clergy or their men living on ecclesiasticalground — ^with talliages, taxes, murage, tributes, expensesof fortifications, or of carriages, or other undue andunaccustomed exactions. And that this threat might operatestrongly on all the people, notice of it was directed to begiven b]^ the priests in all the churches at Christmas, Easter,Whitsuntide, and saint days, in the vulgar tongue.1^^* Again it was provided, that no clergyman should be stewardor bailiff of any town, by means of which they might be boundto lay duties, or exercise secular jurisdiction, especially wherethere was judgment of blood.Again, in the Constitutions of Boniface, j; Archbishop ofCanterbury, made at the Council at Lambeth, in the 45thyear of Henry III., the strongest injunction was laid upon thearchbishops, and all the clergy, that they should not allowthemselves to be drawn under secular judgment; and theseverest ecclesiastical punishments, of excommunication andinterdict, were threatened against those, whether sheriffs orPres. ii. lost.

Indeed the whole tenour of these Constitutions wasto the same effect : — protecting them from proceedings byquo warranto — suits at lay courts-sand other liabilities.In confirmation of the preceding remarks, and arriving at 1262.the Great Charter of Liberties, renewed in this reign, we must Lib^tLeLobserve that its first chapter provides — ^* that the Church^ shall secrecy and have all her own rights and privileges*' inviolable'By the 14th chapter of the same charter it was again or ^*p- disdained— ^that no man of the church (ecclesiastical persona)should be amerced after the quantity of his spiritual benefice,but after his lay tenement.The grant was made generally " omnibus de regno iwstro/' 1224.which in the English translation, is rendered, to vil freemen of ^'««™«'»'the realm — ^and properly so ; because the first chapter, whichimmediately follows, expressly grants the liberties mentionedin it, to the freemen of the kingdom, and theirheirs. The terms, liberi homines — which are met with soearly in the Saxon laws, and used in the charters of John, wererepeated here in many clauses of this charter of confirmation— from whence it appears, that it was also, at thisperiod, the proper legal description of those who, during thereigns of John, Henry III., and Edward I., formed that importantclass in the community of the country.The 14th section of the wipip charter ^ also mentioned free Cap. 14.men, — villains — and ecclesiastical persons, — as well as merchants,— barons, — and earls ; — ^which enumeration mightprobably be assumed to include, the principal classes ofthe community existing at that time.Again in chapter 16, as to repairing bridges — ^and also in ^^P- ^^>chapter 24 — the freemen were again spoken of.The important protections afforded to the subjects of thisrealm, by the celebrated 29th chapter of this charter, were Cap. 29.expressly given to the freemen; — and there can be no doubt, '428 CONFIRMATION OF MAGNA CHARTA.^^°' ^^^* but that term included every person in the kingdom whowas capable of enjoying any liberties — ^namely, ** every personof free conditionCap. 32. In the 32nd chapter, the freemen were prohibited fromalienating their land, to such an extent as not to have suffix\' "^ ' cent for the lords of the fee to have their service.\ r , That this term had a specific application to a particularclass in society, may be collected — from its omission in someplaces, where a more general term was necessary, for thepurpose of including as well izU vUlcUns, as those who werefree. Thus in the 34th chapter of the same charter, as toa woman's appeal of death, the term ** liber*' was ooiittedyand the general term ** nullus" was adopted.Care The expression, ** liber homo," was also used in the CartaForestaeae. In the 9th chapter of which it was provided, — '' that^^^ every freeman may assist his own ward,and drive his swine, forthat purpose, through the king's forests — ^and that no occasionshall be taken of it." But in the very next chapter, wherethe subject was general — and not confined to any particularclass of society — the term 'Miser homo" was omitted, andthe general term ** nullus" adopted.Lawful Another term also common in the law, occurs in the 4thchapter of the confirmation of Magna Charta. — 3W lawfrd^^ and discreet men being directed to answer for the issues of thelands in ward.In the first charter of William the Conqueror to London,he granted, as we have seen — ^that the inhabitants of the boroughshould be lauMoarthy^ which we have before explained./ Here the term occurs of lawful men (legales homines) in preciselythe same meaning as those words in the charter ofWilliam I. — ^namely: — ^that having given their pledges toabide the law when called upon, they should be dealt with onall occasions as lawful men ; and on this account be liable todoall services necessary for the state, as they received inreturn, the protection and privileges which the law affordsthem. The term was used in chap. 14 and 18. Also in thecharter of the forest, chap. 1 and 6 — In the provisions ofMerton, chap. 6 — ^^The statute of ^^The pillory, 51 Henry III. —CONFIRMATION OF MAGNA CHARTA. 42&The Statute de Scaccario, Cotton.

Cap. 17.which speaks of the sheriff, constable, escheated, coroner,and other bailiffs of the king.It was declared, by the 18th chapter, that the sheriff or Cap. 18.ftaiZi^ should attach the goods of the king's tenant who diedindebted to him.In the 19th chapter, the &ai/i/f of the constable of a castle Cap. 19.was mentioned.By the 21st chapter, sheriffs and bailiffs — ^to restrain whose Cap. 21oppressions and exactions was a material object of the ^***'^'charter — were prohibited from taking the horses or carts tomake carriages, without paying the price limited* — thebailiffs were also prohibited from taking the demesne carts ofspiritual persons and knights ; and the wood of any man forbuilding the king's castles. Bailiffs were also mentioned inthe 28th chapter, which related to wager of law.To illustrate also the general application of this term, andits correlative " bailiwick" it should be observed — that the Bailiwick14th chapter of the Cctrta ForesttBj calls the place in which Cartathe forester was to exercise \i\^jurisdictiony " his bailiwick;" ^ ^^and the 16th chapter enumerates bailiffs amongst the officerswho were prohibited from holding pleas of the forests. (In chapter nine of this confirmation, the provision of the Cap. 9. (charter of John was repeated — ^that the city of London should London,have all the old liberties and customs, which it hath beenSax. LI., and many Charters.430 CONFIRMATION OF MAGNA CHARTA.Hen.

The 14th chapter continued the same distinction qffree-Freemen. n^en and lawful men, which we have noted before, — and alsomentions merchants and villains.It provides that a free man (liber homo,) should not beamerced for a small fault, but after the manner of the fault.A merchant likewise ; and a villain.

It however, seems hardly to justly thisconclusion — ^and amounts to nothing more, than ^' that burgesses,though essentially distinguished from villains," werethe lowest grade of freemen : which is very probable —because many of them were those who, unlike freeholders,had become free from villain's estate, merely by residencefor a year and a day in a borough — to which privilegedplaces, we may remember in Glanville, this species of emancipationwas confined ; and therefore, on this ground, it isvery probable, they were esteemed of an inferior grade —but it does not appear that any other inference can properlybe drawn from the passage.Cap. 8. ^ In the 8th chapter, writs concerning ^^ natives*' werementioned.A statute of the 51st of Henry III., concerning the assiseof bread and beer, (so frequently spoken of in the lawsfrom the reign of William I., and in charters at subsequentperiods,) mentioned cities and boroughs.Cornwall. We have observed before, in our comments upon Domesday,that Cornwall appeared in a peculiar situation, as noboroughs were alluded to in the return for that shire. Itwas also specially mentioned in the statute ^^ de scaccario,'' andexcepted from the other counties with respect to wards andescheats : — ^and the sheriff of Devonshire was expressly directedto keep the king's wards and escheats in Cornwall. Inthat statute, many regulations were made respecting thesheriiT's farmers, and bailiffs of franchises, as the king'sSTATUTE OF MARLBERGE. 435officers. The latter being directed to be answerable to the ^g°- ^^^-sheriffs — whose tours, and inquiries there, were noted.In the statute of the pillory and tumbrel, allusion was made p^^["^ °^to the liberty of markets: — but there was no reference to J'***.'^"'"-boroughs.In the 2nd chapter of the statute of Marlborough, it is ??*^^*^®provided, — ^that none shall distrain any to come to his court i267.who is not of his fee, or over whom he has no jurisdiction ;nor shall make distresses without his fee, or the place wherehe has a bailiwick or jurisdiction : — clearly establishing thelimited and local nature of jurisdictions.In the 7th chapter, the/w/Z county court was mentioned, as Cap. 7.the place where writs were to be openly read.We shall have occasion hereafter to quote instances,particularly in the Cinque Ports and Huntingdon, wherethis term was applied to the court leet of the borough, as it ishere to the county court.The 9th chapter related to the doing suits to the courts of Cap. 9.great lords. It was provided, that none who was enfeoffed bydeed from thenceforth should be distrained to do such suitto the court of his lord, unless he was specially bound theretoby the form of his deed.The 10th chapter, which related to the sheriff's tours, Cap.

And the turns should be kept afterthe form of the Great Charter, and as they were used in thetimes of King Richard and King John."Here the doctrines for which we have before contended. Ecclesiastics.that ecclesiastical persons were exempted from the sheriff'stom and court leet, is expressly recognized; and the placeat which the suit was to be done is limited to that in whichthe individuals dwell.fftit436 STATUTE OF MARLBERGE.Hen. III . In many of the previous charters, we have seen instancesof exemptions from assises and juries, and many more willoccur in those of subsequent periods.Cap. 14. Thg j4tj^ chapter of this statute applied to this subject,and was as follows : — " concerning charters of exemption and'^ liberties, that the purchaser shall not be impanelled in assises,^^ juries and inquests, it is provided — that if their oaths be so*^ requisite, that without them justice cannot be ministered, as^' in great assises, perambulations, and in deeds or writings of'* covenant when they be named for witnesses, or in attaints,'* or in other like cases, they shall be compelled to swear;'' saving to them at another time their foresaid liberty andexemption."Cap. 20. And the 20th chapter provided, touching assigns, ** thatin counties, hundreds, or in court barons, or in other courts,none shall need to swear to warrant his assign."Cap.?4.^^ The 24th chapter provided, — "that the justices in eyref shall not amerce townships, because all being 12 years oldcame not afore the sheriffs and coroners to make inquiriesof things pertaining to the crown, so that there come sufficientout of those towns by whom such inquests may befully made."Turn. fj^jg clause probably accounts for the sheriff's turn havingy'^ fallen into desuetude, as the attendance was confined only tothose whose presence was required. But it does not appearto apply to cities, boroughs, or to the court leets, andtherefore a full attendance of all persons of the requisite agewas still necessary: — which would account for the callingover all the householders, as required at the court leet, andwhich is still done at many places — as in the instances ofthe ward-motes in the city of London ; — the burgh-motes inMaidstone — Huntingdon — Looe — and other boroughs.IRELAND.Ireland. To pursue the statutes of this reign, we should note the'^ Statute HibemisB," with respect to inheritances in thatkingdom, and the course which the justices itinerant were toobserve respecting the coparcenary of listers, for the purpose.Ireland-NORWICH.— NEWCASTLE-UPON-TYNE. 437^f showing that it was intended at that time that the laws of Hen. in.both countries should be similar. Petitions were receivedfrom Ireland requiring to be informed how the law was in England.The English laws were accordingly certified; with directionsthat the law in Ireland in that respect should be thesame as in England.By the Great Charter for Ireland, it was amongst other 1216.things provided, that the City of Dublin should have all itsancient liberties and free customs, and that all other citiestowns, boroughs, and ports, should have all their liberties andfree customs.The king made many grants to the city o{ Norwich: and Norwich.in the 7th year of his reign, he appointed four persons to be [ .sbailiffs instead of the provost,* \ S ^And subsequently, the charters of Richard and John, as to 1228. i ' *the trial of novel disseisin, were confirmed .+In another period also freedom from arrests. 1255.In 1256, the king granted to the citizens the return of 1256.writs, the exclusion of all sheriffs and bailiffs ; and provided,that all merchants trading there, should be in scot andlot : — and that no guild or fraternity should be held withinthe city, to its damage : — an irresistible proof, that guilds .^-^were separate from the citizens.At this period the king seized Norwich, in consequence of 1257.disturbances in the city ; and it seems, he retained it in hishands for some years. An interdict of the Pope was alsofulminated against the citizens; but, upon the additionalpayment of 400/. beyond their former fee-farm rent, thecity, with its liberties, was restored.In this year, there was a talliage of 120 marks raised upon 1223.the town of Newcastle-upon-Tyne : J and from the documents ^upon-already cited, relative to that borough, it would seem impossiblenot to infer, that such talliage was paid by the burgessesgenerally — that is, all the free inhabitants of theburgh,Rot.

There was also a grant to the honest men of Newcastle andtheir heirs, of the town at fee-farm ; in which the charter andgrant of Henry II. were referred to ; — as well as the loss ofrents by reason of the ditch, and new works made under thecastle. And the burgesses were in no wise to be answerableto the sheriff or constable; — that term, no doubt, applyingto the constable of the castle.*1261. The Bishop of Durham was prohibited from citing the burgessesof Newcastle out of their own borough :f — a directionwhich would be unreasonable, and almost insensible, if itwere not confined to persons inhabiting within it; — itwould be likewise as unreasonable, if it did not apply to allthe inhabitants, with the legal exceptions we have beforeexplained.1224. The inhabitants of Hindoo received a confirmation of theirHindoo. • /. nexemption from tolls.1225. The men of Andover had also a confirmation of their town,Andover. ^ /» j.atjee-farm.JIt must, however, be remarked here, as we have alreadyseen in the former charters of Andover, that there was nomention of the borough or burgesses.1227. Henry III. granted seven separate charters to Londonsome of which are probably to be accounted for, from theking having seized the liberties of the city into his ownhands.Rot. Cart. 19 Hen.

III. all the personal property of the city ; which is another strongground for assuming, — that its privileges were purchased,and intended to be enjoyed, by all the inhabitants or citizens.For if a fifteenth was payable from the personal propertyof all the inhabitants within the city, of which there isno doubt, then it is clear, that the inhabitants paid for theircharters ; and as these are only confirmations, the inference is,that all the chapters were, from the commencement, paid for inthe same manner.123T. There was a grant of this date, which recites a covenant, byRichard, Earl of Cornwall, the brother of the king, upon theone part — and the mayor and commonalty of the city ofLondon, upon the other. It is said to have been made inthe 13th year, — whereby Richard granted, that all mayorsand the commonalty might hold Queenhithe, at the fern of50/. ; and the earl affixed his seal, — and the mayor and commonalty,their common seal. King Henry III. confirmedthis covenant, by a charter of this date, in which also theCommon first mention occurs of the commonalty^pf London : — ^a term,upon which such frequent comments have been made, andfrom which such important inferences have been drawn,that it is impossible to pass it over in silence — particularlyas it is applied to a body of so much consequence, both inancient and modem times, as the citizens of London.It is a word of the most general import ; and has beenused in the earliest periods of our history, as applicable tovarious classes of men.Thus, an assise of the reign of Henry II., concerning thebearing of arms, speaks of all the burgesses, and the wholecommonalty of freemen.*Also the writs which were issued in the 49th of HenryIII., for the expenses of the knights of the shire.The statute of Westminster, 3rd of Edward I., was madeby the assent of all the " commonalty of the realm ;" and itdeclared, " that the commonalty of the realm are bound toaid the king''The parliamentary writs which were issued in the 22nd♦ Wilk. a33.Commonalty. 44I)len. III.of Edward I., required that the knights should have powerto consent for themselves and the whole community of thecounty : — and those for the election in boroughs directed, thatthe burgesses should have similar powers, for the communitiesof the citizens and burgesses ; and the returns weremade in the same form.The Articuli super Cartes, 28th of Edward I., weregranted to the whole commonalty of the realm — (toute la !commune). \In Ryley's Placenta Parliamentary,* 33rd of Edward I.,there are two petitions by the community of the county of 'Cumberland.In the same books there is a petition from Scotland,stating — that their representatives were elected by the wholecommunity of the kingdom.There is also a petition from the community of Northumberlandand petitions from the community of EnglandIn the 34th of Edward I., an aid was granted to the king \for the whole community of the kingdom, to make his son aknight.The statutes of the 15th of Edward III., were made by theassent of the commonalty of the realm. That of the 28thof Edward III., directed the coroners to be chosen by thecommons of the county.The pardon granted by Edward III., in the 36th year ofhis reign, speaks both of the commoners of England and thecommoners of towns.In the 8th of Henry VI., a statute gave to the inhabitantsof Tewkesbury, an action against the commonalty of theForest of Dean.In many statutes, from the reign of Edward VI. to*the3£dw.vl.close of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, terms were used Ph. andwhich are decisive upon this point — for the expressions free is, 29,quietly occur, of commonalties^ corporate or not corporate. "*We find some authors also confirming this view of thesubject. Thus throughout the annals of William of Worcester," communities " are constantly used for the communes242 ad 250. f Page 243. j Page 242. f Pages 246 and 225.iiit442 L0ND0N.-COMMONALTY.Hen.

But to negativethat inference, a few other instances will suffice : — thusthe commonalty of the county of Cornwall make a complaintagainst the tinners.f In the second Institutes; aprecise is directed to the commonalty of the Forest of Deanand the hundreds of B. and W., which was held good forone entire commonaltyIn Jenkins's Centuries]] the bailiffs and commonalty of Daleare mentioned, which place never was a borough. And toshow its use, in a parliamentary sense, we should observe,Yarmouth, that the early returns for Yarmouth were by the communitas.^ In 1660, the question being — ^whether the right of electionwas in a select number of burgesses— or the burgesses atlarge, — it was decided by the committee, and reed to bythe House — that the latter had the right.Heading. In the Reading case, in 1716, when the inhabitants weredecided to have the right of election, returns made '* pro com-meditate et per communities " were cited, to prove the rightof the inhabitants which was adopted by the committee;and negatived that of the freemen of the corporation, whoseclaim was rejected.Peered In PetcTsfieldy where the right eras held to be in thefreeholders, there were many returns by the commonalty.East In Last Grinstead also, when the rifi^ht was in the inha-Grinstead. ®2 Hearne*6 Lib.

III.in the burgage holders only. jAfter these various precedents, we conceive it impossiblethat the exploded error — of this term having a corporate application— can any longer he maintained.There is another feature also of this charter which requiresobservation. It is said to be made ^' under the common seal common** by the mayor and commonalty' — the possession of which, ' ^as before observed, has undoubtedly been assumed in modemtimes to be one of the peculiar characteristics of corpora .tions ; but it is clear that anciently seals only were adoptedand not signatures — as well by individuals as by all aggregatebodies. The sheriff— coroner — and all other public functionaries.— A town or borough would have one for the generalbody* Nor is this matter of theory alone, as many placesare mentioned by Browne Willis,* and other authors, whichhave never been incorporated, but which still had common >seals ; for instance, Bossiney, St. Germains — Honiton — Ash-burton— Westminster — Minehead — Peter^ld — Newton —Lymington — Fordham — Midhurst — Lewes — New Shoreham .Shaftesbury — Grecs Bedwin.An illustration of the doctrine as to seals may be seen inSir William Jones' Reports in which a record of an iter atWindsor is quoted of a Swain Mote roll, sealed with one [seal ; and the attorney-general said, '' if one of the officersof the forest put but one seal by the assent of the whole,it is as good as if every one put his separate seal ;" as in }case divers men enter into an obligations and they all consent ^ftt^set one seal to it, it is a good obligation of them aU,an this year the king granted his Great Charter to the 1253.mayor and citizens of London, confirming to them the libertiesand free customs which they had in the time of KingHenry, his grandfather, and by preceding charters, withother confirmations as to the mayor, fee-farm, and acquittanceof toll.That the Saxon laws were still in use, and practised in the 1248.city of London, we may infer from an entry upon the Great Laws.3 Not.

In this year, when the writs were issued for the electionof certain knights, citizens and burgesses, who were to attenda great council at London — none were directed to the citizensof London — ^because, from their having sided with the barons,their liberties had been seized into the hands of the crownsJ Prescript Those liberties the city could not obtain again but by a\\'^\ re-grant, which would be within the time of legal memory;y- ' and therefore even if London had been a corporation by presscription, which we have proved it not to have been, ii couldnot after this seizure have prescribed to he so.^ As a confirmation of that opinion, we find the kingSmith the 60th year of his reign, by a charter granted at northamptonto the citizens of London, in consideration of 20,000marks paid as an atonement for their crimes and misdemeanorscommitted against the queen and the king's brother,then King of the Romans, and the king's son Edward,remitted to them, and their heirs, all crimes and trespasses:and that they should enjoy all their rights andliberties as they formerly did. And all the citizens in theprison were to be discharged, except those given as pledgesto the king's son Edward.It will be observed, that this charter was also granted to thecitizens and their A^zr^— clearly shewing that there was noincorporation at that time, notwithstanding it was subsequentto their use of a common seal.The next day, the 11th of January, the king granted anothercharter to the city, whereby the citizens were empoweredto traffick with their merchandise, wheresoever theypleased, and that they might abide for their trading wheresoeverthey would.This charter, it will be remembered, is like those granted tomany other places, and is in conformity with some of the early• Rot. M. 1 Dor. Mag. Rtp. t 3 Hot. 7 B.t Prone, 30. ^ Equal to 13,333/. 6«. Sd,LONDON. 446laws to which we have referred ; and the abiding of the Hen. III.citizens in the places to which they went for the purpose ofselling their merchandise, is consistent with what we havebefore observed, and of which we shall hereafter show manyinstances, of persons mentioned as residing in cities %g^C^"boroughs as foreigners ; but for the reasons we have so oftenrepeated — ^if they continued to reside for a year and a day inany other city and borough, they would cease to be citizensof London, and would become citizens of the place in whichthey so dwelt.In this year, the king granted a long charter to the citizens 1268.of London, and their heirs, which stated, he had again re- charte?.civet them into his grace and favour, after divers trespassesand forfeitures of them, and their commonalty ; for whichthey had submitted themselves to the king. The charter re-granted the privileges they had before enjoyed, of not pleadingwithout the walls; — the plaints being determined byfour or five of the citizens, — ^with acquittal of murder in thecity, portsoken, and battle : — confirming the ancient customsof the city. Free and lawful men were spoken of inthe course of this charter. There was also the exemption fromforced lodgings — and that they might dwell, wheresoever theycame with their merchandises. Freedom from toll — and thehustings. Foreigners and miskennihg were mentioned, andforestalling. — Also merchant strangers. There was a specialprovision, that as to their debts " no person shall be enrolledupon the recognizance of any person, who is not then known,or unless it be manifested concerning his person, by the'^ testimony of six or four hateful men who be sufficient toanswer." All these privileges were enumerated with muchmore particularity and illustration, than they were in thefonder charters.In this same year, a writ was directed to the mayor, sheriffs,and whole commonalty of the city, requiring them to swearallegiance in their hustings, or at Paul's Cross.*And here it is clear, that this writ must have been intended,to have included, the whole body of the inhabitantslib. de Antic .

III. eth the exceptions to which we have before alluded, ofligiouB persons, aliens, foreigners, &c. ; for unless the writwas so extensive in its operation, it would in fact, have failedin the object it had in view.OXFORD.— University AND CITY.As the early history of the University of Oxford, must necessarilybe much interwoven with that of the borough andcity, it has been thought advisable to take their histories together,and to trace the origin of each from the earliest times, —at least, as far as relates to the subject four present inquiry.Minute researches, however, into the original institution ofthe University which is involved in much obscurity, wouldbe here misplaced, for, as it was not originally a borough,and did not, like the borough, anciently return members toParliament, we could extract little connected with the historyof burgesses or their rights, except as far as the peculiar circumstancesof the University, contrasted with those of theborough, may illustrate its primitive constitution, and throwsome light on the nature of other boroughs.The first trace of the town is to be found, as we haveDomesday. gg^,^ before, in Domesday, where the burgesses and their servicesdue to the king, were frequently mentioned. It thereforewas, undoubtedly, a borough by prescription.Henry II. Henry II. granted by charter, certain lands within the cityof Oxford, to Henry of Oxford. And it seems that he alsogranted considerable privileges to the borough, for in theJohn, first year of the reign of King John, there was an entry ont heoblata rolls, that the burgesses of Oxford, gave 200 marks forthe confirmation of the liberties which they had in the time ofHenry II., which were stated to be the same as those ofLondon ; and also for having their town at fee-farm.The nature of the liberties of the city of London, as wellthose granted by William I., as those of Henry I. and HenryII., we have before seen ; — and therefore it is clear, thatOxford had, before the time of legal memory, possession ofthe same extensive privileges which were at that time grantedto the city of London. No doubt they continued to beyOXFORD.— UNIVERSITY AND CITY. 447enjoyed at this period ; for in the fourth year of Edward I. it H^^ni-appears, from an entry in the memoranda of the Exchequer,* 1275.that in the reign of Henry III., there was not only a mayor, 1292.but also bailiffs. And in the 20th of Edward I. the mayorof Oxford, described as one of the comburgenses of the town,was presented to the king.Indeed Henry III., in the 13th year of his reign, expressly 1228.confirmed to the burgesses and their heirs all their formerliberties, customs, laws, and immunities That they shouldhave a guild-merchant, with all things belonging to it ; —that no person who was not of the guild-merchant, shouldtrade in the city or suburbs ; — that the burgesses shouldbe free of toll, passage, &c., with all the liberties which theyhad been used to have with the citizens of London* Thatthey should have their town at fee-farm ; and trade in commonin London with the citizens. That they should consultthe citizens of London as to any matter that mightarise, and abide by what they should adjudge. That theyshould not plead without the borough ; but might dischargethemselves, as the citizens of London, because they wereall under the same law, custom, and liberty ; — also to havetoll and them, as they had.In the 41st Henry III., the burgesses had a grant of thereturn of writs. JIn the 28th year of this reign, we find the grant to the 1244.UniversityUniversity of Oxford which first interfered with the muni ofcipal government of the town: — after which it graduallyacquired powers materially affecting the original commonlaw jurisdiction of the borough. As the University wassubsequently incorporated — and acquired the power ofreturning members to Parliament — it becomes material toconsider the charters minutely, and trace their progressfrom the commencement to the final establishment of thejurisdiction, and the parliamentary rights now enjoyed.ThosBj haweneTy of the University, having been printed atMaynaid^s Rep. p. 4. 1 2 Hearne.

That, as long asit should please the king, in the causes of the clerks, (clerici)arising out of the taxing, or letting of houses andcontracts for horses or victuals, or for other moveable things.Prohibition either in the town or suburb of Oxford, the king's prohibitumshould not run — but the causes should be decided before thechancellor of the University of Oxford, notwithstanding anywrit of prohibition.\ J ^ , J . ' The term University here used, was probably borrowed^> from the civil laws, which had been discovered at Amelialittle more than a hundred years before; and it is observable,that the body here spoken of, does not resemblethat of burgesses, whose very essence was local, but it was asociety existing independently of the place, in which itsmembers resided; as at the time this charter was madethe borough was in full possession of the liberties beforementioned both in this reign and the previous charters ofKing John, and had the same exclusive jurisdiction fireplaceas the citizens of London.The power given to the chancellor was <Hily a peculiarrei ' \i V authority over the students, who were described as clerici, and^^ probably at that time were ecclesiastics, or at least their attendants; — as no doubt the university was then purely anecclesiastical establishment.If therefore, there was at that period any society whichmight be treated altogether as a corporation — and as havingno existence but in its corporate character — it was this body♦ Registrar Privilegicruro Alma Universities Ozoniensis, to. Oxon., 1770;etvide etiatn Rot. Carter. Lend.Oxford-UNIVERSITY AND CITY. 449of the university ; — and yet it was not incorporated till the H^"- ^^^-Reign of Elizabeth — and then continued for some time without ' <y,vreturning members to Parliament, which privilege was notgranted to the university till the reign of James I. Anotherstriking instance that corporations did not exist at this period^and that the privilege of returning members, was not inright of their being corporations ; — the university having beenincorporated some time before it returned members to Parliament;— and a subsequent special grant being necessary togive it that power ; — placing it, nevertheless, like Cambridge,in the anomalous position of returning members accordingto the exigency of a writ — which requires citizens and burgessesto be returned from each city and borough; — theuniversity, in fact, being neither the one nor the other.The king also granted another charter in this year to the 1248. .university, which was given at Woodstock in the presence of u/ ^the proctors for the scholars and of the burgesses of thetown, by which it was directed*— that if any injury should bedone to the scholars, inquisition thereof should be had, aswell by the neighbouring villages, as by the burgesses. Ifthe burgesses should kill, assault, or injure any of thescholars the commonalty of the town should be punished, andamerced by themselves ;— and if the bailiffs should be negligentor guilty of deceit in doing their duty against everyoffender, they should be punished and amerced by themselves,and not with the commonalty.Applause follows, for limiting the rate of interest to be paidby the scholars to the Jews.It is also provided, that whenever the mayor and bailifftake the oath of fidelity in their common place, the communityof the town should give notice to the chancellor,that he might be present, if he wished it, either by himself,or by some other persons. And the oath, as far as relatesioi\ii^ scholars, was directed to be, " that they should keep theliberties and customs of the university' Two aldermenwere to be appointed, as ordained by William of York,to execute justice in the absence of the prefects, (preposition ; )and it was provided, (in conformity with the commonVOL. I. GO450 OXFORD UNIVERSITY AND CITY.Hen. Ill, law,) — that every burgess of Oxford should answer Jar Msfamily; — so that if any one of them should hill or impureany clerk, or any of his own, the same burgess should producethe malefactor that justice might be done upon Mm, accordingto the custom of the realm.It was also directed, that a day's notice of the trial Cff breedand beer should be given to the chancellor and proctors ofthe university, that they might attend if they pleased.We have here the early traces of the disputes and jealous' sees which existed between the students and ike burgesses.It seems that the burgesses had not, in the inquisitionswhich had been held as to offences against the scholarsdealt fairly with them ; — and that the latter had, therefore,obtained from the king this charter, requiring that suchinquisition should be made by the surrounding villages, aswell as by the burgesses. Whether they were to be distinctinquisitions, or were to be formed partly burgesses, andpartly of the villagers, does not directly appear; but thispassage at all events is sufficient to show one fact connectedwith the burgesses, — namely, that their peculiarcharacter as a privileged class was entirely local, and thatReticence. ^^y jj^ ^^^ reside in the neighbouring villages, otherwise^ " " this regulation would have been useless to the scholars.The object of the next provision, that the commonalty ofthe town, and the bailiffs, should be amerced separately bythemselves, is not very apparent; — but it may be conjectured,that if the bailiffs were to be amerced with the commonalty,they would be disinclined to enforce a payment U>which they were themselves to contribute; and therefore,they were exempted from the common amercements, andwere to be liable only for their neglect in not levying iton others.The presence of the chancellor at the taking of the oath bythe mayor and bailiffs, as well as at the trial of the breadand beer, was the first step towards the union of the ecclesiasticaland civil power at Oxford, which seems to have beenfurther attempted in the next charter.Aldermen, The aldermen, who are here first mentioned, refer to theOXFORD.— UNIVERSITY AND CITY. ^ 461civil Jurisdiction ; and the judicial duty assigned to them is ^®^^^t;liat which the ancient Saxon aldermen executed in the f oh"mote, and which has since been converted into the moderncorporate officer of that name.The next provision, as to the responsibility. of every burgess Burgesses.ybr his family (which, by a subsequent charter, is extended -^to civil as well as criminal matters), is only declaratory ofthe common law, as found in the early Saxon laws, and inJSrizcton, Britton, Fleta and the Mirror : clearly indicating,as observed before, that the burgesses were the housekeepersand that they, and not their inmates were responsible to thelaw ; — ^because the jealousy with which the house of everyindividual was protected, prevented even the officers of justice,or of civil government, from entering it ; and as a substitutefor such an intrusion, the law cast the responsibilityfor all the inmates on the ostensible master of the family —the permanent inhabitant — the burgess.The term commonalty is used in this charter, as it is in ^^"7:the subsequent parliamentary returns, for the borough; —but it will be seen in a variety of other instances, that itdid not at that period import a corporation, but was appliedindifferently to the commonalty of the realm, county, &c. or tothe commonalty of a city or borough — of which this use of theword affords an illustration : — ^as we have previously shown,that the borough of Oxford, was not incorporated till a muchlaterperiod.The same king, in the 39th year of his reign, granted also 1255.another charter at Woodstock, to the university of the scholarsof Oxford: — which, for the peace and tranquillity, as well asbenefit of the university, provided, that there should he four(Mermen in Oxford, with whom eight of the more discreet andlawful burgesses of the town should be associated : all ofwhom should swear fidelity to the king, and should beassisting and advising to the mayor and king's bailiffs — forpreserving the king's peace — ^for keeping the assise of thesaid town —-and for searching out malefactors, breakers of thepeace, vagabonds at night, and receivers of robbers andoo2J452 OXFORD.-UN1VERS1TY AND CITY.Hen. III. malefactors : and the persons so appointed were to take aooath faithfully to perform all those things.It was further provided, that in each parish of the tovmof Oxford, there should be two men elected from the moreIsLVfful parishioners and sworn, — that every fortnight theyshould inquire diligently that no suspected person wasreceived as a guest in the parish — and if any person hadreceived another for three nights in his house he should beanswerable for him.*There was also a clause against re-grating: — ^and anotherdirecting, that if a layman should inflict any great or enormousinjury on a clerk, he should be immediately taken andimprisoned in the castle of Oxford, and there detained untilhe should satisfy the clerk, and that at the will of the chancellorand university. And if the clerk should have beenobstinate, and the injury small, then the offender was to besent to the prison of the town. A corresponding clauserelates to injuries inflicted on laymen by the clerks, who (orgreater offences were to be imprisoned in the castle till thechancellor should demand them; and for smaller, in theprison of the town, until the chancellor should free them.Regulations as to the bakers and brewers — the sale of wine^and the assise of bread and beer — were also added. Andit was directed, that as often as the trial of bread and beershould be made, the chancellor of the university, or somebodydeputed on his behalf, should be present, if upon beingsummoned they should wish to be so; — ^and if they were notpresent, and had not been summoned, the trial was to be ofno effect.This charter appears to afford one of the earliest tracesof persons appointed to assist the mayor in the municipali t L I*' ' government of the place.It has also a striking peculiarity — probably arising from itsrelating to an ecclesiastical body — that it adopts the ecclesiasticaldivision into parishes ; and not that of the common»law into hundreds — boroughs — wards or decent. Whilst• Ll. Sax.Oxford-UNIVERSITY AND CITY. 453the provision as to suspected guests and the responsibility Hen. III.of the housekeeper for those who remained beyond the thirdnight — are borrowed altogether from the common law. So thatit appears to have been the intention of the king, by thischarter — to unite the ecclesiastical jurisdiction and the civilgovernment as the best means of governing a communityJhrmed of ecclesiastics and laity. The subsequent provisionsas to the imprisonment of ecclesiastical and lay culprits is astrong confirmation of this supposition : — as well as the regulationof the assise of bread and beer, which was one of theJunctions of the leet ; but with which the chancellor is bythis charter directed to interfere.It is observable throughout this and the subsequentcharters how gradually the power and jurisdiction of thechancellor was increased by the acquisition from time to time,of the functions of the mayor and burgesses. And it is matterof curiosity, if not of utility, to remark, that in a commonalty,circumstanced like this of Oxford — where the ecclesiasticsvied in power, if not also in numbers, with the laity — ^the custom of our early ancestors of mingling civil and eccles ^ . ^ ^statical jurisdictions together — as in the joint presidency of ^ * \the earl and bishop under the Saxon laws — was again \\l*tn^^adopted with respect to Oxford ; as best suited to meet astate of things much resembling the condition of the peoplein the Saxon period of our history.This charter was in some degree explained by one of asubsequent date in this reign, given by the same king at l^^*Woodstock, by which he granted to the university, for thetranquillity and benefit of the masters and scholars, as wellas of the burgesses and others having houses in the sametown — that for the future all the houses of the town of Oxford,inhabited and to be inhabited by the scholars, should berelaxed every five years, according to the will of taxors,sworn on either part, clerical and lay.The word " taxation'' used in the former charter ; andrelator'* and " taxator,'* in this — appear as applying to therent to be paid for the houses by the students, — and not toany tax imposed by the king, or his government.464 OXFORD.— UNIVERSITY AND CITY.Hen.

The description of burgesses, and " others, having homMts^may be urged — as the expressions occurring in other chiixteRof ^^ burgesses inhabiting" have been — ^to import that therewere persons having houses who were not burgesses — and sofar,to negative the supposition, that all iheinhe^itant copyholderswere burgesses : — the answer to which is, as givenbefore — ^that such persons might be either toomeuy trr eodemor minors, — none of whom could be burgesses.1257. Other charters were also granted in this year to the university,generally confirming their privileges* — and somedoubts having soon arisen upon the construction of the1263. former charters of the 39th of Henry III., another wasgiven, to explain them — stating, that the oath of the aldermenand assistants to the mayor, described as being required bythe former, to be taken in the king's presence, (whichhowever was not the fact, as nothing of that kind is mentionedin it,) might, in case the king was not present, betakenbefore some other person appointed for that purpose.1264. It appears, that the king being about to hold a council ofthe barons at Oxford, and to remain some time, it wasthought that the scholars could not continue there in safetytherefore the king issued a writ, (which is printed inHearne's Liber Niger from a book stated to belong to Mr.Castle,) directed to the chancellor and university, reciting• ' the above facts, — ^and directing, that the scholars should. <■ depart from Oxford, till the disturbances then existing wererepressed — when they might return and remain in safety,and enjoy all their former privileges — and the contentionsbetween the scholars and burgesses were attempted to betranquillized, by charters which the king granted to thechancellor and university, on the one hand, and to the mayorand good men of the town, on the other.In the same book, there is also another writ in the sameyear, reciting the former, and alleging the same facts, — ^andthat peace had been restored and proclaimed between theking and his barons, — ^and directing, that the chancellor assuniversity should return to Oxford, and remain there, andMS. In. Temp. Lib. f See vol. i. p. 465.Oxford-UNIVERSITY AND CITY. 456enjoy all their former liberties and privileges. That the Hen. in.mayor Bud good men of Oxford should receive the chancellorand the university f and entreat them well allowing them toenjoy their privileges.It should be observed that, in these writs, the term universityis not applied to the place, but to the body of thescholars and clerks.In the next year, another charter, containing important 1265.exemptions, was conceded to the clerks studying in theuniversity. It stated, that ^* as it might be burdensome and^^ irksome to the clerks who were attending the schools, and'' having lay fees, to be placed in assises, juries, and re-*' cognizance — the king, at the instance of the university,wishing to show especial favour to them, granted — thatas long as they should there adhere to their studies, and** should make laudable proficiency in their learning, they*^ should not be put in any assises, juries, or recognizance*'The effect of which charter, was to exempt the students fromthe interference of the sheriff or mayor, notwithstanding theyhad lay fees: and was a great step towards exempting themfrom temporal jurisdiction. The distinction between ecclesiasticaland lay fees, as to liabilities and immunities, washere expressly recognized.In the same year, a singular document occurs — recitingthat, in consequence of the great contention in the townof Cambridge three years before, some of the students » -'there had left the place, and removed themselves to the townof Northampton, wishing to establish a university there, towhich the king had then assented; but now being betterinformed of the matter, and learning that the municipal ofOxford, anciently founded and confirmed by his progenitors,and found convenient for the accommodation of the students,would be much injured, he commanded, by the advice of hiscouncil — that there should be no university in the town ofNorthampton — and that no scholars should be allowed toremain there — otherwise than as was accustomed before thecreation of the university.And finally, a charter of this date, confirmed to the scho- I268.lars the liberties granted by the charter of the 32nd of Henry466 CAMBRIDGE.-UNIVERSITY AND BOROUGH.^°' * in., and which was enrolled by the king's orders in thefollowing year.UNIVERSITY AND BOROUGH OF CAMBRIDGE.Cambridge, like Oxford, was a borough long before itsUniversity had acquired any temporal privileges * The burgesseswere mentioned at the time of the great survey ofWilliam the Conqueror: and the borough had privilegesgranted to it in this reign, and those of Henry II., andKing John.It does not appear that this university possessed temporalfranchises so soon as Oxford: nor until the 50thyear of Henry III., when that king, regarding the peace,tranquillity and benefit of the university of scholars, granted(as before provided for Oxford), that there should betwo aldermen of Cambridge, and four of the more discreetand lawful burgesses of that town, who should associatethemselves with the aldermen, and who should all swearfidelity to the king, and be assisting to the mayor andbailiffs to preserve the king's peace; — to keep assisesthere ; — and to inquire as to all malefactors — disturbers ofthe peace — night vagabonds — and receivers of robbers.That they should take an oath that they would observeall these things faithfully. That there should be twomen chosen in each ward of the town, who should makediligent inquiry lest any suspected person should be receivedas a guest in the town. And if any person shouldhave received such a one for three nights, he should answerfor him.fAfter which, other provisions follow similar in effect tothose of Oxford. JIn the same year it was also granted to the chancellor,scholars, and their successors — that all the houses which thescholars should inhabit, should be taxed according to reasonabletaxation, by two masters and two bailiffs of the town : —being in substance nearly the same as the charter to theuniversity of Oxford• 1 Pet.

MS. 106.CAMBR1DGE.-UNIVERS1TY AND BOROUGH. 467There is another document also in the same year, re- Hen, ill.citing, that because the bailiffs and burgesses of Cambridgehad not only been negligent, but also inefficient in repressingthe insolence of malefactors as they ought to have done,whereby the king had been informed, that the masters andscholars had been hindered so that they could not exercisetheir scholastic acts in the quietude so necessary for study : —the king, desiring to insure the tranquillity and peace ofthe said masters and scholars, directs — ^that the sheriiT for thetime being, whenever the bailiffs or burgesses were negligentand inefficient to repress the malefactors and disturbers ofthe peace of the king and university, should, with a sufficientposse of the county, repress these evils whenever they,should be required by the university.A strong measure no doubt on the part 'of the crown insupport of the university — but in strict conformity with theprinciples of the common law — which required the sheriffto take care that the law was filly administered and enforcedwheresoever the local authorities should fail in theborough, or privileged place.In the 54th year of the same reign, the king, by a writ,recites — ^that because the barons and others exercising tournamentsat Cambridge, and frequently flying to arms, manydangers and inconveniences were accustomed to arise, which,if tolerated, might, in process of time, manifestly lead to thedestruction of those studying there, — he, willing to provide,as far as he could, for the indemnity of the masters andscholars — ^in this respect granted to them, that no tournamentsshould be made in their town, or within five miles round,under severe penalties.The king also, by another writ, reciting, that contentionshad often arisen between the masters and scholars andthe burgesses of Cambridge,* by reason of which manydangers had threatened, as well the clergy as the people,provided a method for avoiding those dangers, and for preservingthe peace, by directing — that in every year, within15 days of the time in which the masters should have re-• Rot. Pat. ID. 8.458 CAMBRIDGE.-UNIVERSITY AND BOROUGH.Hen. Ill, sued the reading of their lectures, five scholars shouldbe chosen out of each county in England, from the mostdiscreet who should be commorant there — three from Scotland— two from Wales — three from Ireland — and ten burgesses— three from the suburbs and seven from the city, whoshould be all sworn, &c. If any bad or rebellious scholars,or laity, should be found, who, being first admonished, wouldnot correct themselves, the burgesses should swear that theywould take them according to this statute and ordinance.Provision is also made for taking the lists of all those whokeep houses who were to swear that they would not knowinglyreceive any bad person as their giuesU And all whosoreceived them were to be responsible for them. Thosewho should rebel against this ordinance, as well laity asclerks, were to be driven out of the community. And if theburgesses and clerks could not put down the disturbance,then it should be reported to the king and his council.This document then proceeds with matters immaterial forthe further elucidation of our present inquiry:— but theabove extracts are sufficient to show the nature of the provisionswhich were here adopted, in analogy to those ofOxford for the purpose of uniting the ecclesiastical withthe say jurisdiction : — and yet in such a manner as to preservethe principles of the common law, which required that everyhouseholder should be bound to the due preservation of thepeace, and should be responsible for all persons received intohis house.Thus we have seen in this reign the commencement, inOxford and Cambridge — of a united lay and ecclesiasticaljurisdiction : — and the foundation of that singular authority,which has been obtained in those places, by the two universities.1226. In the 11th of Henry III., a fine was paid by the burgessesBristol, of Bristol, for a grant, that a part of the town, called radcliffe,should answer with the county of Somerset.*The burgesses also paid a fine, for having their town at fee-petit'sMS. In. Temp. Lib. vol. i. Rot. Cart. II Henry 111. m. 7.BRIST0L.-INHAB1TANTS. 469farm. And they had a grant m this year confirming that Hen. III.of Henry 11.The above grant as to Radcliffe, establishes, that it was nopart of the city or borough of Bristol, although it was includedin the ambit of the town ; and therefore being no part of theborough, it was an adjunct of the county y and it was liableto the jurisdiction of the sheriff. And the burgesses procuredby the payment of this fine, a recognition of the liabilityto the county, and exclusion from the borough.This, in all probability, arose from some offences committedby the men of Radcliffe, for which the burgesses ofBristol were fearful of being rendered responsible; for wefind twenty years afterwards, the burgesses were desirous ofhaving this part of their suburb, united with their borough ;and therefore in the 31st year of Henry III., they procuredfrom that king, the following charter :That the burgesses of Receive, in the suburb of Bristol, 1247.should for ever answer with the burgesses of Bristol, beforethe king's justices when and as the burgesses of Bristol did,and not elsewhere, &c.Considering the manner in which Radcliffe had been previouslyreceived as separated from the borough, and includedin the county, and is here again added to the borough,it is impossible not to infer that in both instances, the inhar Inhabitants.bitantSy and the inhabitants only, were the persons affectedby those grants : and it would want more than a usual share ofcredulity, to imagine that they could in any manner be eithernon-residents, . or a selected corporation, including only aportion of the inhabitants, and excluding theresa. " ^Henry III. also in this year, confirmed to the burgesses of '262.Bristol and their heirs, the charter of John, when Earl ofMoreton.*The king also granted to the burgesses of Bristol — that 1^62.they and their heirs, burgesses of the same town, should beempowered from among themselves, to choose and create acoroner. That they should not forfeit their goods, for thefaults of their servants ; and that goods of intestate shouldRot. Cart. 36 Henry III. m. 6.{460 r BRISTOL.Hen. lily not be forfeited. That they should have and hold all theirliberties and free customs, as quietly and fully as the citizensof London or others of the realm.This charter grants to the burgesses of Bristol, and theirkeirSf that they might elect a coroner from amongst themselves— the object of which was (like the general provisionsof M^jgn^L Charta,) to guard them from the exactions of thej officers appointed by the crown. The inference, that thej " burgesses" were the " inhabitants'* — and not " non-residentfreeholders" or " corporate freemen"-^i& here again supported.Because it would have been absurd, to have appointeda non-resident burgess to such an office as that ofcoroner. Another inference against the freeholders, and infavour of the inhabitants, arises from the grant being expresslymade to the burgesses, and their heirs, being burgessesof the town — a qualification which would have been quiteunnecessary, had freeholders been entitled to be burgesses,because then, their heirs would necessarily be so. And thepassage strongly imports, that there was some mode by whicha person would cease to be a burgess ; which, from the generaltenor of the charter, may be assumed to be by non-residence.It should also be remembered, that the privileges granted^by this charter, were confined to the town and its liberties.1226. Henry III. also granted to the burgesses of Bruges, in thenorth county of Salop,* that no sheriff should enter against them ;except for the pleas of the crown, and by the reeve of theborough.The king also granted to the burgesses and their heirs,that they might have a mercatorial guild, with a hanse andother customs and liberties to that guild belonging; andthat no one, who of that guild should not be, any merchandisein the aforesaid borough should make, within the wallsor without, unless by the consent of the same burgesses.Also, that if any other native should hold land in theborough, and should be in the aforesaid guild and of thehanse, and in lot and scot, with the burgesses for one yearand one day, without claim — ^from thenceforward, he shouldVide Mag. Char, et Rot. Cart. 11 Henry 111. m. 11. t Glanville.^1BRIDGENORTH.-SAUSBURY* \ 461not be restored to his lord, but should remain free in the ^^^' ^^^'same borough. It was also granted to the burgesses of ^ ,Bruges and their heirs, that they should have soc and sac, tolland them, and infangthef ; that they should be free, throughall the land, of toll, passage, &c. &c., and all other customs.The charter of Bridgeport, like many we have seen beforein former reigns, exempts the burgesses from the interferenceof the sheriff; thus giving them a separate jurisdiction — anda reeve of their own. The privileges were granted to them and 'their heirs; and consequently, negatives the existence, at 'that time, of any corporation.It grants a merchant guild separately from the other privileges,as we have had frequent occasion to point out before. 'Adopting the law as to villains in Glanville, to whichwe have before referred — founding their right to befree, upon their residing in the town — paying scot and lot, .for a year and a day — and being in the guild. When theybecame free, they would, as a consequence of the law, beentitled, and bound to be burgesses ; by being sworn, and enrolledat the court leet, as resiants in the borough. How thetrading in the guild for more than a year and a day, was evidenceof a person being free, has been previously explained. yIn 1the 1 1th year of 1this reign, 1there was a charter granted by 1226.King Henry to the church of Salisbury,* reciting the translate " "^'tion of the church, from the castle to a lower situation ; and ,that the first stone of it had been laid. The bishop f and his ,successors, were to have all the liberties which they had by ,the charters of the king's ancestors. And the king further .granted, that the place which was called New Salisbury, \should be a free city ; that the citizens dwelling there, should jbe free of toll and other customs; and have all other liberties, /Uke those of Winchester. Provision is made for fortifyingthe town ; but the citizens are prohibited from giving, selling,or mortgaging their burgages to any religious persons,without the consent of the bishop, who was enabled to takea talliage, or reasonable aid, when the king made a talliagein his demesne. Provision was also made, with respect to« Rot. Cart. 11 Henry III. in. 15.462 SALISBURY.^^°* ^^^' <vay8, bridges, and. merchants; and markets were also grantedsto the bishop and his successors.This charter requires observation, as it fixes the periodwhen New Sanim was first founded. It also shews what privilegeswere granted to it, at the time of its creation. There isno pretence for saying, that it was either a city or boroughbefore this period. It was not mentioned in Domesday ; andI we have the date of its foundation, which, being within thetime of legal memory, there can be no grounds for asserting,that it was a corporation hy prescription.It should be remarked, as a confirmation of the term*^ successors" being applied at that period only to ecclesiasticalbodies, and not to citizens or burgesses — that thenumerous other charters which were granted in this reign,were all made to the burgesses and their heirs ; but this being:to the bishop is to him and his successors which termoccurs repeatedly throughout the charter.The city was to be free, with all the privileges ofthat of Winchester; and was, therefore, to be exempt fromshires and hundreds and to have an exclusive jurisdictionseparate from the county. The burgages of the citizens werealso mentioned.It is a striking circumstance, strongly illustrative of theirregularity and anomalous nature of the notions which havebeen entertained, with respect to the effect of ancient charters,that the two places of Old and New Sarum, are so directlyopposed to each other, on the two important points of burgagetenure and corporate rights. We have seen in the reignof King John, that a charter was granted to the burgesses ofSalisbury (which, as New Sarum was not then created,could only have been Old Sarum), granting them a mediatorialguilty which is said, by Brady and others, to create acorporation : — ^and yet, there is no trace of any ever havingexisted in Old Sarum, but the burgesses were always consideredto be the burgage tenants.On the contrary, in New Sarum there was no grant of amediatorial guild ; but the burgages of the burgesses werementioned. Yet, the buigessHship there has never been -BATH. &c. i 463ordered to be connected with burgage tenure — but has been ^^''' presupposedto be connected with the corporation. 'There were also granted in this reign, charters to the followingplaces.To the burgesses of Bedford and their heir, their town at Bedford,fee-farm.* ^ ^\A writ to the justices itinerant, ordering that the citizens ^****- \of Bath should enjoy their liberties, which they had ancientlyens eyed ;t and also a confirmation of the charter of Richard I. . ^ ^In the 40th of Henry III., another charter was granted 1256. \^to the citizens of Bath and their heirs that they might havereturn of writs, and that no sheriiT or bailiff should interferewith them. — that they might choose coroners from amongstthemselves; — and provision is made as to those who dietestate or intestate, — and that the citizens might hold theirliberties as the city of London, or any others.Which charter was confirmed by Edward I., Edward II.,Edward HI., Richard II., Henry IV., and Henry V.Tht freemen of Kingston-upon Thames and their heirs re- receiveda charter, that neither they nor their goods should be u^^"'arrested for any debt, in Tvhich they were not sureties or ^ ***"»*••principal debtors ; — ^to have an eight days* fair — the return ofall writs — a guild-merchant, as the men of Guildford — andthat the men of the town might create coroners, &c.A charter, confirmed the grant by King John to the bur ^227.gesses of Shrewsbury and their heirs, of the town and hundred bory.'*at fee-farm : — and added that the men of the hundred, whowere in lot and scot with the burgesses, might be participatorswith them in aids and talliages.

Here it is most clearlyobvious that it was so : — ^because it has been before seen —that Portsmouth was a borough in the reign of Richard I. ;and that privileges and exemptions were granted to theburgesses in that and the succeeding reigns, long beforethey had any guild-merchant ; and by the above charter theguild-merchant is given as a distinct and separate thing.Guildford This king granted to the good men of Guildford and theirheirs that the county court of Surrey should for ever beheldin the town of Guildford ; and that the justices itinerantshould hold the pleas of the county, and assises of all thecounty in that town.

IThis charter is decisive to show, that the law was the samein Ireland as in England — ^that none could enjoy the libertiesof the place, unless they were actually resident there, and paidscot and lot. And the expression of '' levant and couchant'will be found to be the same terms used in Bracton, forthe purpose of describing the actual residence of the villainsof the lords.Another charter was also granted by this king to Waterfordyy 123] .in the 16th year of his reign: — whereby he gave to the citizensand their heirs the city at fee-farms That they should notplead without the walls ; — ^that they and their heirs shouldbe quit of murder ; — that no citizen should make duel, butmight purge himself by the oaths of 24 lawful men ; — ^that noforced lodgings should be taken within the city ; — freedomfrom toll, lastage, &c. ; — that they should be amerced accordingto the law of the hundred ; — have assise of bread andale ; — that the hundred should be holden once a week ; —Rot.

The reeve of thecity is mentioned several times ; and the provision as toselling fine by retail, as in the charter of Dublin, was introduced.No strainer merchant should remain in the city longerthan 40 days, unless by the will of the citizens. That theymight marry their sons, daughters, &c. That they mighthave their reasonable guilds, as the burgesses of Bristol. Andtheir lands might be disposed of, by the common assent ofthe citizens ; to be held in free burgage. No templars orhospitallers were to be exempt from the common customsof the city.It then refers to the charter of King John, with respect tothose who had lands without the walls, who were to answerfor their lands as others ; and to do the common customs ofthe same city, as other citizens; and, in conclusion, theprivileges were granted to them and their heirs.ito' Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, Marshal of England, grantedNew Rosa, that the burgesses of Ross should have all the freedom ofAnna J Kilkenny j and Wexford; with the usual provisionagainst merchant strangers selling by retail, or having atavern of wines, except in a ship, unless they were of scot andlot with the burgesses of the town. And no merckemtstranger should buy within the borough of a strange manmerchandise ; but only of the said burgesses, unless he^ ^ should be of scot and lot with the burgesses.So also, no foreign merchant should remain in the town ofRoss, but for forty days; and if he should wish to delaylonger, he should only remain by the consent of the commonaltyof the borough, to the profit of the town.He also granted that the burgesses should be able tomake burgesses, if their tenements be 20 feet, so that theymight have common liberty with the other burgesses.Also, that the burgesses and their heirs, might hold freelyand quietly for ever their burgages with the appurtenances,for the vent, which had been fixed to be I2d. yearly.1225.

That the burgessesshould have a guild-merchant, with the hanse, and otherliberties and free customs, to that guild belonging : and thatnobody who was not of that guild should merchandise in theborough, unless at the will of the burgesses. — He also grantedto the burgesses and their heirs, that they might have socand sac, toll and them, and infangthef ; and that they mightbe free of toll, lastage, &c.

That no person should make hostelwithin the borough. And that right should be done to them,as to all their lands, according to the custom of the borough.The charter also makes the usual provisions as to bail andtrade; and provides, that the hundred should be held atDrogheda, once in every 16 days.Also, that they should make provosts from themselves,annually, whomsoever they would. That the common councilof the burgesses should elect two of the more lawful and discreetmen, to elect two persons to hold pleas of the crown.The fishery was also granted to them, as they had beenaccustomed to have.

That the hundred be kept once a ¥Peek, with theusual provisions as to debts— pledges-and foreignmerchants,who were not to remain there more than 40 days. Also theusual provisions as to wills and intestate, and the marriagesof sons, daughters and widows. That they might have theirreasonable guilds, as the burgesses of Bristol. Their landswere to be held in free burgage, that is to say, by the serviceoflandrgabh. That there should be only one templar or hospitallerwithin the city. And the charter of King John wasconfirmed.The Earl of Pembroke, also granted in this reign, to theKilkenny, burgesses of Kilkenny , that they should hold in peace theirburgages J which they held without claim for a year.Considering the adoption of the material clauses ofMagna Charta in Ireland — the similarity of the chartersof that country with those of England — particularly theexpress reference to the customs and charters of Bristol—it is impossible not to arrive at the conclusion, that theboroughs \n Ireland were of the same description, as thoseRot.

And in the 20th sectionrelating to counties, hundreds, and courts of freeholders, itis directed that the courts should be held by the suitors;and the like in cities, boroughs and franchises, and in thecourts of the sheriff, or in view of frankpledge or in otbefCourts.Sec. 3.

The 17th section speaks of thefts by those who did notdwell in boroughs or cities : — ^which is said to be particularlyalluded to, because in cities and boroughs the governmentwas so well regulated, that such offences were there soondiscovered.As a proof that at this time duties generally crete personal,and to be exercised in places where the individuals dwelt,Sec. 16. in the 16th section of the 21st chapter, it is directed, '^ that'' it should be inquired concerning sheriff or bailiffs who'< have summoned upon juries and inquests, persons not resindent in the county." Scotedes are also directed to beinquired into, as well as the periods of holding the latent,and view of frank-pledge. — And direct reference is made to theGreat Charter.Cap. 25. In the 25th chapter, the imprisonment of freemen whichwas contrary to the Great Charter, is mentioned. With thisobservation of the recognition of the liberi homines of thecommon law, we shall close our extracts from Britton.• 3 inst. 134.BR ACTON.— VILLAINAGE. 479Hen. in.Bacon.Bractoiiy who like Britton, composed in this re%ii his'treatise on the laws and customs of England, first gives thistries division of persons, — in conformity with the Saxonlaws — that " they are either free or slaioeB ;"* (liberi aut servi.)And in the same chapter he treats at length of those whoare native slaves (native,) and those who are free bybirth.He appears to solve the difficulty, which is found inGlanville, as to the freedom or villainage of children, bornof ^ free mother, and a father who is a villain: for he says,that it is sufficient if the mother is free. This explains thecircumstance met with in many boroughs, that marrying afree woman, made the children free, and in some instanceseven the husband : — the latter probably being attributable tothe increasing disposition to encourage emancipation, whichis put upon broader grounds in Bracton than in Glanville ;and probably this greater liberality, apparent in Bracton,still further increased in subsequent times.In the following chapter, the dependent state of the slaves ^^p- '^-is described. In that succeeding, the termination of the power ^^'of parents over their children is mentioned* One beii^ bythe death of the father, upon which his sons became sui Father.juris.The modes of emancipation are also stated ; — as when afather sends his son from him with a portion of his inheritance:— Or he becomes of full age. - // ^^^''The means of manumissions are also defined. Slaves are . ' ^under the power of their lords, as long as they are dwelling invillainage, levant and couchant, or hold the land. Those whogo about the country, still continue slaves as long as theyare in. the habit of returning; — but when they cease to doso, they are taken to be fugitives. If they are vagrants, asmerchants or mercenaries, they pay a certain sum, as acknowledgmentof their subjection ; but when they cease topay it, they also become fugitives. If by any of these means,Lib. i. cap. 6.480 BRACTON.— Villeinage-TENURE.rH*'"*^^^' they quit their lands they ought immediately to be pursuedand sought for, within the third or fourth day, till they areretaken and brought back. Nor ought any one to hinderthem, by reason of any privilege or liberty; because thelord always retains his dominion over them, until he loses itby negligence or violent resistance ; and when he who is pursuedcannot resist, then it behoves him to return to his superior.If the fugitive returns to his villainage within nyear the lord may seize him, because, before a completeyear, he can have no privilege. And if the lord should withina year make his claim, and the fugitive should return afterthe year, the lord may retain him. Nor will the time runagainst the lord after he has commenced a suit to enforce hisclaim; by continuing which, the emancipation may beavoided. But if the lord is negligent in his suit, or in enteringhis claim, then if the fugitive returns after the year itshall not be lawful for the lord to take him ; but the fugitiveshall have his privilege, and may claim to be free : and itwould be a breach of the peace for the lord to attempt toresume his slave by force.Cap. 11. In the 11th chapter, an important distinction is takenbetween those who are slaves by condition, and those whoholding by villain services, are only villains by reason of thetenure of their lands. And a species of tenure by villain services,by which some held, who were not in villainage, norslaves but by a certain convention or agreement, which theymade with their lords ; of whom some had charters or deeds,and others not. These probably were in ancient times,(and are still in Cornwall,) called conventional tenants.And there are also free tenants.We have before observed, that freedom was not ascertainedby tenure alone ; — so ih^i freemen were not to be confined tofreeholders. Indeed, tenure did not materially affect thisLib. ii. question ; because it is distinctly laid down by Bracton in*^' • his 8th chapter, "that the tenement neither confers nordetracts from the person." In the same chapter, it is afterwardssaid, '^ that the tenement does not change the state oftheyre^otan, any more than the slave:" — the distinction beingBRACTON.-UNIVERSITAS. 481Inde between that which he performs by reason of his tenure, ll|cn^ni.and that which he does by reason of his person.In confirmation of the inclination of the law to extend :freedom, we should observe — ^that it is declared, if a lordcontracts with his servant, he tacitly renounces the objectionto the contract, that the party was his villain ; — ^nor can he defendhimself by saying, that he was ignorant of it ; becausehe ought to know the condition of him with whom he contracts.The 24th chapter of the second book describes the king Lib. ii.as having the full right of determining what jurisdictionsthere should be, and the general care of the peace. Thefruits of soc, sac, view of frank-pledge, toll, them, judgmentof life and death, and all other things which belongto the execution of judgment are considered. — And it is King's'grant.there distinctly laid down, " that the king cannot of right t ichange that liberty which he had granted. ' 'In the same chapter, the term " universitas " is applied to umverfitwcities and boroughs. — But although it is borrowed from thecivil law, it does not seem to import more, than the aggregatebody of the citizens and burgesses. In a subsequent partof the chapter, the word ancestors," is applied to the citizensand burgesses. But subsequently a less equivocal term is used ;and the burgesses are said to hold the borough to themselvesand their heirs; being the usual mode of granting the chartersin this reign.In the second chapter of the third book, the Cinque Ports ]^^' "^are mentioned — also Yarmouth in Norfolk — and Dunwich. ^nquePorts.There is also a writ directed to the bailiffs of Hastings, thatthey should be at Shepway, and that they should summonthere 24 honest and discreet men of Hastings, &c. Similarwrits were directed to the bailiffs of Romual, Hey, Dore,and Sandy. From contentions which had often arisen betweenthe men of the said ports, and the men of Gememuth,and Norwich, a writ was directed to the sheriffs of Norfolkand Suffolk, to make known to the men of Jememewe, andthe bailiffs of Donewiz : so that if any one wished to complainof any thing, which had been done concerning the liberty, orwithin the liberty of the five ports, he should be before thejustices at Shepway.VOL.

But it should be diligently inquired respectinghim who fled, whether he be mfree^ledge and decenna — andthen the decenna shall be amerced, because they have not themalefactor to j justice. But if such person be received withoutbeing in pledge, the town shall be amerced, unless he who fled,was not found to be in decenna, or frank-pledge.

And so it is to be observed of all others whoare of the manupast of any one — because every man, whetherhe 18 a free or bond-man, either is, or ought to be in frankpledge,or of some manupast ; — sunless there should be any onetravelling from place to place, and who does not hold himselfmore to one than another ; or has something which would sufficefor a free-pledge, as dignity or order, or free tenement, orinthe city, things immoveable. — according to the lawsof King Edward, which are expressly mentioned, every oneof twelve years of age, ought to make his oath in the view offrank-pledge, that he neither would be a robber, nor assist arobber. And every one ought to be in frank-pledge, who holdsland and a house, which they call ^* hasfastene," — that is,householder — and so also others who serve them, whom theycall followers, (folgheres^) or family servants, because no oneought to send his servant away, before he has been poised ofall claims, with which he has been before charged. And he isof the manupast and family, who is at board and clothing; or atboard only, with wages, as a menial and hireling of the house.Also according to the ancient custom, they are called of thefamily, who have been guests for three nights, '^uncuth,''"gust," and "hoghenehyne." In fine, any one can receiveanother in frank-pledge, according to his own will — but hecannot dismiss him from frank-pledge : — nor vice versa as itseems, when any one has placed himself in frank-pledge ofanother, or in decenna, or was before sued with the decenna,he cannot withdraw himself when he likes.Here we have a full account of that system of nationalpolice, which we have before seen, was in existence in thetime of our Saxon ancestors, carefully continued down tothis period. It appears to have been considerably amplified,and minutely defined — though the same in principle. We 'have the liberties of soc, sac, toll and them, referred to—which are more expressly mentioned again, in the 35th Cap. 35.chapter of the same book. The intelligent reader will not ^ii/484 BRACTON.— INHABITANTS.^^°- ^^^' fail to observe, that the principles of admitting in frankpledgeevery person, either by his own pledges, or the pledgeand security of his lord, as we have frequently described, is.-— here most thoroughly and satisfactorily explained.sap. 11.

The illegal establishment of a new market, to the injuryCap. 46. of liberties before granted, is provided for, in the 46thchapter.Men of We frequently find in the charters, the expression of menrough. of the borough (homines de hugo) ; and we have contended,that it means '^ the men inhabiting within the borough :"it is scarcely possible to give it any other application.Although this is drawing an inference, to establish an importantpoint, from a single expression — yet it is justifiable to doso, where the term is clear and distinct, and no other meaningcan properly be applied to it. This observation is the moreto be relied upon, with reference to any subject matter,when a more precise form of expression is not to be expected.And this is the case as to all things of ordinary and constantBRACTON.occurrence, with respect to which, it would rather create y^" - ^^^doubt and suspicion, that any particular expression shouldbe applied to them. These observations, the common experienceof mankind will justify.The proper mode of considering this point will be, byexclusively reverting to that period of our history, whenthose expressions were adopted, and considering the countryas divided into shires, hundreds, and boroughs, — ^to form thebest judgment we can of the manner in which they woulddescribe the persons belonging to either of those divisions.It is obvious, that the natural description would be, " themen of that place," — " homines de comitatu" — " dehundred" — " de burgh;" — expressions we have so constantlyoccurring. Bracton, in his book of the Writ of Right, isetting forth the form of the writ to bailiffs of a borough, i-ib.v.cap. 2.describes the plaintiff by this simple description, " A. de fol. 329:tali villa."At these periods, no one would have dreamt of describinga person living in a particular place, as an inhabitant there,because nobody would have doubted that fact ; and thereforewe find, from the earliest times to a considerably advancedperiod in our history, that the word inhabitants is neverused — but the more simple description, we have commentedupon, of " the men of the city or boroughs'We have now completed our extracts from the statutes, Conclusioncharters, and laws, which occur in this reign — correctlytermed, troublesome and irregular : but yet, notwithstandingalmost all other things were changed, the boroughs and theirburgesses still continued the same.For the purpose of exacting money from them, their rightswere frequently called in question — and sometimes seizedinto the king's hands — but upon the fine demanded beingpaid, they were usually re-granted in the same form in whichthey existed before. We may therefore assume, that theywere, after every effort to defeat them, restored to theiroriginal state. The condition of the boroughs and the burgessesat that time, must not be considered as a matter which486 CONCLUSION.Hea. Ill, passed without canvass or investigation ; but rather asrights attempted to be disputed — but which after controversywere firmly established : and, notwithstanding allthe attempts made upon them, they still continued to bepossessed of their rights — ^for the burgesses and their Aeir$jwithout any incorporation — and without its ever having beensuggested that they required a corporate title to enjoythem. We may therefore again, at the close of this longand turbulent reign, assert with increased confidence, thatposition we have maintained throughout our investigation ofthe charters — that the burgesses were the inhabitants pendingscot and lot, sworn at the court leet, and enrolled there ; —and that they were not incorporated; — and that they did nothold by succession, but hereditarily, to them and their heirs.It must also be remembered, that this is nearly 100 yearswithin the time of legal memory ; and therefore leaves thepoint indisputable — that there are ko corporationsBT prescription.Before, however, finally quitting this reign, the attentionof the reader should be drawn to the attempts made by thisking to strengthen his power, and to facilitate the raisingof his supplies, by adding to his great council representativesof the local divisions of the country.1243. In the 27th year of his reign, being offended with theconduct of some of his barons, he attempted to form acouncil of a part only of the tenants in capite, omitting tosummon others.* The barons who assembled, broke up inanger, and declared themselves an incompetent assembly toproceed upon public business, because the other barons hadnot been summoned.1254. Disappointed in this respect, about 10 years after, the kingsummoned four knights from each county to the council,to inform him what voluntary aid each particular countycould afford him in his great necessity, towards the defenceofOascoigne.1261. And in this year, the three knights, who had been sum-matthewParis. See also before, William I.HOUSE OF COMMONS. 487money from each county by the barons, to meet at St. Hen. ill.Allan's, were ordered, by writs, to repair to Winds.*We ought to observe, that in none of these writs werecitizens or burgesses mentioned ; and therefore, whateveropinions might have been entertained to the contrary, it isclear that the citizens and burgesses were not represented inParliament, before, or at this period. But the king, findinghimself embarrassed with his barons, began first, by summoningthe knights from the several counties. And soonafter, we shall perceive the expedient was also resorted to,of summoning the citizens and burgesses.Thus a few weeks after the issuing of the writs we havelast mentioned, others were directed to the barons of Sandwichand Winchelsea; but it does not appear that theyextended farther. When the Earl of Leicester was desi- ^^^'rous of strengthening his power, as opposed to the king, heimproved upon the example which had been afforded him,and issued writs for summoning, not only the knights fromthe shires, (giving writs also for their expenses,) but also,for the first time, citizens burgesses^ and barons of theCinque Ports The writs being directed immediately to thecitizens and burgesses^ and neither to the sheriffs of thecounties, nor the mayors, bailiffs, nor chief officers of the citiesor boroughs]:It appears that no writ was issued at .this period to thecitizens of London — their liberties being at that time seizedinto the hands of the king, for having sided with the barons.A strong instance, particularly at that period, of the effectproduced upon a borough by the seizure of its liberties.Thus we find the first summons of citizens and burgessesto Parliament, though hot immediately continued,commencing at a time when the real character of the burgessescannot be doubted, and when they clearly were notincorporated.2 Prynne, Brew.

'^^ great charters so frequently renewed in this reign, andChip. 1. many of the other statutes, were, amongst other importantmatters, directed against the extortions of the sheriffs.Cap. 23. ^^ chapter 23, the clause so frequent in the charters, thatpersons should not be distrained for any debt for which theywere not debtors or pledges, is made the subject of a generalenactment by the legislature.^ Trading towns are mentioned in this statute as separatefrom cities and boroughs!'^ — and we have before shown in-1278. stances, and more could be added if necessary, to establishMerchant that there are grants of merchant guilds to places which^"* *' were never considered as boroughs ; therefore, Brady's assertionthat these trading guilds were the foundation ofboroughs, seems to be totally unfounded and gratuitous.statute The Statute of Gloucester provides for the claim of Ulou- .center. chases — and for their seizure into the king's hand, in case theclaim should not be established — subject to be replevied ifit could be shown that their ancestors had died seized of thefranchises. In the form of the writ, which is afterwards directed,the view of frank-pledge in a manor is given as theinstance of a franchise — as well as the holding of a hundred.Cap. 12. In the 12th chapter, the mayor and bailiffs of Londonare mentioned — and the vouching oi foreigners to warranty.• 2 Inst. p. 278.STATUTES.-FOREIGNERS.-MORTMAIN. 489The amendment of this chapter, in the ninth year of this ^^^^l-reign, applies to the same subject, and the partie were to 1281.be summoned to the hustings to receive the judgment ofthe court.The term foreigners frequently occurs — as we have seen in Foreigner*.early chapters, and in the most ancient bye-laws and documentsof most of the boroughs.It is here used with reference to London, but in LordCoke's comment upon this statute, it appears that this wordwas by no means confined to cities or boroughs, but wasapplied also to counties, and consequently foreign vouchers,in foreign counties are spoken of, which cannot but meanpersons inhabiting or residing in other counties than thosein which the proceedings were pending. In the samemanner, and by analogy, there can be no doubt but thatforeigner," originally, and in the words of this statutemeant, a person residing out of the bounds or liberty of thecity or borough ; and not an alien only, as has been mistakenlyassumed.We have seen, in some of the preceding charters, parti ^^J^^**'clearly those relative to Ireland, that religious persons wereprohibited, except under restrictions as to number, from 1279.residing in cities and boroughs; thus we find also, thatin the recital of this first statute of mortmain, it is stated, Mortmain.that of late it was provided, — religious men should notenter into the fees of any without the licence of the chieflord. Nevertheless, such religious men have entered, aswell into their own fees, as into the fees of other men,appropriating and buying them, whereby the services whichat the beginning were provided for the defence of the realm,were wrongfully withdrawn. It was, therefore, provided,'^ that no person, religious or other whatsoever, is to buy'^ or sell any lands whereby they may come into mortmain."From which it is clear, that the doctrine of taking landsto-religious persons by perpetual succession, preventing allchance of escheat, was at that time known, and had acquiredthe term of mortmain. But it does not appear that such490 STATUTES.— INHABITANTS.fcdwaid I. doctrine had been applied to cities or boroughs — perhapsupon tlA ground that they were granted for the public good,and that the king, as the chief lord, concurred in the grant,thereby consenting to the waiving of the escheat, as requiredby the 34ih Edward I., sect. 3. And therefore, although thesame effect was produced by the grant in perpetuity to the inhabitants,the same practical inconvenience did not arise fromit, nor was it at that time considered as a grant in mortmain.1285. The 13th chapter of this statute relates to the order of\^^miQ- ^^^ indictment, taken in the sheriff's taunif and is directedsecond? ^i^i^st the exactions of the sheriffs, and provides, that theinquest shall be taken by 12 lawful men at the least ; andat the conclusion of the chapter, it is added, '^ so shall it beobserved of every bailiff of franchise ;" — ^which clearly appliesto the courts leet.The 38th chapter of the same statute, relative to juries,recites, ** that sheriffs, hundreds, and bailiffs, harass those** who are under them by putting in assises and juries'< men not dwelling in the county at the time of the summons."It then provides, that no more than 24 shall besummoned : — and exempts, amongst others, those not dwelling in the county. With the exception only of knightsnot resident in the county, upon the ground of necessity,arising from their scarcity. And even those knights are requiredto have land in the shire.inhabitants From thcsc enactments, it appears, that in this respect,as in others we have frequently had occasion to remark, allpublic duties were to be discharged by the inhabitants in theplaces where they resided.Cap. 39. "^^ 20^ chapter relates to the return of writs, stating that^^ vVrUs?^ the sheriffs often returned, they had commanded the bailifisof some liberties who did nothing, and often naming thoseliberties that had never the return of writs ; wherefore it is directed,that the sheriff shall deliver a roll of all the libertiesin the shire, which have the return of writs.Hence we may infer, in confirmation of the charters beforecited, that the great distinction which at that period, separatedthe boroughs and other liberties from the jurisdictionStatutes.— INHABITANTS. . 491of the sheriff, was the possession of that privilege so often ^^"^^^'repeated in the charters — " of having the return of iltits."The second chapter of the statute of Winter, which re- ^^Jj^^^ 'lated to the liability of the county for felons, provides thatevery county, that is to say, the men dwelling in the county,are to answer for them, with the franchises, within 40 days.In the fourth chapter, the liability of hosts for their guests, Cap. 4.which we found in the Saxon laws, and in the compilationsof Bracton and Britton, is expressly recognized ; as well asthe foreign of towns, the places without their jurisdiction.The bailiffs are every week, or at least every 16 days, tomake inquiry of all persons who died in the suburbs orforeign ; and of strangers or suspicious persons.Provision is made for six men in every city, to keep atevery gate ; in every borough, 12 men ; and in every town,six or four, according to the number of inhabitants of thetown, — ^and they shall watch the town continually all night.Strangersyrere to be arrested, and the hue and cry was directed.The being supplied with arms for the preservation of the Cap. 6.peace,— respecting which they are to be sworn, is providedfor in the sixth chapter, much in the same manner as in thelaws of Henry II. In conformity with the Saxon laws, provisionis also made against lodging strangers in blandishtowns. The sheriffs and bailiffs within their franchises,are to take heed that the hue and cry is duly made, 'and thedefaults in it are to be presented by the constables.In these important provisions, we perceive, that the systemof our Saxon ancestors is continued — ^that all duties and responsibilitiesare connected with local residence — ^that thegreat object of the provisions, was the securing an efficientlocal police; and that all the burdens connected with it,would rest upon the inhabitants of the shires and franchisesrespectively; so that the distinction between the shiresand the franchises or boroughs, appears to be clearly definedand recognized, and the inhabitants of each respectively,would be bound to carry the law into execution in theirrespective districts.The statute of quo warranto, relative to liberties claimed ^'^^'492 STATUTES-INHABITANTS.^^"<^ ^ ' by prescription or grant, fixes the period of the former to anSuture enjoyment before the time of King Richard ; explainingof Quo / •' •'warranto the reason, why that period is taken generally as the time/ of legal memory. The new statute of quo warranto, is tothe same effect.The vexations which arose from persons being impannelledupon juries, out of their proper shires, may be collectedfrom the fact of another statute being made in the 21st ofthis reign, relative to this subject, restraining the bailiffs,Statute 1 sheriffs, and stewards from putting any persons on recognizancethat should pass out of their proper counties exceptthey have lands and tenements to the yearly value of 100*.;saving amongst others, that ** in cities, boroughs, and other** market towns, where inquest do pass upon any matter'* touching them, it shall be done as has been accustomed."inhabitants That the inhabitants both in the counties and the boroughs,were, at this time, the persons who did the public acts, maybeinferred from the fact, that the persons who by the articulisuper charta, were to be appointed for the purpose of securingthe observance of the great charters, were to beelected by the " commonalty of the shire," — clearly meaningall the people or inhabitants of the shires.Cap. 7. The seventh chapter of the same statute prohibits theconstable of the castle of Dover y from holding any plea of aforeign county within the castle gate, except it should be thekeeping of the castle ; nor should distrain the inhabitants ofthe cinque portly to plead any other where, or otherwise thanthey ought after the form of their charter, obtained of theirking for their old franchises confirmed by the Great Charter.w^Ilh^te ^^^ articles of inquiry upon the statute of Winchester,um, relate amongst other things, to the keeping of the gates ofcities and great boroughs and strangers being lodged in thesuburbs and foreign of the town — the keeping of the watch,and that all between the age of 15 and 60, be sworn to keepthe peace.So that we find from all these statutes, the ancient systemof law was continued unaltered and unimpaired.• 2 Inst. 539.HOUSE OF COMMONS. 493It is unnecessary here to repeat the observations previously Edward I.made upon its simplicity — purity — and efficacy. But merelynoting its long unchanged existence point out at thisperiod the great change which, for the purpose of obtaininga more ready assent to the supplies made necessary by the 'long continued wars and dissensions, was effected in theconstitution, by adding to the other rights of burgesses, theimportant privilege of being represented in Parliament ; to^which we shall now advert, before we proceed to cite the fewcharters necessary to illustrate this reign ; because it will beimportant for' the reader to observe distinctly, that althoughthis additional privilege was conceded to them, their otherrights were left untouched ; nor was the cIclss of personswho formed the burgesses, in any respect varied or affected.It was in the 23rd year of this reiffn, that the first partial 1294.nectary writs issued, and 120 cities and boroughs, or more, *"y W"^-were summoned to send members to Parliament. The sheriffbeing directed to return two knights for each shire — twocitizens for each city — and two burgesses from each borough,within his bailiwick.*These writs were all in the same form, and of the samedate, except that to the city of LondonerIt will be observed, that the vats were directed to theburgesses then existing Those burgesses, as we have shownbefore, were the inhabitants paying scot and lot, sworn andenrolled at the court leet — and we must assume that thecitizens, and burgesses, returned to Parliament accordingto this new summons ordered by the king, were elected bythat class of persons.There is now no direct proof from the writs, or returns, ofthe manner in which the members for cities and boroughswere elected ; because, generally speaking, and with theparticular exception of London, the return from which wassomewhat fuller, the names of the representatives were merelyendorsed upon the writ, with the addition of the names oftwo manufactory, who were responsible for their appearancein Parliament.Rot. Glass, m. 4, don. t Prynne, part ii., p. 39.494 HOUSE OF COMMONS.Edward I. Notwithstanding the burgesses of Buckingham are referredBuck to in Domesday it is observable that the sheriff of Buckinghamreturns — ^that there are no citizens or burgesses in Uscounty — ^nor cities — ^nor boroughs— on account of which, hecannot return any citizens or bui^sses.We have seen before that the other Buckinghamshireboroughs were subsequently created ; and the probability is,that either Buckingham had ceased at that time, to exercisethe privileges of a borough in the manner we havebefore generally described, or that it had been seized intothe king's hands.*There were also similar returns for Rutland — westmoreland— Lancaster — Lincoln.But none were made by the constable for Marlborough,nor by the bailifis of the liberties of Calne or Worthy.There is some variety in the words and form of the returnsfor the counties, as we have seen in the words of charters,though they all, no doubt, in effect, meant the same.Thus, some of the knights are stated to be elected by thewhole county " — others, in the " full county court "others,by the ** whole commonalty oftJie county as Ck>mwall.In Dorset, and Somerset, the returns are — ^in the '^ fullcounty courts by the whole commonalty'*The return of Nottingham was by the ** common assent ofthe tovni" — and the same for Hereford.In illustration of the observation we have before made,that the return of writs was one of the distinguishing marksof a borough — ^that of Derby is said to be made by thebailiff, who has the full return of writs. And the bailifis ofYarmouth were also described as having the return of writs —but they made no answer to the sheriffs precept.The general observation which would result from thedate of these returns is — that as we have shown there can beno municipal corporation by prescription those bodies beingfirst created long within the time of legal memory, so itr is clear, that there could be no prescriptive right of electingmembers for cities, and boroughs — because the right to♦ Prynne, part ii., 41- f Prynne, part ii. 43.m ■« mmHOUSE OF COMMONS. 495return members also, originated thus far within the limits of ^^^^ ^'legal prescription.As the present subject of our inquiry is rather the municipal,than the parliamentary nature of boroughs and burgesses,we shall not here further pursue that part of our subjsect. Nor is the question with respect to the right of electionof any importance to our inquiry-otherwise than as establishingby whom that important act was done — and therebyshowing, at least in that instance, who acted as burgesses.The representatives of boroughs being thus admitted intoParliament, we find their right of interference expressly recognizedby the statute of talliages, of the 34th of Edward L,where, in the 1st chapter, it is provided, that no talliage,or aid, shall be taken without the assent of the archbishops,bishops, earls, barons, knights, burgesses j and other freemenof the land.From which it seems impossible not to draw the conclusion,^that the burgesses were freemen — ^that is, the '^ liberihomines" of the common law, as contradistinguished fromvillains — and not the freemen of corporations — ^because, aswe have just observed, those bodies did not exist.The local character of the liability to serve upon juries. Juries.as well as that of the liability to all other public burdens,may be further collected from the 8th section of the Charts ^^^*de Forest, by which it is provided, that none of the officersof the forest shall be put in juries to be taken without theforest ; — ^which is founded upon the same general principleas that upon which the burgesses are exempted, viz. thatas they perform those duties at their own court of Swain-mote,*they are exempted from similar duties elsewhere.We have before seen that the corporate character of ecclesiasticalbodies was recognized at this early period ; and wehave also learnt, that common seals were used by persons. CommonSealand bodies not incorporated.In the statute 35th of Edward I., chapter 4, it is provided,that abbots, notwithstanding they had been before corporateThis word is compounded of Swain and root, or Gemot ; and signifies a courtincidental to a forest, at which the freeholders resident within it attended.496 CHARTERS.Edward I. bodies, should thereafter have a common seals which,although it had theretofore been used to remain in thecustody of the abbot, and not of the convent, should remainin the custody of the prior, and four of the most discreetmen of the convent — to be laid up in safe keeping under theprivate seal of the abbot ; — and that any other deeds afterwardssealed with any but the common seal, should be void.•CHARTERS.We now proceed to collect and consider the charters andother municipal documents which occur in this period of ourhistory./ Either this warlike king, engaged in his military exploits,j or distracted with the difficulties which surrounded himwhen he ascended the throne, granted but few chartersin the commencement of his reign — or they have been lost, or^ imperfectly recorded ; or he was at first more anxious to< seize those which had been granted by former kings, than toconcede any of his own. For in the calendar of the charter\ roUs, there are none entered in the first, and only four in thesecond year of his reign.It may however be questionable, whether there are notstill to be found by inspeximus, if not by the original charters,others which were granted in these years.Norwich. Thus in a charter of the 27th of Henry VI., one of EdwardI., granted in the second year of his reign, to thetown of Norwich is mentioned by way of inspeximus.Also a charter of the first of Edward III. contained an in-specious of a charles granted by Edward I., in the firstyear of his reign, to the University of Oxford. A variety ofsimilar instances occur, but to which it is not necessary forus more particularly to advert.UNIVERSITY AND CITY OF OXFORD.We have seen in the previous reign of Henry III. thecommencement of the disputes that had arisen between theuniversity and the respective burgesses of Oxford and Cambridge.Oxford-UNIVERSITY AND CITY. 497They seem not to have been appeased — but, on the contr ^^^"^ ^-tray, to have increased with time; for it appears, thatduring this reign, contentions frequently arose between thechancellor and scholars of the university, said the mayor andburgesses of the town.In the 22nd year, the mayor and commonalty of Oxford ^^^'were amerced, respecting the election of Henry Owen,* one ofthe comburgesses, as mayor — who it appears acted withouthaving taken the oath of office, and had levied a talliage inthe town without the king's consent, — for which he wasfined. And because the commonalty had submitted to himas mayor, the mayoralty was seized into the king's hand,and besotted to the custody of the sheriff, in the nameof the king. Another instance in which the sheriff hadthe authority over a place when the local jurisdiction hadceased.The farther history of the disputes between the burgessesand university, will also hereafter show, that thejurisdiction of the borough] was confined within its limits,and that the sheriff exercised authority without the town.The seizure of the mayoralty did not however long continue,as a writ was afterwards issued to the sheriff, for therestoration of the liberties of Oxford.But difficulties arising respecting' the conflicting juris 1274.dictions of the mayor and burgesses, with the chancellor anduniversity f it seems that the latter applied in this year to theking for a charter, — by which he granted to the scholarsof the University of Oxford, '^ that in all personal actions, theburgesses, and other municipal laity of ours at Oxford, mightbe sued before the chancellor of the same university — andno one should hinder them by our prohibition.'^fThis charter was clearly intended for the purpose of limitingthe jurisdiction of the borough, and protecting the members ofthe university from the interference of the mayor — at thesame time that it gave the chancellor authority over theburgesses.• Mad.

Discords, similar to those at Oxford, existed also betweenthe scholars and townsmen of Cambridge of which the tracesare visible in the Year Books.*1290. At the Parliament held this year, a decision respectingthe disputes between the chancellor and scholars of theuniversity, with the mayor and burgesses of the town, wasmade by the king and his council, in the presence of thechancellor and certain authorized masters — ^with the mayorand burgesses, all mutually agreeing, by the consent ofthe king, to put an end to their contentions, by stayingall actions between them. But because it appeared to theking and his council, that no individual was' excluded fromany personal action, it was provided, that neither the chancellornor scholars, nor the mayor and burgesses, should giveassistance to any person prosecuting such an action. Andif any of the former complaints should be renewed, the chancellorand scholars promised, for themselves and their successors,that no greater favour should be shown to a clerk thanto a layman.The mayor and burgesses, on their part, promised, thatthey would firmly keep all the liberties and free customswhich the chancellor and scholars had. And because itappeared to the mayor and burgesses that the chancellor andscholars abused some of the customs granted to them bycharter, and strove to use some which were not granted tothem, to the injury and disinheritance of the crown anddignity of the king — the mayor and burgesses present certainarticles to the king, to which he answers : — First — To thecomplaint, that the chancellor, at his will, had released suchpersons as the four aldermen and eight burgesses hadarrested, and had cited the aldermen and bailiffs beforehim : the king answers — That the chancellor should havecognizance of all transgressions within the town in which aclerk was one of the parties, except pleas of homicide andmayhem. That the king should know of his bailiffs whobehaved themselves in their offices otherwise than they4 Edward I. fol. 6.OXFORD.-UNIVEBSITY AND CITY. 499ought. And if the bailiffs should think themselves injured ^^"^^-by the chancellor, they might come to the king's cttirt, andthere have justice.It is then directed, that the chancellor and mayor shouldbaye cognizance of forestallers in the tom ; and the sheriff ofthe king without the town. That the forfeitures should,with the assent of the chancellor and mayor within the town,and of the chancellor and sheriff without the town, be givento the Hospital of St. John, without the East Grate, as almsof the king.To the complaint of the mayor and burgesses — that thechancellor releases those of the laity whom he has committedat so heavy a ransom, and so binds them not totransgress again, even by an obligation to pay money, so thatmany of the town are destroyed, and disinherited — the kinganswers — "that for the future the chancellor shall directreasonable amends and security as it had been thithertoaccustomed."■To another complaint, the king answers — "that the burgessesshould take no oath before the chancellor withoutsaving their fidelity to the king ; that they should not"swear that they would not make their complaints inthe king's court ; that the oath of the aldermen, of theeight, and of the fifty men of the town, should be taken as itused ; — so that the burgesses should not swear but for themselves.And the mayor was for the future,* to certify to thechancellor where the oath of the burgesses was to be taken**Concerning the complaint of the mayor and burgesses,that the chancellor and scholars had by their proctors takenthe forfeitures of unwholesome meat and fish, although theybelonged to the king and his bailiffs, without any warrant, as itis believed, and to the injury of the king and his farmers,the king directs, that — "neither the chancellor nor themayor shall take the forfeitures, but they shall jointly have'' cognizance of those matters, and the forfeitures shall begiven to the Prior of the hospital of St. John."As to the complaint, that " although by the charters noThis shows the burgesses were sworn.K R 2itit600 OXFORD.-UNIVEUSITY AND CITY.Edward. « liberties were granted to any others in the town but thescholar of the university, who were exempted from the cameunity to answer before twenty or at the same time with them,as to anything relating to the king or the community : yet thechancellor and scholars, by their proctors, appropriate tothemselves others who are not scholars — as taylors, barbers,writers, parchment-makers, and such like — ^who arenot of their jurisdiction, h\xi who have in the tow7i their tmveSf^* their families y* and their merchandises; and this to the greatloss of the king and his farmers: — it was agreed between the'^ chancellor and masters, and the mayor and burgesses, that"nobody should enjoy the liberties and privileges of the"community, but the clerks, their families and servants,parchment-makers, illuminators, writers, barbers, andother official men who were of the robes of the clerks themselves;and if they interfered in any merchandises, theyshould be malleable together with the burgesses."To another complaint, that although the mayor and burgesseshad been used to let their tenements in the town tofarm at their will, for the support of themselves and theirchildren, the chancellor and scholars do not permit them toletfor a shorter period than three years, to the great loss ofthe community ; it was answered by the king thus — ^" Theburgesses shall not be impeded by the chancellor, scholars,and proctors, from selling or letting their tenements as theywill ; so that nevertheless no fraud, collusion, or agreementshall be made, by which the clerks shall be turned out oftheir lodgings, or their lodgings be made dearer ; and also"that the clerks shall not let their lodgings first leviedagainst the usual custom.The mayor and burgesses also complained, that althoughevery free man ought to have a reasonable summons, the chancellorhad summoned them to appear in three hours, andupon default had punished and excommunicated them at hiswill ; the king orders, that " the men cormorants in the townshould for the future, be summoned for the next day and• This bIiows they were residents.t That Ibi the freemen resident there, who when sworn are the burgesses.Oxford-UNIVERSITY AND CITY. 601*^not otherwise: but vagabond men (vagabonds) shall be ^'^"^ ^'*' summoned at the will of the chancellor, and according to** what should seem reasonable to be done : and if it should** be necessary that inquisitions should be made for keeping*^ the kinff^s peace^^th^t the men commorant in the town'should come at whatever hour they were summoned."Another complaint stated — that when knights, free men,and others passing through the country are received asguests aT the houses of the burgesses of Oxford, if anyclerk of the university should wish, justly or unjustly, tobring an action against such foreigners (extraneous) for anyforeign covenant or convention made without the county(extra comitatus), the chancellor, at the complaint of theclerk, sequester the horse, equipage, and harness of suchforeigners although they should be in the service of the kingor of any nobleman. And if the host did not dare, or wasnot able to arrest or retain the goods of the foreigner beingwith the king or such nobleman, but permitted him to departfreely, the chancellor punishes him as guilty of a transgression: as to which, the king directs, that '' such personspassing through the town of Oxford, shall answer beforethe chancellor of contracts and transgressions made withthe scholars within the town of Oxford, and not of foreigncontracts and transgressions'*The mayor and burgesses also complain, that when anylayman, has been wounded by a clerk, so that his life is despairedof, the chancellor requires that the clerk should bedelivered to him, before the truth of the life and death of thewounded can be known, and excommunicates all that say tothe contrary ; and the king " enjoins the chancellor, that heshall discharge no clerk detained in prison for wound ormayhem until the certain and undoubted truth shall beknown, that the death or mayhem is not despaired of; andthe chancellor is to take care that in this respect he does"justice to all'*The last complaint which the mayor and burgesses makeis — that whereas the chancellor and scholars claim to havet That is, holding the court I«et. * See the Sax.

In thecharters themselves, it is left in doubt, whether they did thisby usurpation or by concession from the burgesses : but theaccount we here have of the disputes between the town andthe university, seems strongly to indicate, that at least manyof the privileges they had assumed were encroachments, asthe king corrects many of them. From the manner in whichthe mayor and burgesses put forward the injury whichthe king had sustained, from the usurpations of the chancellorand scholars, the fair inference would seem to be,that the university had been the most powerful body of thetwo; and that the burgesses found themselves unequal tocope with the influence of the ecclesiastical body except bythe aid of the king, stimulated to their protection by hisown interest.This document is also of considerable importance in ourpresent inquiry, as affording many inferences with respect toOxford-UNIVERSITY AND CITY. 503the condition of the burgesses at that time. For instance — ^^^^d i.the burgesses are generally described with reference to theirfamilies : — ^which, from another passage, appears to mean theirdomicile or household : — and in the description of the personsivho ought to share the privileges of the borough, and bearits burdens, as of talliage and other things, they are mentionedas having their wives, families, and merchandisethere; all of which tends to show, that the burgesses werethe permanent householders, who had their domiciles withinthe place. Their tenements are spoken of, and mentionis also made of the scholars lodging with them, which couldonly be, if they were householders. The classes of personsopposed to each other, are those who in the languageof the law, are commorant there, and vagabonds — burgessesand the passengers or foreigners who lodge in theirhouses.It is true, that reference is made as well to the merchandiseof the burgesses, as to their wives and families, which mayinduce some to think, with Dr. Brady, that burgess-ship wasconnected with trade — and, with others, that a person wasentitled to be a burgess, as was frequently contended in thecity of London, provided he had a shop and merchandisethere — although the former should be only part of a house,and the person should not reside in it. But it must be recollected,that there is nothing in this document whichshows that the having his merchandise there, was anythingmore than one of the proofs, and not the only one, ofhis being a permanent resident ; or that it was sufficient ofitself to make him a burgess : — merchandise being connectedwith his wife and fiEunily. Nor does the close of that passagego farther, than to make the attendants of the scholars subjectto be tallied with the burgesses, if they trade — but certainlynot to make them burgesses.The scholars being described as exempt from the community(communicate,) which means the community of theburgesses — it may be urged, that this use of the expressionshows that the burgesses were an incorporated body. It nodoubt proves that they were treated as an aggregate —504 ox FORD-university AND CITY.Edward I. bet qq^ ^8 a corporate body, in the modem acceptation ofthe word — as we have abundantly shown from other documents.There is no term of incorporation applied to theburgesses — ^their successors are not spoken of — and theword community is used in no other sense than when itis applied to the inhabitants at large of the realm, or of anycounty.It must be remarked, that the greater portion of thematters of dispute between the university and the mayor andburgesses, are with reference to the jurisdiction, claimed bythe one or the other ; and the constant reference to that ofthe mayor, aldermen, and burgesses, for the purpose of preservingthe peace, regulating the assise of bread and beer,and the sale of victuals, (all within the cognizance of thecourt leet,) as well as the collection of the king's firm andcustom — can leave no doubt, that the characteristic feature inthe description of a borough, is the jurisdiction it has, for thebenefit of the public, and for the purposes of good governmentand local regulation — not for the mere arbitrarycommunication of undefined privileges, to persons not residentin the places to which the charters were granted, aspractised in the present day.As to the limits of the respective jurisdictions, that of theuniversity appears to be described as rather personal thanlocal — extending to all the scholars, whether residing withinthe bounds of the borough — ^in the county— or in the surroundingvillages — provided they were really scholars — aswell as to their attendants. Whilst the local jurisdiction ofthe mayor was confined to the borough; — and all beyondwas under the jurisdiction of the sheriff.Another thing also observable in this document, is thevariety of names which were applied to the university — atonetime they are called the " chancellor and scholars" — atanother, " the chancellor, proctors, and scholars" — anotherthe " chancellor, masters, and scholars ;" and yet there canbe no doubt, but that all these terms meant the same bodyas the mayor, aldermen, and burgesses, or capital burgesses,jurats, assistants, freemen, and commonalty, in other AND CITY. 606roughs, meant also the same class of persons, though described ^'^"^^'by different names. ^As we have thus fer pursued the histories of Oxford, Cambridge,and their universities, it may be convenient to introducein this place a few documents that occur relative toOxford in the two succeeding reigns.Thus Edward II. in the eighth year of his reign, at the 1316.request of Henry de Marcia, then chancellor of Oxford, confirmedthe above ordinance in all its particulars.The same king, in the same year, also confirmed to thechancellory masters, and scholars and their successors, thecharter made in the 32d Henry III., and the privilegesgranted by it, although they should not have been used.There is a confirmation of a guild granted to the cordwainersof Oxford by Henry III., and confirmed by EdwardII.Edward III. in the first year of his reign, confirmed to the 1327.citizens of Oxford the charters of Henry III., John, Edward I.and Edward II., provided that they did not interfere with theliberties granted to the chancellor of the University.*The same king, in the 10th year of his reign, granted a 1336.charter of confirmation to the chancellor, masters, scholarsand university, at the instance of Robert de Stratford, Archdeaconof Canterbury, and the chancellor of the university,which, repeating many of the clauses of former charters, re-granted them. A clause was added which, reciting that theburgesses would not permit the sellers of woollen and linencloths to cut and sell them in parts to the scholars, but compelledthe sale of them whole— directs, that they may doso for the future without any impediment from the mayor,bailiffs and burgesses. Another clause was also added,stating the chancellor was afraid of committing to prisonoffenders in the university, lest he should afterwards beburdened in consequence of it, and indemnifying the chancellor,by protecting him as far as was in the power of theking, from all suit and molestation on that account.It may be observed of this charter, that it contains twoRot. Cart. 1 Edward III. n. 54.606 Oxford-UNIVERSITY AND CITY.provisions, the legality of which might be questioned. Thefirst takes away the prohibition in the case of the chancellor'sjurisdiction, which it would seem could not be doneexcept by the legislature ; because, as a writ of prohibitionis one to which the subject is entitled of right in cases whereit applies, the crown, although it might waive any of itsown powers, could not deprive the subject of any right helawfully enjoyed ; and it would therefore follow, that thisclause would either be useless, as having no effect at all ;or if it had any, it would then become illegal.The second clause is that which protects the chancellorfrom being called to account for the imprisonment of anyperson he might commit ; — ^a provision clearly illegal, if itwere not qualified by the restrictive words, *^ as much as inhim lies," which, in reality, makes it altogether inoperative,because the king had no power to do so.13^. It appears also, that in the 20th year of Edward III.,^^'^^^' considerable disputes and disturbances, accompanied withmuch violence, had again arisen between the members of theuniversity, and the people of the town : — ^to appease whicha charter was granted to the university, to put at rest some ofthe disputed points — ^to re^tore their liberties, which hadbeen seized into the king's hands — and to recall the scholars,many of whom it seems, had left the university.A charter was also granted to the people of Oxford, torestore their liberties, which appear to have been seized:and it will be seen from the charters, that on thisoccasion at least, the scholars and the people ofthe town, had behaved with great violence and intemperance.This charter consciences with a long recital of the advantageswhich were derived to the public at large, from thatpure fountain of liberal science, of which the universityof Oxford was the head ; and stating the desire of the kingto put an end* to the discords which had arisen betweenthe scholars of the university y and the men of the town;that from the homicides, depredations, and other thingswhich had been done there, it would destroy the AND CITY. 5O7verity, if a rigorous prosecution were had against all : — theking, willing to restore it, and re-establish its peace, —and the chancellor, as well as the mayor and commonaltyof the town, having in consequence of their mutual misconduct,humbly submitted all their goods, jurisdictions,rights, liberties, and privileges to the king, who had takeninto his hands the said discords ; and all the jurisdictions, liberties,and privileges, as well of the university, as of themayor, bailiffs, and men of the town, — ^in the first place prohibitedthem from all mutual acts of aggression. And for thepurpose of recalling the dispersed scholars, the king directedthat they might return, and remain there in security,and be under his protection. — Restoring to the chancellor,masters, and scholars, all the jurisdictions, rights,liberties, and privileges, so taken into the king's hand. — Thatas many great discords, attributed to the avarice of thelay sellers of victuals, had arisen from the chancellor ofthe university, and the mayor of the town, having theassise of bread and beer intrusted to them in common, theking directs that for the future, the chancellor alone shallhave the assise of bread in the town and suburbs, as well asthe assise of weights and measures, rendering an account ofthe forfeitures and profits to the mayor and bailiffs of the town, 'to be levied by them in aid of their firm ; and also cognizanceof all forestallers ; — the forfeitures to be paid to the hospitalof St. John. And although the mayor, bailiffs, aldermen,or other men of the town and suburbs, ought not to intromitin the premises, yet the king directs that they should humblyobey and attend the chancellor ; who is empowered to imprisonthose carrying arms, and to seize them, and expelthose who are refractory, or otherwise proceed against themby ecclesiastical censures, as was accustomed in times past.That for the cleansing, repairing the pavements of the town,and removing all nuisances, the chancellor is empowered tocompel those whose duty it is to do those things to obey himby ecclesiastical censures, against which his prohibition shallnot avail.It was stated, that as the laymen were generally hostile to508 Oxford-UNIVERSITY AND CITY.the scholars and their servants it is granted, that when theministers of the university and the servants of the clerks,are to be assessed or taxed, to any quota to be paid for theirgoods in the town and suburbs, the chancellor, or his vicechancellor, and not the mayor, or men of the tawny shallassess and tax to the quota, the ministers and servants ofthe scholars, to wit, the household servants, &c., faithfullyand reasonably, as the other men of the town and suburbs areassessed, according to the quantity of their taxable goods.And if the men of the town should complain of the taxationhaving been improperly made by the chancellor, it should beinquired into by the king's ministers, and corrected.One feature of this charter, not to be overlooked, is that theliberties were seized into the king's hands, as it is expresslystated, by the consent of the parties.It will be observed also, that the assise of bread andbeer — weights — measures — the inquisition of forestallers —repairing and cleansing of the pavements, which weregranted by it, were within the jurisdiction of the leet andtransferred to the jurisdiction of the vice chancellor.It may be very questionable, as was suggested before,whether the king had power to take away the prohibition, andsubject the parties, altogether without appeal, to the ecclesiasticaljurisdiction. It should be observed, that the mentionof ecclesiastical censures twice in this as well as in subsequentcharters, shows clearly that the jurisdiction of thechancellor was purely ecclesiastical; although the portionof civil jurisdiction before mentioned, was transferred tohim.As to the borough, it seems clear from the repeated useof the word, that " homines" in this charter meant the burgessesof the town ; and that those were the persons whopaid the public quota and taxes.The last clause but one, which restores to the scholars theirgoods, although they had not prosecuted the thieves, standsalso on the same questionable ground, as the clause respectingthe prohibition ; if indeed it had any practical effect. But itshould be observed, that the king grants that clause with theOxford UNIVERSITY AND CITY. 509qualification, ^' as much as in him lies ;" and the scholarsare guarded only from the interference or interruption of theIcing, and his officers.In the next year, the same king confirmed this charter, as ^^56.he states, from the special affection he had for the university,and also for the persons of Humphrey de Carleton, then chancellor,and Lodowick his brother.It appears also that in the same year, a question arosebetween the university and Richard Canary, knight, tenantof the king at fee-farm, of the hundred without the northgate of Oxford, respecting the jurisdiction over the suburb.By an indenture made between them, it seems thatCanary claimed assise of bread and beer of all the tenantsand residents within that hundred, and cognizance ofpleas in his courts there, and the fines; — upon the otherhand, the chancellor, master, and scholars, claim entire andequal jurisdiction in the hundred or suburb as elsewhere inthe town of Oxford, and the other suburbs ; with all the headsof jurisdiction before enumerated in the several charters. —The claims of either party having been heard before theking and council, by the mediation of John, Archbishop ofYork, Chancellor of England, and William, Bishop of Winchester,Treasurer of England, it was agreed by unanimousconsent between the parties, if it should please the hing, —that the chancellor, masters, and scholars should have jurisdictionin the hundred and suburb; — whether any of thesuburb was within the hundred or not — tall disturbers of thepeace and of offenders against the statutes, customs, liberties,and privileges of the university ; where one party is aclerk, or servant of a clerk, or a minister of the university, byimprisonment, banishment, or ecclesiastical censure, — Withcognizance of all causes, contracts, and pleas of moveablegoods, injuries, and transgressions, where a clerk or anyof his family, or a servant clerk, or minister of the universityshould be one of the parties, — pleas of the death of man,and mayhem of free tenement only excepted, — with cognizanceof forestallers, re-grates, and of victuals : the takingof the houses, taxing and paying of the quotas of the610 OXFORD.— UNIVERSITY AND CITY.ministers of the university and servants of the clerks,Tyrant m the hundred or suburb, as well as the keeping ofthe streets clean, the assise of weights and measures, and ofbread and beer. All which liberties, it was agreed between theparties, and granted by the said Richard, with the consentof the king, the university should freely and fully enjoy. Andalthough the said Richard ought not to intromit by himselfor his officers in the premises ; nevertheless, he wishes forhimself and his heirs, that all persons redding in the hundredor suburb, should humbly obey and yield to the chancellor.This agreement between the parties, the king accepted,approved, and confirmed; directing that the chancellor,masters, and scholars should enjoy all those privileges.It is rather surprising, that a question of this descriptionshould arise respecting the boundaries of the several jurisdictions.The chancellor only enjoyed the privileges which hehad procured from the borough, and which were limited toit.The tenant of the hundred, only had jurisdiction overthe hundred ; — and it of course resolved itself into thequestion, whether the suburb was a part of the city or ofthe hundred. In London, the suburbs and liberties are apart of the city : — so also in many other places : and itwould seem that the usage should have put the matter atrest, almost without a question.It is observable, with a view to the subject of our presentinquiry, that the persons who were stated to be under thejurisdiction of the tenant of the hundred, were the tenants andresidents, the usual description of the suitors at the leet : andthe same persons, who within a borough, as well as in thecounty at large, formed the burgesses and the suitors at thesheriffs tom.It must also be remarked, that although the university ishere spoken of as an entire body, under the name of '' universitas,"yet it was not incorporated till the reign of QueenElizabeth ; — ^which affords a strong reason for thinking, thatboroughs not circumstanced as the university, and never sodescribed, could not be corporations.IPSWICH. 611Edward III. by another charter in the 32nd year of his 1358.reign, repeated the former grant of assise of bread a^d beer,weights and measures, and cognizance of forestallers andre-craters, with other privileges and liberties, as given by aformer charter ; which he states also provided, that the clerkof the market should not intromit himself within the boroughor its suburbs to exercise his office, in any thing touchingthem : whereas in fact, nothing of that kind is mentioned inany one of the charters, before stated as granted to theuniversity ; — and it seems clear, that the grant here alludedto, was contained in one of the charters given to the borough.IPSWICH.We have before, in the reign of King John, referred tosome of the documents relative to the peculiar historyof the borough of Ipswich ; and amongst them, to the quali Ipswich.find admission as burgesses, for some special purposes, ofnoblemen and others, who had lands and possessions withinthe borough ; and who had been made burgesses for thepurpose of exempting them from toll; but who paid inreturn for that exemption, scot and lot.The same occurs again in this reign, for in 1273 we find ^^jSS* '•amongst the records of this borough, the following entries :Forasmuch as the A^ir^ oi many foreign burgesses do refuseto contribute and pay to the farm of the town as their ancestorshave been accustomed to do, for having liberty in thetom as their ancestors used to have, by common assent of thetoto, it is ordained and agreed, that no foreign burgess behereafter made in the same town, except for term of his lifeonly ; and this for some certain gift to be made yearly to thefarm of the town at the feast of St. Michael, or that he beatscot and lot, according to his estate, to the commontalliages of the town ; that those who are at lot and scot shallbe quit of toll in the said town, as well of merchandises asof other their goods, and those who are not at scot and lot,shall be quit of com and other their goods, growing and renewingin their own lands, and also of all things brought totheir own use, only in form under written, that is to say : —612 IPSWICH.Edward I. Lord Hugh Tallemacliey granted to give to the farm of thetown o$Ipswichy that he be quit of toll in the town, of hisown granary, Sd. and two bushels of wheat.Lord Guy Wysderlande granted for himself and hisVillainy &c.John de Certaine gives to the commonalty that hemay be a burgess, 4ts. ; and to the bailiff, 2«. : and granted tobe at lot and scot to the farm, as a native burgess, and all thethree appear to be sworn.Lord John de Louth, and Lord Roger de Noonday becametown burgesses, and proffered a cask of wine each ; and thisis given them for the counsel and aid to be had from thanin the business of the town. The first is sworn, but theother does not appear to be so.Three other persons were admitted as burgesses.Robert de St. Question becomes a town burgess, and givesto the commonalty 2s, ; to the bailiffs 2$. ; and hath grantedto be at scot and lot, &c.Master Roger de Holbrooke became a bui^ess, and grantedto give by the year to the said farm for his granary, andvillains, &c.Five paid for their granaries.And the whole mentioned above for this year are stated tobe sworn.Two became burgesses, and grant for their granaries.Three became burgesses, and grant to be at scot andlot.Another is made a burgess, and grants for himself and hisvillains.And they were all sworn.These aise made burgesses, and grant to be at scot and lot.One became a burgess, and granted for his granary.And another granted for his granary and villains — and theywere all sworn.One became a burgess, and paid to the commonalty half amark; and to the bailiffs 2s. — and granted to be at scotand lot.Another made a burgess, proffers to the commonalty aIPSWICH. 513pipe of wine, and granted yearly 4rf. to the farm of the town, ^^"^^-that he might be quit of toll, of com, and all other^hings —and that he be at scot and lot.Another became a burgess upon a present payment. Andanother, who also granted that he would be at scot andlot.Be it remembered, that all the burgesses in this booknamed, were made before the taking of the town into thehinds of King Edward; — that is to say, before the 13thyear of his reign.In the same year — in which also an ancient book, belong ^^^•ing to the corporation, called the Dom Boc, is said to havebeen compiled — the King, by a charter, reciting that for certainoffences and excesses by the burgesses, he had causedthe borough to be seized into his hands, restored it at fee-farmto the burgesses and their heirs.From which it is evident, that Ipswich was not, at thattime, a corporation : — and also, that by the seizure ofthe borough, the prescriptions belonging to it had beendestroyed ; — and, therefore, even if it had been originally acorporation by prescription, it must have ceased to be soupon this seizure and re-grant.The book to which we have alluded, called the Dom Boc, j*^? vis in the Norman French, and commences by reciting, that the som Boc.old Domesday of the laws and ancient usages of the town,had been fraudulently taken away by a false town clerk ;and that, in consequence, bad usages had been introduced.That the commonalty, with one accord and assent, beingdesirous to redress the same, and that the laws and usages ofthe town might be openly set down, for the common profit ofstrangers, as of the townspeople, so that the bailiffs and burgessesof the same town might have a knowledge of it, hadchosen 24 of the most wise and discreet of the town, sworn forthat purpose.They declare, amongst other things — first, that the usage is,that the portman-motes should be pleaded before the bailiffsof the town.VOL.

L LT614 IPSWICH.Edward That pleas of the crown should be pleaded on the same dayIpswich with th^portman-motes.That pleas which were pleaded by gage and pl^ge betweenpersons resident and dwelling in the same town, bepleaded on two days in the week.Pleas between strangers called Pie-wondrous, should bepleaded daily , if the parties were to pray such adjournment ;and that pleas in fair time, between strangers passing throne,should be pleaded hourly.That no woman should be allowed her assign.In writs pf right, the tenant was to be summoned by Horsemenof the town, — that is, liberi homines, not freemen ofa corporation, according to the modem use of that term ;^and the issue, if the summons be denied, was to be tried bythe dozen men — that is, by twelve good and lawful men, tobe chosen by four good and lawful men, who were to be theelinor — ^and who were to be amerced if they did not attend.From this passage, it is clear that the electors must havebeen resident and within the jurisdiction of the court — asotherwise, they could not have been amerced. It is alsodirected, that there should be 24 jurors on the panel.In the provisions which relate to pleas respecting lands,&c., " the terre tenant was to be summoned by two freemen"In pleas of abatement of fresh force, if the disseisor prosecutewithin 40 days the bailiff is directed to seize thetenement, and deliver it to the next two neighbours in ward.This also shows that these provisions relate to the local propertyand habitation of the individuals.Respecting pleas of nuisance of rank-tenement, the plaintiffmust proceed within 40 days — a period frequently occurringin this book ; and the inquest is to be taken by 12 good andlawful men.When a person has committed waste, he should besummoned before the bailiffs by two free and lawful men;and if the party find surety to redress the waste, upon theview and testimony of good men, at a day assigned him byIPSWICH. 616the bailiff and the good men of the court, he should be there Edward Lupon received. • IpswichProvisions are also made respecting the examination ofmarried women upon alienations made by their husbands.And the charter of gift was to be enrolled in full court,before the coroners and good men of the totcn.Tenants for term of life, or for years, were to be summonedby two burgesses of the town ; and if they did not find main-prise,they were to be amerced. It was likewise ordained bythe common assent of the tom, that the forfeitures should belevied for the common profit of the town — and were to bedelivered to credible persons who were to answer to the com-monalty^ and not to the sole profit of the bailiffs of the town.That the burgesses might devise their tenements on theirdeath-beds ; but the will was to be proved within 40 days,before the bailiffs. And that the executors, in default oftheir execution of the will, should be summoned at the placewhere they should reside and dwell in the town; and ifforeigners at the tenement devised.This entry shows clearly that the burgesses possessedtenements within the town; and the distinction is madebetween the executors who reside and dwelt in the town,and those who dwelt out of it; and are therefore calledforeigners. When a person was summoned at the ,and after giving pledge came not, then he wasto be amerced — ^which could only be effected against a personresident within the jurisdiction.If any of the bailiffs were assaulted in the presence ofthe good men of the town, the offender was to be sent toprison according to the award of the good men of the toion^for the offence towards the commonalty.Wardens were to be appointed, to take care that the ordinancesof the town respecting the markets were observed, forthe common profit of the town.That no re^grater, foreigner, or stranger, should go beyondthe bounds of the market, to forestall, &c. And that noforeign merchants, called ^* pedlars*' should purchase before10 o'clock.ll516 IPSWICH.Edward I. Execution for debt was directed to be made, forIpswich residents dwelling, according to the custom of the county-butif at the suit of foreigners, as by merchants of foreigncountries, more speedy distress was to be made fortheir debts or damages, than for such as were residentdwelling within the town, or in the adjacent country, withouthaving regard to the period of forty days for keeping thedistresses.Capias. Chapter 36 recites, that evil-disposed persons had purchasedmerchandise, from the hands of merchants and otherstrangers, and had delayed payment, to the discredit of tk^town, and good people there dwelling. And, that the goodpeople of the tovm, by their unanimous advice and assent, ordained,^' tJiat no town* s person, or any person dawdling in thetown, domestic or stranger, should delay the payment forany goods or merchandise' And if any act otherwise, the*bailiffs might make immediate distress, without readingthe 40 days previous to the distress. And if the purchaserwas a burgess of the town, and should have nothing in thetown whereby the bailiffs could distrain, then such purchasershould be, by the bailiff an good men of the town, forejudgedof his freedom in the town for a year and a day — ^from allmanner of merchandise, which, in the mean time, he wouldhave made, by reason of his freedom as a burgess : andshould not be reconciled to the franchise of the town, untilhe had found good and sufficient surety. And if any personin the towii had been damaged by such wrongful detainer,he and his surety were to answer for, and restore thesame : the surety being enrolled on the common roll of thetown.If a foreigner should be dwelling in the town, anddelay a merchant of his payments, he should be forejudged,by the bailiffs and good men of the town, from making anykind. of merchandise.Capr37. In chapter 37, merchant strangers and their hosts aimentioned — the former being directed to be cautious thatthey employ good and lawful hosts.And if merchants sell without acknowledgment beingIPSWICH. 517made before the bailiff then the merchants should^ave the ^^*^^-best recovery they can. • Ipswich¥1 /» •• '111'/*! Dom Boc.in pleas oi tenements it is provided that if the witnessesbe resident and dwelling in the town, so that the bailiff of thecourt might cause them to come before them, it shall be thentried ; but if the witnesses be foreigners so that the bailiffcannot do so, then the proof should not therefore be delayed,any more than if the witnesses were dead.Every sont a burgess who should be heir to his father,was to come into full court within the first 40 days after thedeath of his father, and be sworn to the franchise ; otherwisehe should be removed from every court in the town, until heshould have so done.The view of frank-pledge, was to be always holden in the• town, in the week of Pentecost ; and the purprestures presentedat the same view, should be redressed and amended,by view of the bailiffs, and of the chief pledges Cpresenters,Jwithin the first 40 tags after the said week of Pentecost.Here we have distinct proof that the jurors, or presenters,were the chief pledges.Burgesses' widows whether the burgess be a peer or commoner,should have the capital messuage of her husband infree bench, or a moiety of his lands in the town.If a burgess, denizen in the town, marry a foreign woman,and she survive her husband, the woman should enjoy the franchiseof the town, so long as she should continue a widow.That no terre tenant in the town should do homage to thechief lord, for any tenements which he holds in the town,especially for that which is holden purely in free burgage.That no foreigner should distrain his tenant in the town,without the bailiff — because the bailiff ought not to allowthat a distress be anywhere put, except in a place withinthe town ; where the bailiff can in due form make deliverance,by gage and pledge j if necessary ^ according to law and reason.But it is lawful for such burgesses, denizens of the town, payingscot and lot, to distrain their tenants in the town, forrent in arrear, at any time, without a bailiff; because if theyput their distresses elsewhere than they ought to do, they518 IPSWICH.Edward I. are moveable to be distrained and more amenable to theipswich bailiffs of the town then foreigners.And it was ordained by the common council of the eaton, thatno person, unless he be a burgess, denizen of the town, anda peer and commoner, should be the host of merchantstrangers.By the unanimous consent and assent of the tawny itwas provided, that no burgess of the town, domestic orstranger, should be impleaded without the borough. Ifany one plead thereto, he should be admonished by thebailiffs and two burgesses of the town. That every burgessshould sue in the town for his right. And if after such admonition,he sue forth his plea, he should be summoned by asworn bailiff, and two burgesses (before, it was two freemen),attheportman-mote; and, if forejudged hythehtiliff and goodmenof the town, he should be in full court forejudged of hisfreedom in the tom, and be adjudged a foreigner (here themeaning of foreigner is unquestionable) ; — she shall not berestored to his freedom, unless it be by making a fresh fineto the commonalty y for having his freedom again.It was ordained by all the commonalty that no foreignmerchant should be admitted a burgess, if he inherit not atenement in the same tom, where he may be made amenableto justice, and distrainable at the suit of the commonalty.If any one, after he should be admitted a burgess, alienhis tenements in the town, and convey away his chattelsout. of the town, and will not remain at scot and lot, nor aidingto the town, as a burgess ought to be, his freedom should berevoked by the bailiffs, coroners, and good men of the town.And if he, or any in his behalf, should be discovered tradingin the town, after he should have so forbore to contributeaid to the town, his customs should be taken as from aforeigner. But it must not be understood by this constitution,that it was forbidden to admit as burgesses, knights andcountry gentlemen, who might be partial to reside in the town;yet to such persons, the freedom * of the town should begranted only for the term of their lives.It was also agreed by all the commonalty, that if anyIPSWICH. 519bui^ess of the town should discover the secrets o^he town Edward I.whereby the franchises might be infringed, such burgess Ipswichshould be summoned to appear before the bailiffs, coroners,and commonalty, to answer concerning the same ; and ifconvicted, should be forejudged of his freedom.By the common assent of the town, there should always bein the town, 12 of the most wise and loyal, sworn to governand maintain the laws and rightful usages of the town, andon behalf of the commonalty, to ordain what shall be for thecommon benefit. And because the *^ twelve jurats*' wouldbe employed for the state and honour of the town, thereforethe commonalty granted to the jurats, the common meadowcalled Odenholm.Different payments for wines were made by burgesses —burgesses' denizens, at scot and lot — foreign burgesses, notat scot and lot (as a peer and commoner) — and foreigners.Twelve porters or bergen — that is, the men of the port orborough — are mentioned.The four great divisions of the town, are described by the ^^^eete*"^four sets or cards — the east gate leet, or ward : the westgate leet, or ward : the south gate leet, or ward : the northgate leet, or ward. The boundaries of each of them aredistinctly described, and the nature of wards and courts leetfully explained.In London, every ward had its ward-mote; which LordCoke states, was the same as the leet; all the functions ofthe ward-mote, being the same as those of that court. Andat Ipswich, we find they were so called ; and the town dividedaccording to their jurisdictions.As illustrative of the use of the term " men*' in ancient "^'^Q-documents, after the extensive extracts we have made fromthe Dom Boc of Ipswich, it may be worth while to mention,that in this same year, the men and burgesses of Ipswich hada charge made upon them : from which it is impossible notto infer, that those terms were respectively descriptive ofthe inhabitants: the former, of those who had not beensworn as burgesses; the latter of those who had beenso sworn, and therefore were called burgesses — an explanation520 IPSWICH.Edward I. necessary to be bore in mind throughout the progress of thbinquiry.We find also in the books of Ipswich, a list of the names ofForeign foreign burgesses who were only made for the terms of theirlives; and, as it is stated , principally after' King Edward redeliveredthe town to the burgesses at fee-farm.They were those who had not originally lived within thetown, but who (as stated in the extract we have beforecited) "were partial to reside there. They were made for theterm of their lives only, which if taken literally, would appeara singular provision ; but it in truth meant, that they werenot received as burgesses generally, or entire burgesses, butonly for the purpose of exempting them from the dues andcustoms of the town, for their own lives ; and therefore theirchildren would derive no advantage of burgess-ship from them.In consideration of such exemption they were to payscot and lot, and the usual fines upon their admission. Manywere made in that form. Others were made upon the paymentof a yearly sum for themselves and their villains: — andthey were all sworn. Others were, on payments made,admitted to the guild ; and amongst them a female ; butthese do not appear to have been sworn. They were, therefore,in all probability, only admitted as members of theguild, and took no oath ; for a woman could not be a burgess,nor be sworn to her law, as we have seen before fromBracton and Britton. Another person appears to have beenmade a burgess and a guild brother, marking the distinctionbetween the two. Some were merely allowed to be free ottoll, upon yearly and other pecuniary payments. This waslittle more than a composition for the toll, and probablyexplains the payment for the granaries.Comments In these extracts from the records of Ipswich, we have a fulldescription of the usages and customs of this ancient town,at the early period upon which we are commenting ; and thereader cannot fail to observe, that we have here a perfect specimenof the use and application of the Saxon laws down tothis period. We find the leading distinctions between freemenand villains clearly recognized — also the local juris-ipswich.521diction of the borough, as distinct from the county, clearly ^^^"^ ^'marked by the limits and divisions of the bor<ftgh, andnot extending beyond them — we find the principal policeand government of the tov^n transacted at the leets — thefull burgesses distinguished from the other people by theirbelonging to the place, 2la contradistinguished (rom foreignersor strangers, as being sworn, and possessing tenementswithin the borough and the jurisdiction of its courts, bywhich they could be summoned and distrained. We alsofind that those who part with their tenements, and are nolonger householders, cease to be burgesses, and are treatedas foreigners or strangers. It is likewise expressly stated,that the juries (the 24, the 12, and the dozen men) weresometimes called the chief pledges — sometimes the jurats —and presenters; and that they had entrusted to them thepresenting of all grievances and nuisances in the place, aswell as the general care and superintendence of the town.We also perceive distinctly the traces of the gage andpledges : — the incapacity, according to the law of the leet,of women to be burgesses, though they might enjoy someof the privileges : — and . finally the absolute necessity ofresidence to constitute a full burgess ; — so perfectly correspondingwith the general law of the court leet, where resiancywas the requisite qualification of a suitor.The common roll of the town is also mentioned: — and thesystem of responsibility of the hosts according to the Saxon jlaws. Nor must we forget, that although no right of 'burgess-ship in respect of burgage tenure has ever prevailedin Ipswich, yet it is evident that the whole town was held byburgage tenure. Every thing connected with burgess-shipseems to depend upon the payment of scot and lot, andthe being sworn to the town. All the funds, fines, amercementsand forfeitures, are repeatedly declared to be for thecommon profit of the town ; every thing was to be done bythe common assent of the town and the commonalty : — underthe names of " the good and lawful men" — who being thesuborn men (for otherwise they were not lawful), were theburgesses.The freemen also — required by the law to be swon^622 IPSWICH.Edward I. were therefore burgesses, and attended at all the courts ;every thftg being transacted by and before them in thegeneral assembly of the people called ihepcrtnuin-fM^te, or themeeting of the men of the town : — which latter expressiondoes not apply, as we have had occasion to observe before,to every man who lived in the town — for some might beforeigners — religious persons — the villains of other lords —women — minors &c. ; — but to the free inhabitants — stew Lens —paying scot and bearing lot — sworn and enrolled — and suchmen were the real, fill burgesses of Ipswich.Nor should we close these comments without againobserving, that the burgesses were separate and distinctfrom the brethren of the guild. And it must be remembered,that throughout these minute and detailed extractsrelative to Ipswich, in which the commonalty are frequentlyspoken of, there is no trace whatever of a corporation.Our extracts from the documents of the city and universityof Oxford, and Ipswich, have occupied so large a space,that we must be content briefly to pass over many of thelocal documents of this reign ; though some few will requireparticular observation.Warebam. A view of frank-pledge, with infangthef, gallows, pillory,assise of bread and beer, at Wareham, were certified asbelonging to Gilbert de Clare.■^*.«*^V**^*^- The same claim was made by the Abbot of Tamstock.^1281. -^1282.

In the Same year, the bailiff of the city of Hereford wascommitted to the Fleet, for a sum due from the citizens ofHereford.iso ^* In this year, Combe was in the hands of the crown ; andrac.

After which follows this clause — " So that no one*^ who is not of that guild, shall make any merchandise inthe borough, unless with the consent of the burgesses ;'*a provision perfectly reasonable, inasmuch as it would be tothe injury of the burgesses, that foreigners coming to thetown, should make advantage of their merchandise there,without the consent of the burgesses, who had to pay andbear the common burdens of the town.The burgesses were to elect from themselves annually, amayor. And the usual privileges are added — that theywere not to plead without the borough, — ^that they were tohave return of writs ; — that neither the sheriffs nor the king'sbailiffs nor ministers should interfere there ; — ^with the usualfreedom from toll, passage, &c. The provision in Glanville,as to residence for a year and a day, without claim, is alsoincluded, with some other more specific provisions on thathead ; — as that they should dwell and hold land there —should be in the guild, — be in lot and scot with the sameburgesses — should not be claimed by their lords ; — shouldnot make trial by battle, but should puisse themselves by theoaths of 20 lawful men.And finally that all of the borough, willing to enjoy the• 1 Pet MS. 71.524 NEWCASTLE.UP0N-TYNE.-DUNW1CH.Edward, liberties sid customs of it, should be at geld and scot withj the burgesses, as often as it should happen that they might^ be tallied.^*unon?*' '^^^ "S*^* ^f ^^^ burgesses of Newcastle to bequeath their1^5? tenements, is twice recognized ; and that they should notplead without the town.1293. In this year, there was a quo warranto against the .bailiffsand community of this place (there being at this time noappearance of a corporation), to show by what claim theyhad the return of writs, to hold pleas and have a guild Imerchant. And that they should not be impleaded withoutthe town, with the other usual privileges.Afterwards, the liberties were ordered to be taken into theking's hands : — and it appears they were for some time inthe custody of a person appointed by the king : — ^who in1294. the next year of his reign,* granted a confirmation of thecharter of the 36th of Henry III., and the liberty ofchoosing coroners, who were to be sworn in full court.1299. '"^^ lands of Pampedun were united to Newcastle for theincrease of the tovm ; and were to be held in free burgage inthe same manner as those of Newcastle ;t with all customsand liberties there, as elsewhere in the town, and at the samefee-farm ; and to constitute thenceforth, one town or borough.But notwithstanding this express mention of burgagetenure, there is no trace of any such right of burgess-ship in-^, the borough.Dunwich.

And in the succeeding year,the keeper and ministers of the market of Lincoln, weredeclared exempt from talliages and watchings with the othercitizensThat the same exemption accompanied the exclusive Chichester.. 1278.privileges of the ecclesiastics, may be inferred from this fact,amongst a variety of others, that the Bishop of Chichester, inthis year, had a grant, that all his men should be free fromsuits of shires and hundreds ; and that he should have viewof frank-pledge, infangthef, &c.The county palatine of Chester, was in this year vested *272.in the crown. And in the 6th of Edward I., the commons ^^78.complain that they are impleaded out of their county, againsttheir usages and free customs, which they have been accustomedto hold under King Henry, the father of their present J, ^king ; and under Rondulph^lbrmerly Earl of Chester. J ^It is impossible that the commons of Chester, claiming theright of being impleaded within their own jurisdiction, couldbe any others than the whole free inhabitants, duly sworn,and therefore the hateful men of the county ; for a partial exclusivejurisdiction, applicable to some of the lawful inhabitants,and not to the others, would have been an impracticableprovision ; — and we shall see by other documents, that thisprivilege of being impleaded in their own courts, and withintheir own limits was granted to the burgesses ; therefore it isclear that the commons and burgesses were the same class, andwere such inhabitants." Indeed these, and many otherprivileges granted by the early charters, would be unreal.B. Rot. 36. 3 Dyer 279. B note.t Mem. Scac. Hil. T. 2 Edward I. fol. 2 et fol. 3. % Pet.

In this reign, we have also another distinct instance of thefull extent of the jurisdiction of the sheriff's tom. The menof the Abbey of St. Augustin, of Canterbury, in the hundredof Kingston, complain that \\xe hundred yr^A ancient demesne,and was not accustomed to be called in judgment ; but thatDpoenna- ^hc sheriff of Kent had distrained all the decennaries of thebarony of the abbey in the hundred, to come before him in thecounty to answer, wherefore they do not present all the* defaultsof the tenants of 12 years , &c. : — which is against thecustom of the hundred. Particularly as the greater part ofthe men of the hundred are sailors, serving the barons of theCinque Ports on the sea.^^^* It appears that Evesham like many other places in whichBurgage, the Corporate right of election now prevails, had anciently itsburgage — for Tindal mentions a charter in the reign of EdwardI., granting lands and burgages in Evesham, thus : —Carta Edw. R. de terr. et burgagiis. Joh. de Twye4nEvesham.*1295. It is said that Evesham returned members to Parliament inthis year, — willis expressly affirms it, — and Tindal in theappendix of his History of Evesham, gives the names ofRichard de Denton, and Robert Was, as the members returned.But, as no trace is now to be found of any record ofthe return ; and as Evesham was then a purely ecclesiasticalestablishment, and exempt from all secular service ; the factis very doubtful, not to say improbable.Truro. Another instance relative to burgages, occurs in this reignwith respect to Truro ; the former privileges of which wereconfirmed in this year. In a document of the 26th of• Tindal. 174.Burgage.— Ludlow-NORWICH. 527Edward I., a person is described as holding tenements in^^^^dl.Truro in free burgage ; but there is no trace whatever of any 121M.burgage tenure right in this borough — ^nor are there any generalbody of burgesses but the inhabitants; who are expresslyincorporated by the charter of Elizabeth. ^^.-So also there is in this year, a grant of a burgage in Ludlow Ludlow.with the liberty of the town, by one Samson of Ludlow, cordwainer,to Reginald of Ludlow, butcher, — ^which describesthe subject of the grant '' as a certain burgage of land, with'^ all the houses and buildings thereupon erected, with the'' curtilage, and all its appurtenances, and with the liberty of** the tovm; — which said burgage is in Rochford, between« the land of, &c."But there is likewise no trace of bui^ge tenure in Ludlow:the burgesses being the freemen of the corporation.This document most clearly shows that the burgage, which x"n^^was no doubt a house, gave to the occupier of it, the libertyof the town : which is the only mode, as we have observedbefore, by which the common law, and the doctrine of burgagetenure can be reconciled to the facts now found to exist.Burgage tenure was the universal tenure by which all boroughswere held : and all persons who occupied any house inaborough, were on that ground, paying also scot and ht^ andbeing swomj the burgesses of that borough — in conformitywith4he effect of the decision of the House of Commons inthe reign of James L, — " that of common rights all the ina*** bitant householders were the burgesses*The liberties of Norwich were seized into the king's hands ^ySji^**'for the non-payment of the fee-farm.The king granted that the assises for the county of Nor ^289.folk, should be held in his house, which is called the shire-house,in the fee of the castle there.Two places were determined to be out of the city, and in 1302.the king's hundred of Bromfield. — Showing that all whichwas not within the city, was in the hundreds of the county,and under the jurisdiction of the sheriiT.The citizens petition the king in Parliament, to have a **^-528 EX ETER.-BEVERLEY-successors.Edward I. grant of the leet, and view of frankpledge of Great Newgate,which 1^ had recovered against the prior.

The dean and chapter of St. Peter's, York, confirm to theburgesses of Beverley and their heirs, the privileges grantedby the Archbishops of York. — sand King Edward, in the1306 36th of his reign, confirms the charters of the 21st and sethof Henry III. to the burgesses of Beverley, their heirs andsuccessors, burgesses of the town.Heir. We have seen in all the charters of the preceding reigns,and in the commencement of this, that the grants were tothe burgesses and their heirs, importing nothing but thenatural succession by inheritance. But in the reign ofHenry III., Bracton had compiled his work, in which hespeaks of the '' universitas " of the civil law, and the doctrinesconnected with it. That law had long been adoptedin England, as applicable to ecclesiastical bodies ; and weSucceaton have before noticed the use of the term " successors*' as appliedto them. The doctrine of succession had, subsequentlyto the compilation of Bracton, probably become more generallyknown. — And therefore we find, shortly after the commencementof this reign, at least in the 12th year of it, inthis instance of Beverley, the term " successors " added tothat of heirs, as applied to burgesses ; undoubtedly someslight recognition of the doctrine of aggregate succession,PI.

In the same year, the king wills — ^that all lands belongingto the Cinque Ports should be as free and enfranchised astheir other lands And that those which were beforegildahUyX should remain in the same state ; and do the sameservices that the body freely did with their other lands, whichwere of the franchise of the port.These therefore must have been lands without the CinquePorts, in the county at large, but held by the barons whoresided within them — as clearly explained by the followingdocuments.The barons claimed, that they should not be put uponassises, juries, or recognizances, by reason of fardgn tertregainst their wills This privilege was granted to them bythe charter of the 18th of Edward L, — ^and was demandedbefore J. de Berewyk and his fellow-justices, itinerant in thecounty of Kent. The king in council thus interpreted thecharter — "That the barons, by reason of way foreign tenure,which they held at the day of the making the charter, aslong as their service was required at the ports — and theyshould do it there — should not be placed in assises, juries,*^ or recognizances. But for their foreign lands afterwardsacquired, and to be acquired, they should perform the^* customs and services as they had been used and accus** toned — ^and as other tenants of the same lands and tenements,for their lands were accustomed to do.But, although as long as they were remaining and residentwithin the ports, and yielded the services of the port, theyshould be released, and not placed upon assises, juries, orrecognizances, against their will: — yet, if they shouldremove themselves to foreign tenements, and remain in thesame, without the port, and not yield the service of the port,then they should be placed upon assises, juries, and recog-• Rot.

It appearsclearly, by all the ancient documents — from Domesdaydownwards — that citizens and burgesses, reading in theircities and boroughs, had lands out of their limits, in respectof which they owed service to the particular lords underwhom they held. Of course, considerable difficulties aroseas to the conflicting services to be rendered at the differentplaces of their residence and tenure. Nor was it easy to ^reconcile them. Pecuniary services might be borne whereverthe lands or goods were liable to be assessed ; but personalservice could only be performed at one place. Suit royal —or the service to the king at the court leet — was expresslyprovided for by the statute of Marlberge,t to be done only atoneplace ; — and that, where the party was principally com-moran. The other services also due to the king and thelaw — and amongst them that of serving on juries — shouldalso, by analogous reasoning, be confined to the place inwhich the party was resident : — provided he really did theservice there ; that being the reasonable ground of his exemptionfrom those duties elsewhere.And according to those principles the matter was resolvedby the king and council on this occasion.But — with reference to this service, as well as manyothers — a difficulty often arose, as to lands newly purchased.Under the privileged grants of the crown, the inconvenienceSee partieiriwl7 the pert of Domesday which relates to Wiltshire. t Cap 10.mm532 CINQUE PORTS.E«iwardl.| and incongruity of the new owners of those lands beingt exempt from the services to which the former owners wereliable, necessarily arose. That difficulty is, in this instance,j removed by the decision of the council ; which provides, thatI the privilege under the charter, should apply generally to alllands held by the barons before and at the granting of thecharter; and should not apply to subsequently purchased/ lands, unless the baron continued to reside and do the services,' within the ports. If he removed from thence, he lost his localI privileges and exemptions, and became liable to personall public functions in the county at large — and therefore wassubject, amongst other things, to serve on juries in assises.\ Thus the whole of the privileges and liabilities in both cases,depended upon the fact of residence within the limits of theplace : a doctrine which all the former documents have illustratedand confirmed,cuttumaifl.'' The several Custumah of the Cinque Points now in existenceall of them undoubtedly of great antiquity — afford us aclear insight (if examined impartially, and with a view to thegeneral law of the land, and the history of other contemporaneousmunicipal bodies,) into the real nature, character,and object of their institution : — and also supply an opportunityof comparison with other boroughs. For there canbe no doubt — as will be most apparent from the generalimport of these custumals, §% embodying the chief topics ofthe Saxon and early common law— that these Cinque Ports,although called by the peculiar name, by which they wereunited to each other for some purposes — ^yet were they, inother respects, precisely similar and analogous to the otherboroughs in the kingdom.Sandwich, Qf these custumals. Sandwich appears to be the oldest,and to be properly attributed to this reign. It is said to be1301. of the date of the 29th of Edward I.Romney. That of Romney was, in the quo warranto against JohnGibbon, in 1734,* referred to the reign of Henry VII.^^^ ® " And that of Winchehea^ to the reign of Philip and Mary —but from their contents, it is clear they were all of the same• 17 Howell's St. Tri. 814,CINQUE PORTS. 533original antiquity, although some of the copies of them,^^^^*might have had a later date affixed to them. 'They are Cu»tunui?.generally speaking, in substance the same, varying onlyoccasionally in expression — and some being, in a few instances,more minute and particular than the others. Wherethey differ, they afford instances of the inconveniences resultingfrom the adoption of various usages in different places, Variousnotwithstanding their respective charters are in effect the"**^®*'same. Thus, in the Cinque Ports, whose constitutions nodoubt were originally uniform, and in the reign of Charles II.one general charter was granted for the whole; — yet, byusurpations and abuses, from time to time introduced, theirusages have eventually become different in almost each ofthe ports.The custumals of Deer and Rye have no dates. That of Rye.Hastings appears to have been lost in the last century, after Hastings.its production in a court of law, upon the trial of a mandamus,in the year 1736, at the suit of Mr. Henry Moore.*Only a few extracts of the Hythe custumal are preserved, Hyihe.and the rest are altogether lost or destroyed.In the reign of Edward III., the constable of the castleof Dover, ordered each of the mayors of the Cinque Ports,and their two ancient towns, to deliver into his castle atDover, copies of all their ancient custumals, which they hadenjoyed from their first enfranchisement — that in case of anyappeal to him from erroneous judgment in any of the mayor'scourts, he, as the judge of his court at Shepway, might havea guide to regulate his decisions.Consequently little doubt can arise, but that there existedin that reign, copies of all the custumals, in the possession ofthe constable of the castle of Dover.Amongst the records of the corporation of Sandwich, of « ^j^^lthis date, is a MS. in Latin, usually called the ctsstumal ofSandwiches It was originally drawn up by one AdamChimneys, and the MS. at present among the records ofSee 17 Powers St. Tri. 849; Strange 's Hep. 1070; and Seaford Case,Lambert.t See also Hargrave Law Tracts, p. 118.634 CINQUE PORTS.Edward T. tee Corporation, appears to be a transcript of the originalCustumais. documcnt^and made in the beginning of the reign of EdwardIV. Some passages in it are of modem date, being enteredby different town clerks since that time. It does not appearwho Adam Chimneys was. The original is lost ; and manyof the customs are said to be obsolete — ^how they became soisnot stated — and others prevail at this time.Sandwich. The following are extracts from the custumais of Sandwich,and the other Cinque Ports :Mayor. First, — as to the manner of choosing the mayor, the Serjeantsounds the common horn, and proclaims that everyman of 12 years f or more, is to haste to the St. Clement'schurch, to the common assembly. When the mayor of thepreceding year, the jurats and the commonalty being assem-^bled, the mayor desires the commonalty to proceed iso theelections. The mayor withdraws, and nominates three reputablemen, to be put in election, who must all be natives, forno strangers are eligible to the office of mayor. The commonaltyelect one of the three.Dover. j^^ custumal of Dover is to the same effect, as to callingthe assembly ; but silent as to the rest : — except, that theConiTi»o- election is to be by the commonalty; called also, both in thiscustumal and in that of Winchelsea, the portmen.^y«- That o{Rye, is like the Dover.Winchelsea fjjg^^ ^f Winchelsca, directs the election to be made by theInhabitants inhabitants in the hundred by common consent.Romney. In that of Romney, the persons to be summoned are thefolk of the town ;" who in the Rye and Winchelsea cussare called the " indwellers."It is clear, that these are all in substance the same : —that the election ought to be at the hundred court, or commonassembly ; which from other documents, will hereafter beshown to be the court leet of the borough ; and the personswho were to attend there, were the inhabitants ; being everyman, (i. e. every freeman,) above the age of 12 years : — theproper suitors, by the common law, at the court leet : — ^andthe election is to be by the common assent of them all. Itappears, that the persons who were eligible as mayors, were4tCINQUE PORTS. 536the natives, or persons born in the town — as contradicting Edw"d I.gushed from strangers, custumais.The mayor was to take the oath of office, which includesthe oath of alliance.It is also clear, that the court so held was the court leet : —as thejtfra^^ are spoken of, who appear to have been the juryofficiating at that court ; and who in Dover, are called thesutatores, suitors, or j rats. In the Romney custumal, they aredescribed as '' the 12 sworn men, who are to keep and govern*' the town ;" and in one place, the juries. In that of Rye,they are described '^ as the most prudent men of the commonalty."And in the custumal of Winchelsea, " the 12sworn men — the most wise in the town — ^who are to besworn to the king, and the commons ;" and in another part,the jurors." It must be remembered, that the jury at thecourt leet are the king's jury, and are sworn to the king.In another provision of all the custumals, it is declared,that if any one refused to serve the office of mayor or jurat,the commonalty might pull down his chief tenement, and turnhis wife and family out of the town; and the resiant wasaltogether disfranchised. This may appear to have been asevere punishment : — but it was in strict conformity with theseverity of the ancient common law, applied to the omissionof any public duties. For as we have seen previously, fromthe earliest periods of our institutions, every man, who didnot obey and submit to the law, and its duties, was consideredan outlaw, and was — 'eut caput lupin;" and in thecustumals, the mode of '' leading out an infamous person to'' the furthest part of the franchise ; " and that he shouldthere forswear the town and the franchise, is pointed out.Another provision directs,* that after the bailiff, appointed *>^^>*^i'*°t*by the king, is charged, the freemen are desired to assist himin every thing. This was a duty which arose out of the lawof the court leet: — the freemen, therefore, here spoken of, arethe ^'resiantSy" — or "inhabitants," as described in the cussof Winchelsea — or " portmen ; " — all of which appearby the custumal to be synonymous terms, and contradistinguishedfrom strangers.• No. 8.536 CINQUE PORTS.Ed ward I. The hundreds are constantly spoken of in these custamak,ciwturaaia. and the " men of lawful condition," twelve of whom wereto he compurgators of the accused. And it may be generallyaffirmed, that those ancient documents, are with respectto flight — the 40 days — the year and a day — the holdingcourts from eight days to eight days — as to bloodshed andhamsoken — pledges — misprision of theft — and the law as tohosts — in strict analogy with the ancient Saxon commonlaw — ^and the treatises of Bracton, Britton, and Fleta. AnBuigt!:ie»es. observation which may be applied to the ancient bye-lawsof all boroughs ; which seem to have been originally littlemore than repetitions of parts of the common law, for theimmediate use of those living in the borough.It appears also from these custumals, that if the mayorsmisconducted themselves, by giving false judgments or otherwise,the franchises of the town or port were to be seizedinto the hands of the king, in the same manner as all otherboroughs.Six persons of the most sufficient of each of the CinquePorts are required to attend at their great court at Shepway.The free tenements of the freemen are mentioned in thecustumal of Sandwich, as well as the houses of the partieswho aise to be summoned to the hundred. It speaks alsoof the view of frank-pledge, — and expressly states, thatevery man of twelve years was to attend at the hundred.The mayor and jurats have, as another part of the dutyat the court leet, the examination of weights and measures.We have before observed, that passages have been addedto these custumals by the town-clerks at different periods.In the 43rd section of the Sandwich custumal, there is astriking instance of this — ^^ the men or women of the corporationsare spoken of: — ^that word, in fact, not being in useat the period in which the original custumal was compiled.Freemen. We come now to the important clause as to the admissionof freemen.Dover. No provision on that head occurs in the custumal of Dover;and, therefore, we must assume that no special regulationwas made with respect to it : — the freemen, no doubt, beingadmitted in the usual course at the court leet.CINQUE Ports-FREEMEN. 537Neither will the regulations as to the admission of freemen Edward Lm Sandwich be found to contain any thing peculiar, beyond Castumais.the general direction contained in Glanville — the RegiammMajestatem — and in many of the charters granted toboroughs — as well Welsh — English — and Irish:— exceptingthat at Sandwich (for the passage as to trade is omitted inthe Romney custumal) the urge appears to have connectedthe admission more directly with trade than at other places.This may perhaps be accounted for by the circumstance thatthe strangers who came into the town, were desirous ofbeing enrolled amongst the inhabitants, as they thereby obtainedan advantage in their trade, by becoming exempt fromthose extra charges, to which strangers were liable; andwere also at liberty to trade freely.The whole right to claim admission, it would seem, is Resident.founded, according to the common law, upon residence forayear and a day ; and possessing a place or tenement bywhich he could be distrained. The party is, according to thelaw of the court leet, to take the oath of allegiance ; and tofind his pledges; which, throughout the custumal of Romney,are called his hiiiiitghi.^^^^^^ ''He is also, in conformity with the laws of William the Scot andConqueror, to pay scot and lot.Upon the principle we have before explained, he is to pay Fine,a fine or composition to the mayor and commonalty, beinghis contribution to the common stock. And the whole is tobe done with the consent of the commonalty — because,otherwise, they might have imposed upon them a villain,for taking whom, they might be responsible to his lord ; —or a suspected or infamous person, for whose past or futureconduct they might be liable. But, subject to those objections,sounded upon fact, the party was both entitled andbound to be sworn and enrolled, afler a y ear 's* residence inthe place.It is subsequently added in the custumal, that a stranger Strangers,might obtain his freedom in three different ways: — by payinga sum of money as above — ^by marriage with a free woman,which, it will be remembered, is a mode of acquiring freesCINQUE Ports-FREEMEN.^^"^^' dom, founded upon the common law — and by the purchaseCttstuBMia. of a free tenement, which is also a ground of fineedonResidence, having the same origin : — but it is afterwards stated, that itis a general precedent qualification, applicable to all thesemodes of obtaining admission, that the party has residedaccording to the common law, for a year and a day.It must also be remembered, that it is equally an absolutecondition precedent, that a person should not be a villain; — ^which, with reference to the law so frequently quotedbefore, makes the residence of a year and a day, indispensablynecessary before the stranger can be admitted.And, upon the same principle, it is added, that such tenementsare only free, as owe neither suit nor rent to any one ;for, if the house in the borough was held of any lord ; andbelonged to another manor, the tenant might be the villainof the lord, and reside there as such ; and not as free. Andthen undoubtedly could not, under the law reis stated inGlanville and elsewhere, be admitted as a freeman.The section for making freemen is as follows : —Freemen. " The mayor and jurats may make freemen in this manner :•*^ when a stranger comes to the town, and carries on thereany useful trade, with decency and reputation, for the spaceof a year and a day and is then desirous of becoming afreeman of the corparaHonff he should come before themayor and jurats at a common assembly, on a day apepointed, and with the consent of the commonalty, should** be sworn to be good and true, from that day during his** life, to our Lord the King of England, and his heirs, and'' to assist and maintain the state of the liberty of the town to'' his power, &c.

And he states afterwards, 'that any resident** within the franchise, who was of abilities to pay scot and'' lot J and to do watch and ward, would appear by the recordsof the court, to be admitted into the privileges."Notwithstanding it is the clear result of all these cestusthat their constitutions were in fact the same ; and thatthey were rather the laws and usages of the Cinque Portsgenerally, than of any particular place ; and notwithstanding,as before observed, Queen Elizabeth granted, and Charles II.confirmed, one general charter to all the Cinque Ports : — ^yet,we find that in after times, their laws and usages mostessentially differed ; or at least, various classes of personshave been determined to be the burgesses or barons in thedifferent ports.Thus, although the persons entitled to the privileges ofDover, are described in Domesday to be continually resident^ there, '' assidu^ manette ; " — ^and in Glanville, the freemenwere required to be inhabitants ;'f — and in the reign of QueenElizabeth, and at sundry periods, it. appears by several regulationsas to the freeholders, that those only who hadfree tenements of the value of 40*., were to enjoy the freedom; — yet Jreefnen, elected and admitted by the corporationswhether resident or not, are the persons who have been declaredby the House of Commons to be the burgesses or baronsof several of the Cinque Ports ; and they are now so treatedand considered.Page 221. t See Gland. 14.MANCHESTER ORDINANCES. 541• On the other hand, in Sandwich, not only have such free ^^"<^^'Then been permitted to act as the barons, and burgesses, butfreeholders also, whether resident or not have been consideredentitled to enjoy the privileges.At Rye, the resident freemen, reduced to a very small number,are the barons; — at Romney, the mayor, jurats, andcommonalty ; — at Hythe, the mayor, jurats, common council,and freemen, including a great number of non-residents;and at Winchelsea, the mayor, jurats, and freemen beinginhabitants. In some of the Cinque Ports, the freedomYkBs been sold for different sums. Yet Lord Coke says,* andno doubt with truth, as appears from the custumals quotedabove, and the Cinque Port charters, ** that the privileges of** all the Cinque Ports are the same."MANCHESTER.That these customs which are stated by Lord Coke to bethesame in all the Cinque Ports, were in truth, the same asthose sanctioned by the Saxon and early common law ; andthat the other boroughs of England had also, custumals^ orrecords of their usages, founded on the common law, may becollected from an instance which occurs of a document in the26th year of this same reign, relative to the borough of Man' Man<|h«-chester which purports to be a recognition of the customs of ^^1«that borough, by the lord of it, who confirmed them to theburgesses: and they appear to have been subsequently enrolled,and exemplified in the 21st James L 1623. As thedocument is of such antiquity, and curious, we shall transcribesome extracts from it.It states, that the burgesses should pay for every burgage,12d. by the year, for all service.It will be remembered that such a payment, and for such apurpose, was frequently mentioned in Domesday; and wehave before observed, that every borough had burgages ; towhich also the books of the brotherhood of several of theCinque Ports, frequently allude.In the Manchester document, the burgesses, and propositus• 4 Inst. 222.542 MANCHESTER ORDINANCES.Edward I. yiUee, are mentioned as well as the laghmot. And it is directedthat if the reeve should summon a burgess, and he donot come to the laghmot, he should forfeit 12d. to the lord,who should have his action upon him, in the part-mote.If any burgess sue\another burgess for a debt, and beacknowledge it, then shall the burgh reeve assign him a day(to with) the eighth : — and if he come not at the day, he shallpay to the lord I2d.f and he shall pay the debt, and to thebuighreeve, 8d. This is in effect, precisely the same as oneof the customs of the Cinque Ports.If any man make claim of any thing, and shall notfind bail, or plbdobs, and afterwards would leave his claim,he shall be without forfeiture. The pledges so frequentlyreferred to in the common law, and also in the Cinque Portcustumals, are here introduced.If any burgess in the borough, on the Sunday, or from nineo'clock on Sunday, until Monday, do wound any largess,he shall forfeit 20s.

In the same year, upon a writ of adquod damnum certain lands in the city were granted to themayor and commonalty, towards the repair of the bridge.It appears from the Parliament rolls of this date,l| that the '289.citizens of London prayed the king to place them in theiroriginal state ; to grant to them a mayoTy and their ancientliberties. They also prayed against alien merchants whocarried off their gains, and bore none of the burdens, and 1376.who were in the habit of remaining in the dty beyond AO days.Which was contrary to the Saxon law, and those of HenryI. and 11.^ and it was answered, — the king was informed thatthe foreign merchants were fit and useful men, and was counsellednot to expel them.Here we again find the citizens of London, as the generalbody, petitioning for privileges : — and the inference arisingfrom these documents, agrees with that which all the chartersand other records relative to London establish — that thecitizens were the general body of the inhabitants.The distinction here drawn between the citizens and the Aliens.alien merchants, tends to confirm the same doctrine — ^andthat the rights and privileges of London, belonged to thosewho were of the place, and not to aliens or strangers ; and thatthis was connected with inhabitancy ^ and the law as to resiancy,which was then practised in the courts leet throughout thecountry.

Exemption frompontage and pannage was also given.succeuovd. We should observe, that this charter (unlike the fonder)is granted to the citizens and their successors. We havebefore remarked, in our extracts from Bracton, that the doctrineof the Universitas was promulgated in his compilation.And we have seen from many documents, that the appellationof '^ successors" had been long before given to ecclesiasticalbodies. It seems about this period, the term was appliedalso in some instances, to municipal bodies ; although grantsto other places were made as before to the burgesses andtheir heirs.In our extracts from Fata, we shall hereafter see that theterm was used in that compilation with respect to the ecclesiasticalbodies, together with some of the doctrines morepeculiarly applicable to corporations. Still it is clear, thatthe general doctrine of corporations was not at that timeapplied to municipal bodies, particularly with respect toelections, or admissions into the liberties of the place. Andit would appear, that the adoption of this term was ratherthe effect of accident than intention ; for we find in the succeedingreign, that charters were again granted to the citizensand their heirs.In the close of this charter to London, it is introducedparenthetically, that the city, mayoralty, and liberties, hadbeen long since taken into the king's hands, who had acustos appointed over them, for no less a period than 12 years.This, no doubt, was intended to operate a$ a re-grant of theirLONDON. 549previous privileges ; and we find, that in this year%hey re- Edward i.turned members to Parliament.*It was also about this period that the divisions of the city Wards,(originally called aldermanries), began to be known solelyby the name of wards (as they have been called ever since;)and toardrmotesy or courts leet were held in them : — and certainpersons being chosen out of the inhabitants ofeachwardyto form the inquest, or jury, who presented all* nuisances, andmatters incurable at the Uetj to the cddemian, and assistedhim in the general government and police of the ward.Thus we see, that in London, as in Norwich, Yarmouth,Ipswich, and Canterbury, aldermanries, wards, and leets,were in fact synonymous and the wards, and ward-motes,continue to this day; as to the original constitution of which,or the nature of the functions of the alderman or the courtleet, it is impossible to entertain a doubt.As one of the distinct proofs that these juries performeda most important office, in giving vent to the real or supposedgrievances of the people, we find that in the thirdyear of Edward I., "the juries of the several wards present 1274.ted to the justices in Eyre, that the mayors and guardiansof the city, had been used to load them with arbitrary and'* unauthorized talliages, and unequal assessments."In the 12th year of this reign, we meet with an occurrence i283.which establishes, that the Tower of London, like the castles ^0^20X1*^in most other boroughs, was out of the city ; for the mayorbeing summoned before the justices in Eyre at the Tower,conceiving he was not bound to go out of the city, formallydeposed himself before he entered the Tower gates, and wentin only as a private citizensIn the following year, a statute was passed, directing that 1284.the aldermen should make strict search for offenders, andallow none hut freemen to reside in the city.

Alb. fol. 116. Norton, 113. + Lib. Horn ; Lib. F. in fine.X Slat. Civ. Lord. Norton, 115.660 LONDON.Edward I. Mr. horton, in his valuable commentaries upon the historyand constitution of London,* from which we have extractedmuch valuable matter, seems to consider that the privil^eswitt respect to forced lodging, and the residence of foreignmerchants, were peculiar to the city of London; — ^but^ as thereader has already seen, the former was an immunity containedin almost all the charters to other boroughs ; and thelatter formed a part of the general law of the land.Upon the re-grant of the privileges in the 26th of EdwardL, to which we have before adverted, the aldermen, with the12 jury-men from each ward, chose, or mither presented thenew mayor ; — a mode of appointment perfectly consistent withthe principles and spirit of our ancient law.Present Speaking correctly, the term presentment, and not election,ought to be here applied. A distinction material to benoted : — because from the disregard of it, many of theactual abuses, and the greater portion of the misconceivednotions upon this subject, have been introduced.If election imports an arbitrary will, without reference tothe circumstances which ought to have an imperative controlover the persons electing, then the term is misapplied to thisproceeding; — because it was the duty of the jury at theward-mote or court leet, to appoint or present many officers,as the important functionaries of the law ; such as the constables— the head-boroughs — the beadles — ^Euid a variety ofothers, unnecessary to enumerate. In the appointment ofthese individuals, they were bound to regard the mostfit and proper persons for the respective offices ; with referencealso' to the turn and succession in which the partiesought to serve. So that it was the bounden duty of the jury,under the solemn sanction of their oaths, to select — appoint —nominate — or elect, (if the term is strictly used in thatsense,) the person, who, according to their real judgmentand belief, was the fit and proper individual; consideringupon the one hand, for the sake of the public, the fitness ofthe party; and upon the other, for keepsake of the individual,this liability in proper turn to serve the office. — thus were the• Page 116.^c2fe^-LONDON. 551rights both of the public and individuals secure in this Edward d i. •reasonable and practical manner, by the oaths of the jury.Had the simplicity of this ancient system never been departedfrom neither would the loose notions of the electivefranchise, or the looser principles applied to its exercise, soinjuriously prevailed as we have since witnessed. Norwould the introduction of various usages in the differentboroughs, whereby the whole system was involved in mystery,have opened a door to the tricks and frauds, which inmodem times have disgraced the elective franchise. — Neitherwould there have been any difficulty in checking the .baneful influence of those frauds, and restoring the exertcite of the elective franchise to the legal influence of responsiblesworn functionaries and correct principle, by the resumptionof this ancient — venerable — and practical system.Neither should the statesman — the politician — or the philosopher— overlook the demoralizing effect of the superinducedintricate system, with its concomitant frauds, which has solong existed ; nor upon the other hand fail to anticipate thesure and social compact of society, which would arise fromthe execution of these functions, under the responsibility ofoaths in a public court, before the people, who serving in successionupon the juries, would themselves participate in theadministration of the laws, and know by their own experiencethat all was done fairly, and under the control of honestprinciples. Mr. Norton, in this part of his book,* seems toerr in supposing that the persons nominated at the ward-motes,were the council of the aldermen or the mayor. Theseterms used in their present sense, serve to mislead the judgment,and draw it away from the correct view of the subject.The notion of a council implies in the minds of most per- Commonsons at the present day, a notion of discretionary and unrestrainedwill; in that sense the word is totally inapplicableto the bodies of whom the author is speaking. They hadno self will or discretion — they were the juries — bound bytheir oaths to do what was right, not what they wished. Andhowever minute, upon a superficial view, this distinction• Page 115.552 BRISTOL.— Heron.Edward 1. may seei^ it is the point upon which all these mattersdepend. Upon its misconception the abuses which harebeen the subject of complaint have arisen ; and it is only bycorrected views upon this subject that these errors can besolidly and permanently rectified.The probability is, that as the author was mistaken incalling the jury of the wards the ** councilmen' so he wasalso mistaken in supposing that the lists in the Liber Alasof 1285, were the common councilmen of the mayor.*Bristol. Besides the charters and documents of this reign, whichwe have quoted with respect to London, Bristol also hada grant to the burgesses and their successors that theyshould be exempt from murage, &c. ; and that they mightchoose their mayor (and like the grant to the citizens ofLondon), present him to the constable of the castle of Bristol.A mandate to that effect was issued, reciting, that theking had so granted to the burgesses and whole commonaltyof the town of Bristol.We must remember, that as the mayor of London wasdirected to be sworn before the constable of the Tower, sohere he was directed to be sworn before the constable of thecastle of Bristol ; and we have shown, that the Tower ofLondon was without the city; it will be seen, that thecastle of Bristol was similarly circumstanced.1272. Edward L also confirmed the charter of King John to theburgesses of Hedon — the borough at fee-farm — and the sameprivileges as the city of York : — reserving, amongst otherthings, the rents of the king's native bondmen. Power wasgiven to hold a wapentake — that they might have a coroner,and all proper officers were to be elected annually from amongthemselves. That they might have a seal for recognizancesof debts; and that no burgess should plead without the town.That they might have infangthef and outfangthef. That theyand their heirs might hold their lands freely, and be free oftolls ; and that the same burgesses, their heirs and successors,should not be put in assises or juries without the town.• Lib.

That the burgesses shouldnot be convicted by foreigners: — ^that they might have amerchant guild: — and assise of bread. That no clerk ofthe market of the king should interfere. That they shouldhave the return and execution of all writs, without anyimpediment from the king's steward or marshal.It is hardly necessary to observe, though it should not bealtogether omitted, that all the privileges of this charter areclearly of a local character ; and seem distinctly to import,that they were to be enjoyed by all the inhabitants who couldpay scot and lot, and by them only.Before we proceed to the consideration of the Welsh and P»'^»*-ment .Irish boroughs, it may be desirable to remark upon a few ^^^^'passages which are extracted from the Parliament Rolls ofthis reign; in which, however, there is a chasm from the 6thto the 18th year.These valuable records, amongst other things, illustrate Countiesthat distinction between counties, cities and boroughs, rough.which we have before so frequently noticed. In the 21st ^^^•of Edward I., the under-sheriff was directed not to im-paneljurors in the county unless they were worth 40«., norout of the county unless 51. ; but in cities and towns (thatis, towns having separate jurisdictions), it is directed to beas in former times accustomed."fAs confirmatory of the continuance in practice of the law i*290.of villainage at this time, and explaining the term " freemen" vauinige.in a document upon these rolls, but which we have alsobefore quoted from the London records, we find, that Nicholasde Launceston, who had demised to Adam de Stratton,nine villains in Overstratton, for the term of the life of the• So ic Cinque Port Charters, " gander violences." &c. 1 Pet.

The sheriff of York was also, commanded to distraincertify villains of William de Latimer — viz. Robert Alygod,&c. &c. And to have their bodies before the king in 15days of St. Michael to answer a plea of trespass.As we have before seen, that the juries of the wards inLondon presented to the justices in Eyre, their complaintsagainst the exactions of the mayor and sheriffs of London,1290. so we find that the commonalty of the town of Gloucestercomplained that the patentes — the principal men of the towntaxed them immoderately — and prayed, that the causeand quantity of every talliage levied on them might be as .curtaineddecenna. As a. proof also that the doctrine of the decenna wasin full force in this reign, we find an entry upon the .alimentary Roll of the 6th of Edward L4 which states, thata certain native bondman of a lord had taken sanctuary inthe church of St. Burial, and remained there, with hiswife, half a year and more ; but the sheriff of Cornwallordered him to be taken, and to be brought before him, forthat he had withdrawn himself from the decennUf in whichhe before was : and the sheriff compelled him to re-enter it,and made him be sworn.This document, though it clearly shows that the doctrineof the decenna was in full practice at this time, apparentlyrequires some explanation. For it is difficult to say, how anative bondman could be liable to be sworn, unless he hadresided a year and a day in the place. It would seem, atthe first view, that in this instance the party had resided onlyhalf a year. Upon the question of villainage, therefore, ifthis were the only fact, there would be some difficulty, so asto reconcile it with the laws and documents we have previouslyextracted. But the probable solution is, that thenative bondman, who is stated to have been before in thedecenna, had resided in the place more than a year and a• Pet. Pari. p. 61. n. 194. t Plac.

Pari. p. 192. t Pic. ParL p. 217.666 CORNWALL.Edward I. It is iftw very difficult, satisfactorily to account for theearly paucity of its boroughs, and the subsequent extensiveincrease of them.Sj^^niry Moreover one of the striking characteristics of this county,was the establishment of the Stannary Laws; and it is by nomeans improbable, that the exclusive jurisdiction given tothe Stannary Courts, may afford the real explanation to thepeculiar facts mentioned above. At least, as we have seenin the course of our investigation, that the exclusion of thejurisdiction of the sheriff of the county was the substantialfeature distinguishing a borough — so, till a better hypothesisis suggested, it seems reasonable to assume, that exclusivejurisdiction, though arising out of different circumstances,might have produced the same result in this county.We find, that at this date, Edward I. granted a charterfor the establishment of the Statuaries* by which it wasprovided, that all the senators working in them, whichwere the king's demesnes, whilst they worked there, mightbe free of pleas of natives, and all pleas in any way touchingthe king's court. That they should not answer before theking's justices or ministers, but before the warden of theStannaries. And that they might be free of talliages, tolls,stallages, aids, and other customs.This charter was confirmed in Parliament, in the 35thof Edwaid I., 1st of Edwaid III, 17th of Edwaid III., and50th Edward III.It will appear, that it is subsequent to these periodsthat the bulk of the Cornish charters were granted by theDuke of Cornwall to the Cornish boroughs. And as noneof the provisions in this original charter are of a corporatecharacter, or tend in any manner to raise the inference, thatthey were intended to give any corporate powers or jurisdictions— so also it will be found, that the subsequentcharters were not grants of incorporation, till after thosegrants became common in otliar parts of the kingdom.♦ See Pearce's Stannary Laws.YEAR BOOKS.-NORWICH.-CINQUE PORTS. 557Edward I.YEAR BOOKS.With respect to the Year Books, which contain the earliest Yeardecisions in the courts of law now extant, and which commencein this reign, we would observe generally, tha^theyconfirm the doctrines and usages in the ancient laws, and inthe charters and customs of the several boroughs.The officers of the Exchequer* are declared to be exemptfrom suits of shires and hundreds, as long as they are engagedin the business of the king.It is clear, from this exemption claimed and allowed to theking's officers in the Exchequer, by the judgment of thebarons, how important this freedom was, which we have previouslyseen granted in the charters of Henry II., John, andHenry III.The inquisitions entered in these Records, appear to betakenby the class of persons to whom we have so frequentlyreferred, ^* the good and lawful men," and '' the free andlawful men."+Those who wished to trade in Norwich are stated to con Norwich,tribute with the citizens, in talliages and other aids; and thesheriff was directed to make the men holding of the fee of thecastle (which would appear, like other castles, to be in other■respects, out of the jurisdiction of the city), and all otherstrading in the city were to contribute in talliages and aidswith the citizens.The exemption of the baron s of the Cinque Ports from CinquePorts.serving upon ahy inquisitions, is spoken of generally, withoutreference to any particular port — confirming the identity oftheir privileges, for which we have before contended.And there is a writ to the constable of Dover castle, andwarden of the Cinque Ports, to summon one of Winchelsea,to answer for what cause they had taken the wines of foreignmerchants in London, and had defrauded the king of thecustom.Mem.

The bailiff of the city of Hereford was committed to prisonfor 20/., which the citizens of that city owed.From this case, as well as the one quoted before, relativeto Dunwich, in the 54th of Henry III., it appears, that theissues of the city belonged to the king ; and that the paymentof them was enforced by proceedings in the Exchequer,against the bailiff alone.London. The mayor and other citizens of London, came before thebarons and admitted, that Bartholomew, the keeper of theExchange of Liondon,;|: and other officers of the Exchange,should not contribute with them, as long as they are officersof the Exchange, for any talliage in any case, &c.; and that»they should not be compelled to keep watch with the samecitizens but when they were willing.The mayor and citizens are here mentioned, not as corporators,but with reference to one of those duties which aroseout of the general law before adverted to, namely, thekeeping watch and ward — a duty to be performed by theresident householders.There is also the following entry in this year, as to thetellarii, or weavers of Oxford —Oxford.

And itseems from the whole case, that they were only a few personsbelonging to a particular craft. The borough, mayor andbailiffs of Oxford are also mentioned ; but nothing relative toany corporate rights.That the men and tenants of ecclesiastical persons werefree from geld, appears from a writ in the Year Sooky-fwhereby the sheriff of Surrey was directed, to pennit themen and tenants of the Prior of Merton to be quit fromthe levy of a common fine upon the commonalty of thatcounty J because they were not reliable in the county.The entry recites: that the tenants, and men of the Prior of Prior andMerton, in the county of Surrey, were not geldable^ nor have not geld-heretoforeever been amerced on the iter of the justices inthe said county, with the commonalty of the same county, nor Commonsto their amerciaments ; and the barons heavily county.distrain the same men to contribute with the commonalty ofthe same county to a certain common fine, which the samecommodity have made for many offences, before the justices Countylast travelling, to the injury, &c.

That the merchants and their associates, should pay 200marks towards the repairs, and should in future repair thesame as often as should be necessary ; and should bear a thirdWard. part of the ward, which ought at proper times to be kept forthe defence of the gate, at their expence, with their men ;and the mayor and citizens of London, should bear two-thirdsof such ward, &c.2.

And these concessions were transcribedupon the rolls, and under the seal of the Exchequer, and wereto be delivered to each party.This important record will illustrate some parts of ourearly institutions, to which we have before referred. We haveseen that all persons residing, or commorant within any place,beyond forty days, were bound to be there sworn to theirallegiance : — to contribute to the public burden of the place,pecuniary and personal, by paying scot, and bearing lot: —and if they did not at the end of a year, they were liableto be amerced. For the same reason also, if a villain lived ayear and a day within a place away from his lord, he becamefree ; because he also was bound to be so sworn, and to bearthe same burdens, which would be incompatible with hissituation as a villain. So also foreigners were, after the samelapse of time, partially subject to these liabilities : and thereare many instances where foreigners residing a certain timein a place were directed to be in scot and lot.It appears likewise from this record, that the merchants ofthe German hanse, were commorant, that is, permanently residentin the city of London : — they were therefore liable to thecommon burdens of the place, one of which would be the repairof the gates and walls ; and it-would seem that, residing nearBishopsgate, in order to relieve themselves from generalliability to the repair of the gates and walls, and to cover theirformer arrears, they agree to pay 200 marks for the past, andwere for the future to do the whole of the repairs of the gate,and be exempt from mure ; they are to do one-third partof the ward of the gate, the citizens doing the other two-thirds; they are to sell their com, &c., for 40 days : — As theinhabitant householders within the several wards, had at theirVide Mad.

'and other good men, of Benmck-uponrTweedy to the endthat the several bodies convened in one place might haveamongst them one will, and one firm and sincere regard theone to the other.In passing, we should observe, that Lambard derives** guild " from the Saxon language, and says, that it signifiesa society of religious persons, or those employed inmechanical arts, or merchants ; but he does not allude to anyconnection which they were supposed by some necessarilyto have with boroughs, within which however they weregenerally located.The first '^faq)ter of these laws says, Forasmuch as no par Cap. i*titular congregation of burgesses should violate in any thingthe liberties or laws of the general guild, or conceive newdevices against it, all particular guilds and societies hithertoholden within the borough should be abrogated, and theirgoods should pertain to this guild. And that they shouldnot presume to keep any other guild except this within the• Mem. Scac. Trin. T. 23 Edw. I. * f Mem. Sctc. Mic. T. 24 Edw. I.X Mem. Seme. Trin. T. 26 Edw. I.oo26G4 SCOTLAND. MERCHANT GUILDS.Edward I. borough ; but that, respect being had by all the membersto one had, one society may be kept and observed in alltheir acts and doings.The term " burgesses" appears to be introduced in thischapter only as a description of those inhabitants of theborough who were members of the guilds : — it certainly w^snot used for the purpose of asserting that all the burgesseswere members of the guilds : — because it refers to the particularcongregations of the former guilds and societies, whichincluded those only who were desirous of belonging to them,and which were for the future all to be absorbed in thegeneral guild of merchants — as it is expressly called — not ofburgesses.It seems difficult at this day to account for the powerassumed by the mayor, and the other framers of these laws, ofabrogating the other guilds — of creating a new one — and ofappropriating to it all the goods of the former guilds. Andmany other of the subsequent provisions of these laws appearto be illegal — particularly those which require legacies to beCap. 9. given to the guild by the brethren. The 9th chapter suppliesa provision for old age and sickness, which seems rather toresemble the rules of the modem friendly societies, than tobe connected with the common law.It is however clear, from the short extracts above, as wellas from others which will be mentioned hereafter, that theguild was perfectly distinct from the borough ; — ^that the burgessesexisted before and independently of it; — and that itwas optional in each burgess whether he would embodyhimself in the guild or not.Cap. 2. Thus again the 2d chapter states, that all forfeitures (exceptthe king's customs), and such as pertain to the rights andcommon liberty of the provost and baillies, should pertainto the guild. Which seems to admit, that the rights of theprovost and baillies, who were the borough officers, weredistinct from those of the guilds.Cap. 8. Chapter 8 provides, that no man should be received intothe fraternity of the guild, for a less sum than 40^., exceptthey were guild sons and guild daughters.Scotland-MERCHANT GUILDS. 565It has been previously shown that the guild was distinct Edwaiti i.from the borough. But it seems more than probable that^hislaw afterwards afforded to corporations — when they weredisposed to usurp and exercise exclusively the discretionaryClad arbitrary power of making burgesses, and likewisedesirous of increasing their finances — the precedent for sellingtheir freedom, in the same manner as admissions into guildsvere sold. The admission of females, who, by the commonlaw, were exempted from service at the court leet, and neveri¥ere admitted as burgesses, still farther establishes the distinctionbetween the guild and the borough.The laws for sending the brethren's daughters to nunneriesfor burying the brethren — and supporting them when indifficulties; — with the exclusion of those who stubbornlycontemn the guild; — seem also to be perfectly distinct fromthe laws of the boroughs.It nevertheless appears from some of these laws, that therewere burgesses, as we have noted above, who were unitedwith them; but this produces no real difficulty, because therecan be no doubt but that a man might be both a member ofthe guild, and a burgess ; and in all probability, the greaterportion of the burgesses were members of the guild : — but,in considering the subject of our inquiry, it is essentiallynecessary to keep our conception of the two characters distinctfrom each other, as essentially different both in originand nature — the one being derived from the common law,and directly connected with the police and performance ofpublic duties : — the other arising originally from the mutualcompact of individuals, first for religious purposes, and subsequentlyas connected with trade.There are many laws of the guild which are the sameas those of the borough : but more of the former than of thelatter relate to trade and are directed against forestallingand monopoly. There are also provisions for keeping thesecrets of the guild — against conspiracies to separate ordivide it ; — for the election of mayor, and four baillies of theguild, and for the appointment of 24 men, who appear toform a body much resembling the council of modern corseSCOTLAND.—MERCHANT Guilds.Edward I. portions : — it being obvious, that all institutions of this kindwould, shore or less, borrow their forms and regulations frooieach other.Cap. 35. The 35th chapter directs, that those who reveal the i^ecietiof file guild, should lose the liberty of the burgh ; whichseems to be an assumption of power in the framing of theselaws, they could not maintain ; for inasmuch as it has beenshown before, and is proved, both by the ancient and modemusage, that the right to be a burgess, and to enjoy, withoutinterruption, the privileges of the borough, was an absoluteright, depending upon certain quaJifiaUianSf and not uponelection — it would seem contrary to common right, that sucha body as the guild should have the power of ousting himfrom these privileges, for a supposed injury to themselves;indeed, it appears as if the framers of these laws werethemselves aware of this objection, and therefore endeavouredto bring persons so offending, within some disability of thecommon law, as by stating them to be infamous ; and thatthey^should not use the liberty of that or any other borough,which would undoubtedly be the consequence at the commonlaw, if they really were infamous — although they could notbe so severely treated for a fault of such a trivial nature, asthat of mentioning the secrets of the guild.Cap. 45. The 45th chapter recognizes the distinction betweenbrethren of the guild, and burgesses — stating that the forfeituresof stranger merchants, should belong to the brethrenof the guild and the burgesses of the town.Cap. 46. The 46thchapteralsospeaksof burgessesanrfbrethrenoftheguild, dwelling out of the burgh ; and prohibits their sellingwithin the burgh, except upon market days. The inferencearising from which, we have clearly pointed out, in our observationsupon the 108th chapter of the Leges Bui^orum.As a farther proof that the guild was more immediatelyconnected with trade than the borough, which united itselfwith the common law and municipal government, it may beobserved, that in the Chalmers Eyre, annexed to the Re-gram Majestatem, one of the charges against forestallers is,** that they use guild merchandises'WALES.— MONIGOM^RY.-LAMPADOR. 567These extracts are sufficient to inform the reader of the ^^^^^'£general character of the bye-laws, which related to the guildsin Scotland ; and will show, that in that country, as well asin England, the guilds were essentially distinct and separateiix>m the Ic^l constitution of the boroughs, raopngthemselves under different principles, and having in view,different objects.WALES.With respect to Wales, which submitted to the conqueringsword of this warlike monarch, we find the following documents:—The bailiffs of Montgomery complain, that the men of the ^JjJJ*®'town were impleaded for foreign matters.* This seems to as *277.some, that they had an exclusive jurisdiction, and that theywere not compelled to plead without the town — a privilege wehave seen granted to so many of the English boroughs.The king granted that Ikimpadar might be a free borough ;t ''■jSES*®'-that the burgesses might have a guild-merchant, with a hanseand other liberties and customs belonging to it — ^that no onewho was not of the guild-merchant, should make any merchandisethere, unless with the consent of the burgesses ofthe borough. The charter then contains the provision whichhas occurred so often in those of England, according to thelaw laid down in Glanville, that whoever had remained forayear and a day in the borough without claim, should notbe liable to be reclaimed by his lord. Soc, sac, toll, them,are then given, and all the liberties which the citizens ofMontgomery had. This charter is, in all its essential parts,the same as the English ; and establishes, that this place, aswell as Montgomery, were upon the same footing, and had allthe same distinguishing characteristics, arising as well fromthe charters, as from the common law.The king granted also, that the town of Carnarvon should Carnarvonbe a free borough, and that the men of the town should befree burgesses. That the constable of the castle should b^♦ Pet. Pari. p. 6, n. 26. t Rot. Cart. 6 Edward I. n. 24.X Rot.

That they might have a merchant guild,and that no one not of the guild should make any trafficin the town, unless by the consent of the burgesses. Thecommon clause as to native bondmen, and the usual grantas to soc, sac, toll, them, and infangthef follow. Also theprovision as to the wills of burgesses, and those who died intestate.And that the burgesses should not be convicted byany strangers, but only by the burgesses. Reference ismade to the liberties of the city of Hereford, whose charterwas confirmed by many subsequent kings, and by QueenElizabeth ; as well as by Parliament in the fourth year ofKing Henry IV.iiavcrford- This king also granted to the burgesses of Waterford all^■^^» the customs which the burgesses of Cardigan had. Thatthey might elect every year three good and lawful men; outof whom one was to be elected bailiff. Provision is addedrespecting the wills of the burgesses, and those who diedintestate. And also freedom from toll.It is clear from these charters, that all the Welshboroughs had in substance the same privileges, which arehere recognized as belonging to the boroughs of Cardiff* —Montgomery — Labrador — Carnarvon — and Waterford ; andthat all those privileges were in fact the same as thosewhich the English boroughs enjoyed ; as is expressly statedto be the case with respect to Carnarvon and Hereford ; andit will be remembered as to the latter place, that many ofthe English charters referred to its privileges. A genera]identity therefore, of the rights and privileges of the Welshboroughs with those of the English, may be reasonablyassumed from these records, confirmed as they will be byothers we shall hereafter quote.IRELAND.— DUBLIN-centres. 569Edward I.IRELAND.With respect to Ireland, we find that the charter of King Dublin.John to the city o{ Dublin was confirmed in this reign, andthe citizens were discharged from sums and fines said ^ be ^due to the crown.The charters of Henry III., (including the election ofmayor, and freedom from murage, &c., and toll, &c.,) werealso confirmed, with other grants at fee-farm.Waterford and Dundalk likewise received charters in thisreign.As those to Dublin chiefly consist in the confirmations offormer privileges, which we have seen to be the same asthose granted to the English boroughs ; we may assume asto Ireland, as we have done with respect to Wales, that theprivileges of the Irish boroughs continued in this reign thesame as those of the English.It appears that Ireland was, like Wales, in ancient times Caiitreds.divided into centres, which were analogous to our hundreds.Thus in the first year of the reign of King John, there is agrant to Hame de Valerian of Limerick, of two centres ofHochville, by the service often knights.*In a grant to Thomas Fitz Maurice, the centred of Fonsis mentioned ; — and in one to Lamlekyn Fitzwilliam,the centred of Julien.The centres of Ireland are also mentioned in other records,in the 2nd and 17th of King John.Many burgages in Limerick are stated in these records, — burgages.as well as in the 17th year of the reign of King JohnsIn the fifth of King John, the city of Limerick was grantedto William de Breosa, to hold in ward at will.And the same of Dublin ; 7th Johns;Some authors have thought that the lawson England wereintroduced into Ireland before the charter of John, by hisfather Henry 11. ; — and this opinion is enforced by thetestimony of Matthew Paris, an historian in the reign ofHenry IIL, who writes, that " Rex Henries, antequam exRot.

And so he states the rule to be in the fourth InstepHe also cites the Year Book of 1 Henry VII., which, as asubsequent decision, overrules the authority of that in thereign of Richard III. — And Lord Coke's explanation ofCalvin's case evinces his opinion the more strongly, becauseIreland, if considered as distinct in government from England,would have been a more apt instance to support his doctrinein favour of the post nati of Scotland's We do not, however,intend by these observations to offer any opinion as tothe controversy respecting the political connection betweenEngland and Ireland. It is a subject of too much importance,extent, and delicacy, — as well as foreign to our present pursuits,for us needlessly to encounter; the reader desirousof pursuing the subject, may refer to the 6 Geo.

The statute ofHenry III., with respect to the keeping of the gates of citiesand great boroughs, and the receiving of strangers, is introduced; as well as the inquiry every 15 days, concerning strangers,guests, and their receivers. Also the watch at thegates of cities, and by 12 men in every borough, and four menincounty towns, according to the size of the town.The 27th chapter relates to fugitives the hue and cry, and Cap. 27../,,- 11 1 . . .1 Fugitives.the pursuit of the fugitives ; as well as the inquiry nth respectto the decenna to whom the fugitives belonged ; and whenthey were in free borgh. The town receiving such a personwho was not in frank-pledge, is directed to be amerced, unless672 FLETA.-DECENNA.^^*^^' he were a knight or a clerk. The amercement of him alsoin whos#manupast hewa^^^ mentioned.^IbttB it is evident.itnat the oriole ancient system of theSaxon laws was still in full force : — and the exceptions forparticular classes of persons from the liability to do suit atthe sheriff's toum^ or the local leet, to which we have beforealluded are expressly stated ; as the archbishops — bishopsearls — barons — and nobles of that description, who oughtto have their knights, squires, butlers, &c., in their " freeboughs," for whom they should answer. All others, of 12years and upwards, ought to be in free borgh or decenna, andshould take the oath of fidelity to the king and his heirs,that they would not be, nor consent to, robbers; — and whenany person has done this, then he shall not be at liberty towithdraw himself at his own will, from the decenna, nor tobe expelled against his. will from his free borgh. Nor oughtany person to have as his manupast, him whom he has hadas his guest for more than three nights.In these provisions of the Saxon laws, asserted again inFleta, we find the obligation, and right of every free inhabitantto be doom and enrolled in the decenna, and to be putin free borgh : — and any person being so sworn and enrolled,was not liable to be put out of it against his \nll ; — or inother words, according to modem language, to be disfrcaurchased: — ^which in truth, embraces the whole substance ofthe rights and privileges now claimed by burgesses and freemen: — though they are mistakenly supposed to be peculiarlyapplicable to corporations : whereas their real origin andmeaning, as well as the principles applicable to them, are tobe searched for in these, our early rudiments of the commonlaw.The chapter then proceeds fully with the doctrine ofoutlawry and bail ; — likewise that infants and women couldnot be outlawed. It then adds the formidable doctrineof the " caput lupin," which occurs in the Saxon laws,and in the legal treatises to which we have previouslyadverted.FLETA.-FRANK-PLEDGE. 673In the 47th chapter, certain liberties are mentioned, as Edward I.ss»c — ^borgh — infangthef — forganthef — soke — sake^toU — Cap. 47. '\^liem — free borgh — lestage, Jbc. AH which terms are shortlyIb^ut distinctly defined. — None are material to our presentinquiry, except " soke," which is the liberty of holds acourt : — " sake," which is the freedom from suits of shiressuit hundreds : — and free borgh, which imports the systemof police, to which we have before frequently alluded ;^vrhereby every man-was bound in his decenna,*to those whosevere commorant near him, in pledges, each being pledge for Pledges.the other; so that if one commit a crime, the other nineshould be amenable to justice.The 51st chapter of the second book, relates to the king's ;J'»b- '^}-Cap. 01.native bondmen, and the mode of recovering fugitives.The send chapter relates to the king's tournj and describes Cap. 62.the court of the king, the tom of the sheriff, and the view of Turn.the hundreds, — which are directed to be held twice a year,according to Magna Charta. The view oi frank-pledge is to Francethe same, —and is directed to be so held, that the peaceshould be inviolably preserved ; and that the decennae shouldbe as full, as they were accustomed to be in the time of KingHenry.Amongst the articles of inquiry at the view of frankpledge,it is directed, that all the capital pledges, (which wehave seen to be, the juries,) should come as they ought to do,and that they should have their decennas, — so that all of 12years old might be in decenna. And of those who were notin decenna — as clerks, knights, &c. — it should be inquiredof whose manupast they were. And if any were wandering,of whom there was any suspicion, then it should be presentedwho were their receivers. Inquiry should also be made of the jvillains of the king living out of his demesnes : — and of themen of any lord being in another view. — So also as to the duekeeping of the watch. And it is there provided — which clearlyshows that the capital pledges were the grand jury — thatwhen they had answered distinctly to these heads, faith wasnot only to be given to their verdict, but also to the oath of12 freemen — the petty jury — ^who should be charged declare574 PLETAv^^"^ V the truth upon the indictments. It is added, that all freetenants yid free men should be sworn as suitors in the toursand views of frank-pledge : which is declared to have beckestablished in favour of peace.A^ the close of the same chapter, speaking of injuries ornuisances which had been done within a year and a day,it is directed, that if the party was present, he should answerto it immediately ; if he would not, or if he were absent, thecapital pledges should see it remedied. As to those whowere not in decenna, but offered themselves for it, and couldfind nine pledges, then having taken the oath of fidelity toEnrolling. (^^ king, and their names being enrolled, (omnibus irrotu*laths). each should be immediately delivered to his pledges.But they who should not have come as they ought — and thalso who had not their decennas as they ought — and theywho being above 12 years should not be in decenna — shouldbe amerced.Cap. 55. The 55th chapter states, that the king has his court alsoin cities and boroughs, as places exempt phocis exempts) —as in the hustings in London — winchester — Lincoln — ^YoriLStepped — and elsewhere; where the barons and citizenshave record in those things which are determined beforethem ; and where they ought to enjoy their customs accordingto Magna Charta. London, and other cities, boroughs andprivileged towns, and the barons of the Cinque Ports, areagain mentioned ; as well as the reeves of the liberty, calledSoke the soke-reeves. Privileges also are referred to the same asthose in the Saxon laws, and in the charters we have beforestated. And mayors and bailifis are mentioned.In these provisions therefore, we further recognize thecontinuance of the Saxon institutions; and the privilegesbefore enjoyed by London — Ipswich — and many otherplaces.Cap. 73. ^ the 73d chapter of the same book, bailiffs and prsspositiate mentioned.Q ^ 7^ . And the 76th chapter relates altogether to the prspositus.In the 11th chapter of the 4th book, which refers to theCap*. 11*. exceptions that might be taken to the condition of a man.Flea.— CONCLUSION. ^ 675■tube excommunicated and the bondmen are mentioned ; — and, Kdwmrd i.sus contradistinguished from the latter, the freemen. Those&l80 who residing in any city, privileged town, or demesneoF the king, for a year and a day, without the claim of thelord, or being privileged as clerks or knights (whose orderssuffice for privilege) were to be considered as free, unlessthey were degraded by some judgment.The Isti chapter of the 6th book relates to abbots:— cip. 18.sad the doctrine of incorporation, as relative to such ecclesiasticaldignitaries, to which we have before alluded in ourcontents upon Bracton, occurs again in this author to acertain qualified extent.Thus the seisin of the predecessors is spoken of: — because,it is added, *^ In colleges and chapters there always remainsthe same body, although they all successively die; as itmay be said of a flock of sheep, where there is always thesame flock, although the sheep successively die off. Nordoes either of them succeed to the other by right of succession;so that the right should descend hereditarily from oneto the other ; because the right always belongs to the church,and the church always remains."Here we see the doctrine of incorporation in its infancy,as applied to ecclesiastical bodies ; but it should always beremembered, that this doctrine was not at that time everapplied to municipal aggregate bodies. And we must hererepeat, with reference to this treatise, the observation wemade before, that the position of the non-existence of municipalcorporations at this period, is much strengthened bythese two circumstances, that there is no allusion to anyincorporated succession with respect to municipal bodies ; butthat such a succession with respect to ecclesiastical bodies isexpressly asserted*We have now completed our extracts from the statutes — Contusioncharters — municipal documents — and legal authorities of thisimportant reign; in which not only was the administrationof the law, and municipal government, both general andlocal, carried to a higher pitch of excellence than had CONCLUSION.Edward I. fore existed, — and, perhaps, without disparagement of Aepresent enlightened times, even than in any subsequentperiod, — but also that great change was effected in the constitution,which gave to the citizens and burgesses the rightof sing represented in Parliament.Yet notwithstanding all these improvements and changes, -none took place in the class of persons who formed the bodyof the citizens and burgesses. They undoubtedly continuedthe same as they had been during the Saxon times, and thesucceeding reigns ; and they were, beyond all question the^^ freemen*' that is, the men of free condition, inhabiting inthe places of which they were citizens or burgesses ; and soinhabiting, they were bound to contribute to the commonscot of the place, and to bear the lot or burden of the publicoffices, which were required to be performed there. Asanother part of their public duty, they were all bound, asresiants in the cities or boroughs, to attend at the court leetthere to take the oath of allegiance to the king, and to beenrolled with their pledges, that they might be forthcomingat all times to do right and justice, and to abide by the law :and by these means they became the liberi et legates hominesof the places where they inhabited: — ^that important class ofthe community so often mentioned in our ancient records andlaws — ^by whom all the important public functions, politicaland municipal, were executed.This was the indisputable state of things at this important2&m-^within the time of legal memory; — and at an epoch whenour constitution began to assume its more perfect form. Andit is with confidence affirmed, that these positions admit of nocontroversy, because the concurring testimony of all the lawswhich have been quoted,— those of our Saxon ancestor —those of William I. — Henry I. : — the great charters dr JbKn —Henry III. and Edward I.: — the statutes which were enactedthe local cJuirters which were from time to time grantedto the different cities and boroughs : — and the usages customand ordinances of all those places, in England, Scotland,Wales and Ireland: — all tend to establish, that these acts .to which we have referred, were the constant daily course ofCONCLUSION. 577practice throughout the kingdom. When we add to this, ^^^^ ^*that the doctrine of freedom — as resulting from birth — marriage— and absence from the lords, or service incompatibleivith their claims — has continued to be acted upon even tothe present period — though mistakenly applied to corporations: and that the mode of admitting to freedom, even tothis day, is by taking the oath of allegiance — enrolling thename — and the paying scot and lot, which is the necessaryconsequence of being householders — has, after the mostcareful and laborious investigation, been solemnly decidedto be what has been emphatically called the common lawright of burgess-ships and which actually prevailed in a greatportion of the cities and boroughs, down to the latest periods :it would seem unnecessary to add one word to establishpoints, so confirmed by law, principle, and practice : — wereit not, that inveterate habit and prejudice have closed theminds of a numerous class of individuals to the progress ofrational conviction.END OF VOL.
