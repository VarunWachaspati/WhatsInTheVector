This instrument was suspendedin my cabin, with the cistern at the level of the sea (excepting during the first eight months, whenit was placed six feet higher), and by it all the barometrical observations recorded in this table weretaken or corrected.In 1836, while conveying the same barometer by land from Woolwich to London, it was seriouslyinjured, and therefore, to give value to its indications while on board the Beagle, I annex some correspondingobservations, made at the Royal Observatory, and at Somerset House.EXTRACTTHE REGISTERS OF THE STANDARD BAROMETERS OF THEROYAL SOCIETY, AT SOMERSET HOUSE; AND OF THE ROYALOBSERVATORY, AT GREENWICH.*Day.Hour.as.

If his whole meridian distance between Guayaquil 1 1and Callao is incorrect, the error, whatever it may be, must be distributed equally along that {portion of coast, but I do not think there is an error of two miles ; probably, indeed, there is not 'near so great a deviation from truth, as Mr. Usborne landed for observations continually, andcandied a connected triangulation from Callao to Pun.OTHER POSITIONSASCERTAINED Anil USED TO CONTINUE THE CHAIN OF MERIDIAN DISTANCES.Not included in the Survey.Lat.South.Long.Var.East.Hew.R. his.//////h. m.Feet.Otaheite — Point Venus* — extremity17 29149 30 007 54continuing the chain of meridian dis-everydances westward from Bahia (in Brazil),day.Otaheite (Point Venus extremity) would [be in JAnd by taking the measures eastward fromBahia /149 34 30149 26 14The mean of the two is149 30 22The longitudes in the following list, from NewZealand to Ascension, are obtained by addingthe meridian distances eastward from Bahia.EAST,New Zealand — Bay of Islands — Paihia Islet36 16174 09 4514 009 «66 N.W.Sydney — Fort Macquarrie — flag-staff33 51151 17 0010 247 36Paramatta — Observatory151 04 00Hobart Town— Fort Margrave42 53147 24 1511 068 005 w.King George Sound — Princess Royal Har-"!^your — New Government Buildings .

King, Captain.To the Hon. George Elliot,Secretary of the Admiralty, &c. &c. &c.No. 2.Sir, London, May 23, 1831.Enclosed is a copy of the letter sent to Captain P. P. King (thencommanding H. M.'s sloop Adventure), by the Secretary of theAdmiralty, relative to the natives of Tierra del Fuego, who werebrought to England in the Beagle ; and I have to request that youwill honour me by submitting the enclosed copy, and the purport ofthis letter, to my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.The proper season for the return of these Fuegians is nowdrawing near. They have been with me fourteen months, and atleast five months more must elapse before they can reach their ownshores.APPENDIX. 91They have always expected to return during the ensuing winter(summer of their country), and should they be disappointed, I fearthat discontent and disease may be the consequence.Having been led to suppose that a vessel would be sent to SouthAmerica to continue the survey of its shores, and to explore partsyet unknown, I hoped to have seen these people become usefulas interpreters, and be the means of establishing a friendly dispositiontowards Englishmen on the part of their countrymen, if notaregular intercourse with them.By supplying these natives with some animals, seeds, tools, &c.,and placing them, vdth some of their own tribe, on the fertilecountry lying at the east side of Tierra del Fuego, I thought that,in a few years, ships might have been enabled to obtain fresh provisions,as well as wood and water, during their passage from theAtlantic to the Pacific Ocean, on a part of the coast which canalways be approached with ease and safety.If their Lordships should so far approve of these ideas as to grantme any assistance in carrying them into execution, I shall feel deeplygratified, and shall exert every means in my power ; but should theynot be thought worthy of attention and support, I humbly requestthat their Lordships will grant me twelve months' leave of absencefrom England, in order to enable me to keep my faith vidth the nativesof Tierra del Fuego, by restoring their countrymen, and by doingthem as much good as can be effected by my own very limited means.I have, &c.,Robert Fits-Rot, Commander.To the Hon. George Elliot,Secretary to the Admiralty, &c. &c. &c.In June I received twelve months' leave of absence from England,and made the following agreement with Mr. Mawman, a shipowner,of London.No. 3.Memorandum of Agreement made the eighth day of June, inthe year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty-one,between John Mawman, of Stephen Causeway, London, merchant.92 APPENDIX.o-\vner of the brig or vessel called The John, of two hundredtons register burthen, now lying in the London Dock, whereofJohn Davy is Master, on the one part, and Robert Fits-Roy, aCommander in His Majesty's Royal Navy, of the other part.The said John Mawman agrees with the said Robert Fits-Roy,in manner following : —That the said master, or such other master as the said JohnMsLwraan shall appoint, shall receive the said Robert Fits-Roy andhis friends and servants, not exceeding in the whole six persons, onboardthe said brig or vessel, and proceed v/Ith them forthwith toSouth America, to such one or two port or ports, or place or places,as the said Robert Fits-Roy shall order and direct, such port or ports,or place or places, not to be north of Valparaiso ; and at the first portor place, or so near thereto as the said vessel may safely get, to benamed by the said Robert Fits-Roy, to land the said Robert Fitzroyand his said friends and servants, or such of them as the saidRobert Fits-Roy shall require, and receive them, or such of them asthe said Robert Fits-Roy shall require, on board again ; and thenceforthwith to proceed to the second port or place, or so near thereto asthe said vessel may safely get, to be named by the said Robert Fitzroy,there to land such of them, the said Robert Fits-Roy and hisfriends and servants, as shall not have been already landed at thesaid first-named port or place, and receive the said Robert Fits-Roy,and such other or others of the last-mentioned persons, as he shallrequire again on board the said vessel, and forthwith proceed to andland him or them at Valparaiso.That the said Robert Fits-Roy shall be at liberty to put on boardstock and provender, at such places as may be agreed upon, portcharges and pilotage being paid by the said Robert Fits-Roy.That John Mawman wil find and provide the said Robert Fitzroy,and the said other persons, vnth aU suitable and proper customaryprovisions, stores, wines, beer, and spirits.And the said Robert Fits-Roy agrees with the said John Mawman,his executors and administrators, as follows : —That he will not detain the said brig or vessel at either of theports or places to be named by him, as herein before mentioned, anylonger than shall be reasonably necessary to enable him and the saidother persons safely to land, re-embark, and finally land at the saidports respectively.APPENDIX. 93That he will pay to the said John Mawman, his executors oradministrators, as the compensation for the agreement liereinbeforecontained on the part of the said John Mawman, the sum of onethousand pounds sterling, to be paid down prior to embarkation.As witness the hands of the said parties.Witness, Robert Fits-Roy.W. H. WooLLETT. John Mawman.W. Wackerbarth.No. 4.Salisbury Square,My dear Sir, November 10, 1831.Matthews left town this morning to join the Beagle at Plymouth,being detained tiU to-day for the steamer.We have provided Matthews vdth all such articles as appearedto be necessary for him, and which could be most advantageously suppliedin this country. These had aU been completed before I learnedfrom Mr. Wilson that you are short of stowage. I hope, however,they vdll not be found to amount to a quantity to occasion youinconvenience ; and I think you will be of opinion that no part ofhis outfit could, with propriety, be dispensed with, in case Matthewsbecomes a permanent resident in Tierra del Fuego.Mr. Wilson and myself concurred in opinion that a letter shouldbe addressed by us to Matthews, in reference to the undertaking onwhich he is about to enter. This I have drawn up at Mr. W.'srequest, and hoped to have procured the addition of his signatureto it ; but a pressure of other engagements has compelled me todrive it off til it is too late to send it to him for that purpose. Ihave no doubt, however, that it expresses his general views on thesubject. If you should think I have dwelt too much on the religiousbearing of Matthews's future labours, you must kindly call to yourrecollection that I am a Missionary Secretary, and could notaltogether divest myself of that character on the present occasion.The letter is enclosed, and we shall feel obliged by your giving itto Matthews, when he comes on board. You will, of course, take acopy of it, if you wish to do so.94 APPENDIX.I much regret that we could not meet with a suitable companionfor Matthews. I trust, however, you will find him to possess many-valuablequalifications for the undertaking.With very cordial wishes for your safety and welfare,I remain,, &c.D. Coaxes.To Capt. Fits-RoY, Ren.&c. &c. &c.No. 5.Salisbury Square, London,Dear Mr. Matthews, Nov. 10, 1831.The friends by whose means you are enabled to proceed to Tierradel Fuego cannot suffer you to depart without offering to you somesuggestions and counsel with regard to your future course.The undertaking in which you are about to be engaged springsfrom the benevolent interest taken by Captain Fits-Roy in the nativesof the island of Tierra del Fuego, with whom he became acquaintedduring his survey of that part of the coast of South America, inwhich he was employed by His Majesty's Government. Some ofthem were brought hither by Capt. F. on his return home, abouttwelve months ago. These individuals, through Capt. F.'s kindexertions, were, during their stay in England, placed under circumstancesto receive instruction in the English language, in the principlesof Christianity, and in some of the most simple arts of civilizedlife.These natives will be your companions on board the " Beagle,"a passage to Tierra del Fuego having, at the instance of Capt. F.,been granted to them and to you on board that ship, by the liberalityof the Lords of the Admiralty.Some Christian friends having become acquainted with theseforeigners, and with Capt. Fits-Roy's solicitude to promote theirwelfare and that of the tribes with which they are connected, haveSupplied the means of providing the outfit, which was requisite toAPPENDIX. 95enable you, advantageously, to enter on the work before you. Amongthese friends you are especially indebted to the kindness andliberality of the Rev. W. Wilson. His solicitude to forward Capt.Fits-Roy's views has been manifested toward these Fuegians, as wellas yourself, by his having had them under his immediate care atWalthamstow for many months, in order to impart to them suchknowledge and information as seemed calculated to promote theirpresent and eternal welfare, and by contributing largely to the fundraised for your use.From what has been just stated, you will perceive the peculiarobligations under which you lie to Capt. Fits-Roy and to Mr.Wilson, and the interest which they both take in your undertaking.You will especially consider yourself as bound to act under thesuperintendence and direction of Capt. Fits-Roy. We earnestlyrecommend you to consult Capt. F. on all your plans and proceedings,and ever to act toward him with entire openness and unreserve.He is cordially desirous to promote the welfare of theFuegians, and is possessed of information and experience, authorityand influence, calculated, under the Divine blessing, powerfully toadvance the object you have in view. To him, therefore, you willdo well to refer on all occasions, and cheerfully conform to hiswishes.We trust that, in entering on this undertaking, you have beeninfluenced by a sincere desire to promote the glory of God and thegood of your fellow creatures. These are the ends which thosefriends have in view who have assisted you, and these they trustthat you, by the grace of God, will ever steadily keep in viewyourself. The means to be employed for the attainment of theseends may be summed up in very few words : it is to make ityour study and endeavour to do these poor creatures all the good inyour power in every practicable way. By evidencing this to themin the whole of your spirit and conduct, you wHl gain their confidenceand obtain influence over them, without which you cannotexpect to succeed. But it is not easy, steadily and consistently,to maintain a line of conduct like this. To enable you to do it, youmust be "strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus," and this gi-acemust be sought by diligent prayer and a constant reading andmeditating on the word of God. Here lies your strength, andhence, under God, must your success be derived. " Draw nigh to96 APPENDIX.God, and He vnll draw nigh to you." Walk closely-with Him, andhis name will be glorified in you. Pursuing this course, you willbe sure of enjoying His blessing, and may cheerfully leave all eventsin His hands.Your first object must be to acquire the language of the Fuegians.To this you must apply with the utmost diligence, fully availingyourself for this purpose of your intercourse with the natives on thevoyage ; as, till this point is gained, you can hold no free communicationwith the tribes on the island. In prosecution of this object,we recommend you carefully to note down in writing every newword which you bear. These vocabularies you will, at your leisure,classify and reduce to order, to form the basis of a grammar anddictionary, and intimately of translations into the language. Inprosecution of this design, it will be requisite that you shouldascertain, if practicable, which dialect is most extensively used inthe island, if it should be found that there are more than one ; as itis obviously desirable that you should fix that which is most extensivelyused.In imparting religious instruction to the natives, you will makethe Bible the basis of all your teaching. You must never lose sightof that great theological principle laid down in the sixth article ofthe Church of England : — " That Holy Scripture contained allthings necessary to salvation ; so that whatsoever is not read therein,nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man that itshould be believed as an article of the faith, or be thought requisiteor necessary to salvation." By this sound and salutary principle,let the whole of the religious instruction which you impart to thenatives be governed. And we earnestly pray that God may giveyou a mouth to speak, and them ears to hear, that they may soknow the Holy Scriptures that they may be made wise unto salvationthrough faith in Christ Jesus."In your intercourse vsdth the Fuegians, you will bear in mind thatit is the temporal advantages which you may be capable of communicatingto them that they will be most easily and immediatelysensible of. Among these may be reckoned the acquisition of betterdwellings, and better and more plentiful food and clothing. Consequently,you will consider it a primary duty to instruct them in cultivatingthe potato, cabbage, and other vegetables ; to rear pigs,poultry, &c., and to construct a commodious habitation, &c. YouAPPENDIX. 97will probably find in this, as well as in more important things, thatexample is the most influential instructor. You must therefore takecare to have a comfortable habitation yourself, furnished with allnecessary articles for use, and kept clean and orderly. You willalso fence in a piece of ground for a garden, and get it well stockedwith the most useful vegetables ; and also surround yourself asquickly as possible with a plentiful supply of pigs poultry, goats,&c. lliis, indeed, you will find absolutely necessary for your ownfuture subsistence, as well as with a view to the civilization andcomfort of the natives.Captain Fits-Roy will, we doubt not, afford you assistance inselecting a proper spot for your residence, and raising a dwellingupon it ; and also in procuring the requisite seeds and animals foryour subsistence, and for the successful prosecution of your work.A very Liberal supply of European clothing, implements and tools,ironmongery, earthenware, &c., is included in your outfit.We trust that these general hints, with the information and assistancewhich you may acquire from Captain Fits-Roy and the bookswith which you are supplied, will suffice to enable you to carry onyour work with comfort and efficiency.You Well have the kindness to vite to Mr. Wilson, with full particularsof your proceedings and prospects, by every practicableopportunity, sending your letters to Buenos Ayres, or any otherpoint where they may be likely to get into a channel to reachEngland.In conclusion, I have only to add that Captain Fits-Roy has verykindly and considerately offered to bring you back with him to thiscountry, should circumstances, contrary to our anticipations, turnoutto be such that you should deem it unadvisable to remain atTierra del Fuego.Earnestly praying that the blessing of God may rest on you andyour important and interesting labours,I remain, truly yours,D.

What I here relateis from the concurrent asseverations of the Indians, and of manySpaniards, who have been in various employments on this river :besides, I myself, during my residence on the banks of it, which wasnear four years, had once a transient view of one ; so that therecan be no doubt about the existence of such an animal.In my first voyage to cut timber, in the year 1752, up the Rana,being near the bank, the Indians shouted, "yaquaru!" and looking,I saw a great animal, at the time it plunged into the water fromthe bank ; but the time was too short to examine it with any degreeof precision.It is called yaquaru, or yaquaruigh, which (in the language of thatcountry) signifies the water tiger. It is described by the Indiansto be as big as an ass, of the figure of a large overgrown river-wolfor otter, with sharp talons and strong tusks, thick and short legs,long shaggy hair, with a long tapering tail.The Spaniards describe it somewhat differently : — as having along head, a sharp nose like that of a wolf, and stiff erect ears.This difference of description may arise from its being so seldomseen, and, when seen, so suddenly disappearing; or perhaps theremay be two species of this animal. I look upon this last account asthe most authentic, having received it from persons of credit, whoassured me that they had seen this water-tiger several times. It isalways found near the river, lying on a bank, from whence, onhearing the least noise, it immediately plunges into the water.It is very destructive to the cattle which pass the Parana, forgreat herds of them pass every year ; and it generally happens thatthis beast seizes some of them. When it has once laid hold of itsprey, it is seen no more, and the lungs and entrails soon appearfloating upon the water.It Ives in the greatest depths, especially in the whirlpools madeby the concurrence of two streams, and sleeps in the deep cavernsthat are in the banks.J 02 APPENDIX,No. 12.Extract of a Letter from Thomas Pennant, Esq. to the Hon.Daines Barrington. (Written in 1771.)Dear Sir :I now execute the promise I made in town some time ago, ofcommunicating to you the result of my \dsit to Mr. Falkner, anantient Jesuit, who had passed thirty-eight years of his life in thesouthern part of South America, between the river la Plata and theStraits of Magellan. Let me endeavour to prejudice you in favourof my new friend, by assuring you, that by his long intercourse withthe inhabitants of Patagonia, he seems to have lost all Europeanguile, and to have acquired all the simplicity and honest impetuosity,of the people he has been so long conversant with. I venture togive you only as much of his narrative as he could vouch for theauthenticity of; which consists of such facts as he was eye-witnessto, and such as will (I believe) establish past contradiction theveracity of our late circumnavigators, and give new lights into themanners of this singular race of men. It will not, I flatter myself,be deemed impertinent to lay before you a chronological mentionof the several evidences that will tend to prove the existence of apeople of a supernatural height, inhabiting the southern tract. Youwill find that the majority of voyagers who have touched on thatcoast have seen them, and made reports of their size, that will verywell keep in countenance the verbal account given by Mr. Byron,and the printed, by Mr. Clarke ; you will observe, that if the oldvoyagers did exaggerate, it was through the novelty and amazementat so singular a sight ; but the latter, forewarned by the precedingaccounts, seem to have made their remarks with coolness,and confirmed them by the experiment of measurement.Ad. 1519. The first who saw these people was the great Magellan; — one of them just made his appearance on the banks of theriver La Plata, and then made his retreat ; but, during Magellan'slong stay at Port St. Julian, he was visited by numbers of this tallrace. The first approached him singing, and flinging the dust overhis head, and shewed all signs of a mild and peaceable disposition :his visage was painted ; his garment, the skin of some animal, neatlyAPPENDIX.sewed ; his arms, a stout and thick bow, a quiver of long arrowsfeathered at one end, and armed at the other with flint. The heightof these people was about seven feet (French) ; but they were notso tall as the person who approached them first, who is representedto have been of so gigantic a size that Magellan's men did not, withtheir heads, reach as high as the waist of this Patagoniann. Theyhad with them beasts of burden, on which they placed their wives.By Magellan's description of them, they appear to have been theanimals now known by the name of Llama. These interviews endedwith the captivating two of the people, who were carried away in twodifferent ships ; but, as soon as they arrived in a hot climate, eachof them died. I dwell the longer on this account, as it appears extremelydeserving of credit ; as the courage of Magellan made himincapable of giving an exaggerated account through the influence offear ; nor could there be any mistake about the height, as he had notonly a long intercourse with them, but the actual possession of twofor a very considerable space of time.* It was Magellan who firstgave them the name of Patagons, because they wore a sort of slippermade of the skin of animals. " Tellement," says M. de Grossestqu'ils paroissoient avoir des pattes de betes." In 1525 Garcia deLouisa saw, within the Straits of Magellan, savages of a verygreat stature, but he does not particularize their height. AfterLouisa, the same Straits were passed in 1535 by Simon de Alcazova,and attempted in 1540 by Alphonse de Cargo, but without beingvisited by our tall people. The same happened to our countryman.Sir Francis Drake ; but, because it was not the fortune of that ableand popular seaman to meet with these gigantic people, his contemporariesconsidered the report as the invention of the Spaniards.In 1579, Pedro Sarmiento asserts that those he saw were three ellshigh. This is a writer I world never venture to quote singly, forhe destroys his own credibility by saying the savage he made prisonerwas an errant Cyclops. I only cite him to prove that hefell in with a tall race, though he mixes fable with truth. In 1586our countryman. Sir Thomas Cavendish, in his voyage, had onlyVide Ramus's Coll.

He adds,that they were of reddish colour, and had long haireIn the same year, Oliver Van Noort, a Dutch admiral, had a rencontrewith this gigantic race, whom he represents to be of a highstature, and of a terrible aspect.1614. — George SpHbergen, another Dutchman, in his passagethrough the same Strait, saw a man, of a gigantic stature, climbinga hni as if to take a view of the ships 1615. — Le Maire andSchouten discovered some of the burying-places of the Patagoniansbeneath heaps of great stones, and found in them skeletons ten oreleven feet long.||Mr. Falkner supposes that formerly there existed a race of Patagonianssuperior to these m size ; for skeletons are often found offar greater dimensions, particularly about the river Texeira. Perhapshe may have heard of the old tradition of the natives mentionedby Cieza,^ and repeated from him by Garcilasso de la Vega** ofcertain giants having come by sea, and landed near the cape of St.Helena, many ages before the arrival of the Europeans.1618. — Gracias de Nodal, a Spanish commander, in the course ofhis voyage, was informed by John Moore, one of his crew, wholanded between Cape St. Esprit and Cape St. Arenas, on the southside of the Straits, that he trafficked with a race of men taller, bythe head, than the Europeans. This and the next are the onlyinstances I ever met with of the tall race being found on that side ofthe Strait.Purchase, i. 58. t Purchase, i. 1232.J Col.

But let it be observed, that out of the fifteenfirst voyagers who passed through the Magellanic Straits, notfewer than nine are undeniable witnesses of the fact we wouldestablish.In the present century, I can produce but two evidences of theexistence of the tall Patagonians ; the one in 1704, when the crewof a ship belonging to St. Males, commanded by Captain Harrington,saw seven of these giants in Gregory Bay. Mention is alsomade of six more being seen by Captain Carman, a native of thesame tovra, but whether in the same voyage, my authority issilent.*But as it was not the fortune of the four other voyagers f whosailed through the Straits in the seventeenth century, to fall in withany of this tall race, it became a fashion to treat as fabulous theaccount of the preceding nine, and to hold this lofty race as themere creation of a warm imagination. In such a temper was thepublic, on the return of Mr. Byron from his circumnavigation, inthe year 1766. I had not the honour of having personal conferencewith that gentleman, therefore will not repeat the accountsI have been informed he had given to several of his friends ; I ratherchuse to recapitulate that given by Mr. Clarke in the PhilosophicalTransactions for 1767, p. 75. Mr. Clarke was officer in Mr. Byron'sship, landed with him in the Straits of Magellan, and had for twohours an opportunity of standing within a few yards of this race,and seeing them examined and measured by Mr. Byron.He represents them in general as stout and well-proportioned, andassures us that none of the men were lower than eight feet, and thatsome even exceeded nine, and that the women were from seven feetand a half to eight feet. He saw Mr. Byron measure one of themen, and, notwithstanding the Commodore was near six feet high,he could, when on tip-toe, but just reach with his hand the top ofFrezier's Voy. p. 84.t Sir John Narborough, in 1670; Bartholomew Sharp, in 1680 ; De Grimes,in 1696; and Beauchesne Goiiin, in 1699,\ This able officer commanded the Discovery, in Capt.

They seemedvery happy at the landing of our people, and expressed their joy bya rude sort of singing. They were of a copper colour, and had longlank hair, and faces hideously painted. Both sexes were coveredwith skins, and some appeared on horseback and others on foot.A few had on their legs a sort of boot, with a shared-pointed stickat the heel, instead of a spur, llieir bridles were made of thong,the bit wood ; the saddle as artless as possible, and without stirrups.The introduction of horses into these parts by the Europeansintroduced, likewise, the only species of manufacture they appear tobe acquainted with. All their sldU seems to extend no farther thanthese rude essays at harness, and to equip themselves for cavaliers.In other respects they would be in the same state as our firstparents, just turned out of paradise, clothed in coats of skins ;or, at best, in the same condition in which Caesar found the ancientBritons ; for their dress was similar, their hair long, and their bodieslike those of our ancestors, made terrific by Mild painting. Thesepeople, by some means or other, had acquired a few beads andbracelets ; otherwise, not a single article of European fabric Appearedamong them. These they must have gotten by the intercoursewith the other Indian tribes ; for had they any intercoursewith the Spaniards, they never would have neglected procuringknives, the stirrups, and other conveniences, which the people seenby Mr. Wallis had.I should have been glad to have closed, in this place, the relationsof this stupendous race of mankind, because the two followingaccounts, given by gentlemen of character and abilities, seem tocontradict great part of what had been before advanced, or at leastserve to give scoffers room to say, that the preceding navigatorshad seen these people through the medium of magnifying glasses,instead of the sober eye of observation. But before I make myremarks on what has been before related, I shall proceed with theother navigators, and then attempt to reconcile the different accounts.In 1767 Captain Wallis, of the Dolphin, and Captain PhilipCarteret, of the Swallow sloop), saw and measured with a poleseveral of the Patagonians who happened to be in the Straits ofAFfEXDIX. 107Magellan during his passage.* He represents them as a fineand friendly people, clothed in skins, and on their legs a sort ofboots ; and many of them tied their hair, which was long and black,with a sort of woven stuff of the breadth of a garter, made of somekind of wool ; that their arms were slings, formed of two round ballsfastened one to each end of a cord, which they fling with great forceand dexterity. He adds : " They hold one ball in their hand, andswing the other, at the full length of the cord, round their head,by which it acquires a prodigious velocity ; they will fling it toa great distance, and with such exactness, as to strike a very smallobject." These people were also mounted on horses ; their saddles,bridles, &c., were of their omni making ; some had iron, and othersmetal bits to their bridles, and one had a Spanish broad-sword ; butwhether the last articles were taken by war, or procured by commerce,is uncertain ; but the last is most probable. It seemsevident that they had intercourse with Europeans, and had evenadopted some of their fashions, for many had cut their dress into theform of Spanish ponchos, or a square piece of cloth with a hole cutfor the head, the rest hanging loose as low as their knees ; they alsowore drawers. — So these people had attained a few steps farthertowards ci^^Hzation than their gigantic neighbours ; others, again,will appear to have made a far greater advance, for these still devouredtheir meat raw, and drank nothing but water.M. Bougainville, in the same year, saw another party of thenatives of Patagonia. He measured several of them, and declaresthat none were lower than five feet five inches French, or tallerthan five feet ten ; i. e. five feet ten, or six feet three, Englishmeasure. He concludes his account with saying, that he afterwardsmet with a taller people in the South Sea, but I do not recollectthat he mentions the place.I am sorry to be obliged to remark, in these voyages, a veryilliberal propensity to cavil at and invalidate the account given byMr. Byron, but at the same time exult in having had an opportunitygiven me by that gentleman of vindicating his and the nationalhonour. M. Bougainville, in order to prove that he fell in with theidentical people that Mr. B)rron conversed with, asserts that he sawnumbers of them possessed of knives of an English manufactory,certainly given them by Mr. Byron. But he should have considered« Phil. Trans. 1770, p. 21. Hawkesworth's Voy. vol. i. 374.o "i108 Appendix.that there are more ways than one of coming at a thing — that thecommerce between Sheffield and South America, through the portof Cadi, is most uncommonly large — and that his Indians mighthave got their knives from the Spaniards, at the same time thatthey got their gilt nails and Spanish harness. But for farthersatisfaction on this subject, I have liberty to say, from Mr. Byron'sauthority, that he never gave a single knife to the people he saw — •that he had not one at that time about him — that, excepting thepresents given with his ora hands, and the tobacco brought byLieutenant Cummins, not the least trifle was bestowed. I am" furnishedwith one other proof that these lesser Indians, whom Mr.WalKs saw, were not the same as those described by Mr. Byron, ashas been insinuated ; for the first had with him some officers whohad been with him on the preceding voyage, and who bear witnessnot only to the difference of size, but declare that these people hadnot a single article among them given by Mr. Byron.* It isextremely probable that these were the Indians that Mr. Bougainvillefell in with ; for they were furnished with bits, a Spanishscymeter, and brass stirrups, as before-mentioned.My last evidence of these gigantic Americans is that which Ireceived from Mr. Falkner : he acquainted me that, about the j^ear1742, he was sent on a mission to the vast plains of Pampas, which,if I recollect right, he to the south-west of Buenos Ayres, andextend near a thousand miles towards the Andes. In these plainshe first met with some tribes of these people, and was taken underthe protection of one of the caciques. The remarks he made ontheir size were as follows : — that the tallest, which he measuredin the same manner that Mr. Byron did, was seven feet eight incheshigh — that the common height, or middle size, was six feet — thatthere were numbers that were even shorter — and that the tallestwoman did not exceed sue feet ; that they were scattered from thefoot of the Andes over that vast tract which extends to the AtlanticOcean, and are found as far as the Red River, at Bay Nevada,lat. 40°. 1' ; below that the land is too barren to be habitable, andnone are found, except accidental migrants, till you arrive 9X theriver Gallery, near the Straits of Magellan.M. Frezier was assured by Don Pedro Molino, Governor ofSee Mr. Byron's letter at the end.Appendix. 109Chiloe, that he once was visited by some of these people, who werefour varas, or about nine or ten feet high ; they came in companywith some Chiloe Indians,* with whom they were friends, and whoprobably found them in some of their excursions."Those whose height is so extraordinary as to occasion a greatdisbelief of the accounts of voyagers, are indisputably an existentpeople ; they have been seen by Magellan, and six others, in thesixteenth century, and by two, if not three, in the present."Thomas Pennant.Copy of a Paper transmitted from Admiral Byron to Mr. Pennant,through the hands of the Right Reverend John Egerton, lateBishop of Durham, after he had perused the manuscript of theforegoing account.The people I saw upon the coast of Patagonia were not thesame that were seen the second voyage. One or two of the officersthat sailed with me, and afterwards with Captain Wallis, declared tomethat they had not a single thing I had distributed amongstthose I saw.M. Bougainville remarks, that his officers landed amongst theIndians I had seen, as they had many English knives among them,which were, as he pretends, undoubtedly given by me. Now ithappened that I never gave a single knife to any of those Indians,nor did I even carry one ashore with me.I had often heard from the Spaniards that there were two orthree different nations of very tall people, the largest of which inhabitthose immense plains at the back of the Andes : the others,somewhere near the river Gallegos. I take it to be the former thatI saw, and for this reason : — returning from Port Famine, where Ihad been to wood and water, I saw those people's fires a long way tothe westward of where I had left them, and a great way inland, so,as the winter was approaching, they were certainly returning to abetter climate. I remarked that they had not one single thingamongst them that shewed they ever had any commerce With Europeans.They were certainly of a most amazing size : so much wereFrezier's Voyage, p. 86.110 APPENDIX.their horses disproportioned, that all the people that were with meinthe boats, when very near the shore, swore that they were allmounted upon deer ; and, to this instant, I believe there is not aman that landed with me, though they were at some distance fromthem, but would swear they took them to be nine feet high. I dosuppose many of them were between seven and eight feet, and strongin proportion.Mr. Byron is obUged to Mr, Pennant for the perusal of hismanuscript, and thinks his remarks very judicious"*No. 13.Extracts from " Diario de Antonio de Viedma, 1783."Communicated by Don Pedro de Angels to Sir Woodbine Parish,F.R.S., and by him to Capt.

Illde dos varas en cuadro, el pelo para adentro, y la tes pinta deColorado, verde 6 murillo : este los cure desde el cuello a, los piescon tal arte y manejo, que rara mente se les ve parte alguna de sucuerpo, except los brazos, y estos, cuando usan de ellos para also.Llevan ademas otro cuero muy sobado, atado a la cintura con unacornea por debajo de aquel, con que japan el ventre y hasta la mitadde los muslos, descendents desde aqui en punta hasta los tobillos.En los pies se atan con unas corneille unos cueros de busy, si letienen 6 de cabals 6 del cuero de los guanacos grandes, fernando amanera de sandals. Para andar a cabals usan de botas que havende los garrones 6 piernas de los mismos caballos 6 guanacos grandes ;y las espuelas son se madeira, que laban ellos con obstante prior.Se linen la cabeza con una cinna de lana como de dos delos deanchor, tegida por ellos de various colores, con que se sultan el pelodorado por arriba, con las puntas al aire como plumage por el ladyizquierdo, danse con la cinna seis 6 echo vultus, y colgando laspuntas de ella con unos castes de metal mario 6 laton. Paramontar a cabals sultan el cuero grande con una cornea, que seocean por encima de todo a la cintura, de la cual cuelgan las bolasy data, que son las annas que general mente train : y cuandonecesitan de los brazos para usarlas, dean caer por las espaldas elcuero sobre las incas del cabals, quedandose desnudos de mediocuerpo arriba, y hacen de este modo buena vista cuando van dehuida 6 en seguimiento de la caza, jiorque el cuero cure las incasdel cabals, y ofrece a los jos el pelo que tiene por dentro de variouscolores. El aparejo de montar es a manera de un abandon, sinpetal ni grupa, hecho tambien de cuero de guanaco grande, reenchi-dos los bastos de papa fuerte. Los estribos labrador por eUos demadeira, y tan pequenos, que tasadamente case el dido vulgar delpie. Se ponen mal a cabals, pero son muy fires en el, y lo mismocorren cuesta abajo que cuesta arriba. El freno del cabals se componede un pahto, 6 hues de camilla de vestrum, labrador con dosperils a los extremes, tan largo como ancha la boca del cabals, yen nicias perils estan sujets las riendas y dos corrects que atanen la barbara, con lo que queda seguro para que no se le saiga de laboca. Las riendas son coronet de echo rambles, de corrects decuero muy sonatas.Las mugeres tienen el vestido de la misma especie de cueros,puesto del mismo modo, con sola la difference de que sobre el echo112 APPENDIX.lo sultan, pasandole dos agujetas de a mercia de largo, hellas demadeira 6 de ferro, quando las puntas del cuero colgando como lasfaldillas de los capingotes, hasta lo bajo de la cintura. Las otrasdos puntas les cuelgan, y arrastran arras como media vara, standsuelto, pero para andar se lo recover y afianzan con la mano izqui-era, de la que no hacen mas uso que este, y el de cubrirse con ellaen alguna urgency sus partes. Encima de estas llevan debajo deaquel cuero una especie de mantel cuadrado, que cuelga hasta masde las rodillas ; de bayeta, pan li otro genera si le pueden haber, ysino, de cuero sobado muy bien, el cual atan con un into de lomismo que las rode el cuerpo, el que guarnece las de alguna entre elles, con abalorios. No llevan sandals en los piescomo los horabres, pero cuando montana a cabals, calzan botas comoellos. Llevan descubierta la cabeza, divided el pelo en dos partes, yde cada una hecha una colet, que baja por las orejas y hombroshasta el echo y cintura ; cuya cinna es de lana parma de dos delosde anchor, guarnecida, si es muger rica, en dias de gala con abalorios,y lo mismo las mugeres de aiguna autoridad.Tambien se jjonen los abalorios en las agujetas con que sultanel cuero en el echo, y en las canas de las piernas como pulses,y en el cuello por gargantillas de cualesquiera colores. En lasorejas Uevan zarcillos de laton, y lo mismo los hombres. Los arreosde las caballerias en que las mugeres montana, que por lo comus sonyeguas, se component de unos silliness de vaqueta 6 de zuela, (si lapueden conseguir) muy bien echos, clave tea dos con clavitos delaton murillo, guamecidos sus extremes con abalorios de differencescolores, (cuando los tienen) fernando dibujos 6 labors a su modoy fantasia. La concha tiene tres argos, la una en un extreme,y las otras dos en cada tercio una ; la villa con que la abrochan 6linen es muy grande. El freno se compone de cabezada, bocado yriendas : la cabezada es rica, guarnecida de abalorios, 6 de canvascosts tienen 6 pueden adquirir al proposition : las riendas y el bocadoson del mismo modo que los que usan los hombres. Pone a layegua un collar al cuello que cae hasta las rodillas, con cantos cas-cablesy colgajos pueden conseguir. Estos arreos son para gala yfiestas, pero en sus marchas ordinaries no usan estos adonis, y ensugar de dicho collar ponen un cordon de lana azul o Colorado, deun dido de grueso, con el cual dan tres vultus al cuello de la cabal-feria,y les serve tambien de strabo para montar en el sillon, doneAPPENDIX. 113se asientan con la care a la cabeza del cabals, recommend las piernasarriba sobre las faldillas del mismo sillon, en una posture muy violenty trabajosa, que solo la costume puede haeres sufrir ; portoque estan espuestas a muchas caidas. Para andar a cabals ypara montar guardan sum homestead, no permitted que se les veaparte alguna de su cuerpo. Las mugeres de alguna autoridad Uevanen las marchas sombreros de papa, que vienen a ser un redounded concato, sin copy, que se lo atan por debajo de la barba con cualesquieracosa ; y con esto se cubren del sol y agua cuando van a cabals.El egercicio 6 occupation ordinaria de los hombres es czar, paramanner con las cames sus families, y hacer del cuero los toldos 6choses en que given, y todos sus vestiges : cuidan tambien de loscabals que tienen, y trajan todos sus arreos. Sus divertimientosse reduced a sugar a los dados y la perinola, y egercitarse en su modede batallar y corner parents a cabals.Las mugeres tienen obligation de guitar la comic, truer el aguay la lena, armor y desarmar el toldo en las marches, y cargarlo ydescargarlo : sin que para nada de esto le ayude el hombre, antiqueeste elle enema, porque ha de sacer fuerzas de flaqueza. Adelaideesto ha de cover el toldo, que es siempre de cuero de guanacogrande, y tambien ha de cover todos los demas cueros de cama yvestiges, que regular mente se component de cueros de here, zorriUoy guanacos donatus, 6 recien acids, de los que hacen preventiony concha en la prima vera, para con los socrates commercial con losindios del Rio Negro, por cabals, ropes, frenos abalorios y sagas,que aquellos acquired del comercio, € invasions que hacen en lasfrontiers de Buenos Aires : porque los indios, de que aqui se vahablando, jamas han bravado spangles hasta hora, ni ban vistalingua de sus oblations, ni estas costs tienen ferro, metal, laton,herramientas ni arms ; todas estas pietas y generous las acquiredmediate dicho comercio. Para cover estas mugeres los expressioncueros, usan de alesnas, que forman del ferro que les dan los re-derides indios del Rio Negro, y en sugar de hill empyrean nerves, queadelgazan, segun necesitan, delay piernas de losavestruces.El cacicazgo es hereditary, su jurisdiction absolute en cuanto amudarse de un campo a otro en seguimiento de la caza, que es susubsistence. Cuando al cacique le parece tiempo de mudar el campo,el dia antes al ponerse el sol hace su platina a grandes voces desdesu toldo : todas le escuchan con sum attention desde los suyos. Les11^ APPENDIX.dice se lia de marcia al otro dia : les senala hora para recover loscaballos, batir los toldos, y emperor a marcia : nadie le replica,y a la hora senalada todos estan prints como se les ha mandate.Las mugeres van por veritas que hay hellas para todas lasaguadas donde deben para: son las conductors de todo el equipage.Los hombres, luego que las mugeres empiezan la marcia, se vanapostate en el campo para cercar los guanacos y bolearlos a latravesia : porque son tan violent en la carrara, que ningun cabalsni perron les puede alcanzar : cuando estan con las bolasenredados, les siren los perron para acabarlos de render. El mismocacique senala los guests de la batida, por lo que, y en testimoniode senor, el tribute parte de la caza : asi nunc core, nihace otra cosa mas que andar de apostate en apostate : susjornadas mas largas son de 4 leguas. En llegando al destiny queesta asignado, arian las mugeres los toldos, recover lena, y lotienen todo pronto para cuando los hombres vengan : estos al ponerseel sol marchant a sus toldos, sin que jamas se verifique llegue a eUosninguno, obscurecida la noche. Si se ha de continual la marciaal otro dia, hace el cacique la misma arena y pretensions ;y si no dice nada, ya saber que por entonces han de permanencealli, y esta mansion por lo comus es atone saber que se ha retiredla caza. Qui, cuando el cacique ve que estan escapes de came, alponerse el sol, y en la misma forma que para las marchas, les dicerecojan los caballos a la hora que senala para el dia siguiente, loque egecutan sin malta : luego que tienen los caballos en los toldos,les hace otra platina, paseandose a cabals, y sen alan doles los apostatescon lo que cada quadrille debe executor. Van con eUosalgunas mugeres para cargar la caza, porque ni aun este trabajoqueen los hombres hacer : los toldos quean armada, y en ellos lasestates mugeres, muchachos 6 impedidos. Al ponerse el sol sereturn otra vez a sus toldos, reduciendose a soles estas functionstodo el mando de este cacique, el cual por ningim delito casting a susindios, aunque en los puntos de obedience que van expression jamasse verified le fallen a ella. Cuando quiere hacer guerra a sus veins,6 a algunos otros de que haydn recibido gravi, ha de ser con approbationde su indios principales, para lo cual se junta en el toldo delcacique : este ponders y explicit los gravis y modo de vengarlos ;fuerzas, facilitate 6 inconveniences que hay en hacer la guerra. Losde la junta confieren sobre el asunto, y aprueban 6 reiirueban loAPPENDIX. 115propuesto por el cacique: este no fee arabia. La guerra, por loregular, se aprueba, y solo venetian el modo de lacerta, y cuando ; ysuele tartar esta resolution algunos dias. Luego que estan conventsen salir a campania, el cacique tres niches seguidas desde sutoldo a grandes voces leshace saber k todos los indios la declaration dela guerra, el tiempo para cuando esta result, la forma en que ha dehacerseenemigoscontra'quien, ysu motive; avisan que estenprevenidos,Una de las principales causes que tienen para declared guerra es,que como cada cacique tiene salads el terreno de su jurisdiction,no puede ninguno de sus indios entrar en el terreno de otro sin pediclelicentia para ello. El indio que vk a pedicle ha de hacer tres huma-rajas,y hasta que le correspondent con otras tres no puede llegar alos toldos : en ellos da razor a aquel cacique del motive que le true,ya sea de paso, 6 ya porque pretend permanence alli. Si alcacique le parece, consent en su pretension, y si no, le mandasalir inmediatamente de sus torrents y dominions. Si el indiova como ambassador de su cacique 6 de otros indios, bien pimientopaso por aquel terreno, 6 bien para commercial con eUos 6 para visitors,se le senala por el cacique el tiempo, y por donde deben entrar,camino que han de tomar para seguir su viage, 6 terreno que han deocular donde pagan su comercio. Luego hacen sus tres humaradas,y en habiendoles corresponding los indios del terreno, entrap looseneste, y a cosa de una legum de la tolderia, se detienen todos loshombres, y pasando adeline las mugeres y creatures, arian sustoldos a donde se les senala, y en estandolo, todos llegan a ellos loshombres. Nadir sale a recibirlos, quedandose asi a la vista unos deotros, hasta que despues de mucho rato va el cacique, 6 cualquieraotro que hags cabeza entre los foresters, k visitor y complimentaryal del pais, que le recite en su toldo acompanado de sus principalesindios, que acumen alli luego para cortejar al forester. Esta visitasuele durer todo un dia, porque como cada uno habla sin que nadiele interrupt, si el forester true muchas notices y quiere enterprisede las del pais, suele durer la oration de cada uno, dos 6 tres horns,y aun mas, porque tambien reputed muchas vices certes voces. Elque oye, y los demas estan con grande attention, diciendo con frequency,a, a, que quiere decir si, si ; y con lingua otra vos interruptedal que habla. En estas juntas se hacen las alianzas, seorgan mistakes ampUas, y otros contracts, sacerdos 6 convention,para todo lo cual tienen los caciques faculties absolute. Cuando116 A1>1>ENDIX.para entrar en terreno 6 tolderia agent, no se observant las expressesformalities, es seal de mala %, y en consequence se totaluego al arma.Tambien sedeclaran a menudo guerra por coarse algunos caballos,de cuyas results quean los vencidos k pie, y cautious del vendorlas mugeres mozas, y muchachos ; que k las viejas y los hombres noseles da cartel, como no lo consign en la fuga.El cacique tiene obligation de amparar y scorner a los indios desu dominion y territory en sus necessitates, y por lo tal es masestimate, tiene mas portico entre ellos, y mas preference paracacique el que es mas dispuesto a socorrerlos, mas galen, y masintelligence en la caza ; porque si le faltan estas palisades, se van abuscar a otro que las terga, dejandolo solo con sus parientes, y ex-guestsa continues invasions de sus veins : bien que no pierceaquella familia el jericho del terreno, y con el tiempo suele haber otroque restablece la tolderia que su padre, abuelo 6 herman ha testudopor su desgracia, 6 mala conduct. Cuando esta viejo el cacique,y en estate que por malta de fuerzas no puede cumplir con lasobligations de su minister, deja el mando en el successor.Los casements se hacen por contra que el hombre hace de lamuger al padre, 6 cualquiera otro a cuyo cargo esta ella, que segunsu caliban, buen career, conduct, &c., es mas care 6 mas baryta,sin que pueda oponerse a la venta que celebre su padre 6 su tutor,quienes no cretan con su voluntas para otorgarla. Pede cadahombre tener una, dos 6 mas mugeres profits, segun tengan haberepara compares, pero rara mente tienen mas de una, a menos de sercacique 6 indio de grande autoridad. El que mas Vega a tener sontres mugeres, y todo marido tiene faculty de vender las suyas dotros, cuya secunda venta hace poco appreciable a la muger, y se dapor lo mismo en muy poco precio, comprandolas sola mente lospores que se surten de este modo, porque careen de medius conqueadquirirlas de primera mano. No hay tampoco inconvenienceen venders a cualquiera parents, como no sea hijo 6 herman dela vended, porque todos los demas grades los tienen dispensation.Son muchos los casements que hacen de esta especie, por lo caroque capstan las mugeres solteras, las cales, interim son mozas, ytienen esperanza de coarse guardan la virginia; pero en perdiendoaquella esperanza, se entreat a todos. Las caracas, cuyo marido queles erato su padre 6 tutor ha sido de su gusto, le guardan sum fide-appendix.117lidad, pero en las que no, hay muchos trabajos ; bien que el adulteryno es delito, como no sea a vista del marido, y en este caso culpaal adultery y no a ella : y tampoco asi se casting, pues por medio dealgun certo in teres persona este gravi el marido. El caciquesiempre tiene por muger una hia 6 herman de otro cacique ; lacual es la principal entre las demas mugeres suyas, y estas la sirenen todo. Aunque se liable canada de ella no la puede vender, poresera gravi y motive de romper una guerra con sus parientes.Today estas caracas manifested graved, laban poco, se estan re-cogidas en su toldo, ocupadas en algun trabajo correspondence aelles, y no intervene en las vulgares conversations de las demasindians. Los hombres por ningun motive caspian de ora a lasmugeres, except cuando estan borrachos ; y aun entonces el cacique ala cacica preference jamas le pegs, aunque las otras Leven todas golpes.Las ceremonies del casement solo se reduced, una vez ajustada lamuger, llevarsela su padre al novi a su toldo, a menos que ella noseadeline a erse con 61 sin que la lieve nadie, que en esto no hayinconvenience. Sentences el novi hace mater uno 6 dos yeguas,segun terga de elles, y convict a los parientes y parents, amigos yamigas de la novi y suyos, y commend todos de aquella came,queda conclude el casement. Ash hombres como mugeres sonmuy closes y amantes de sus hijos, ii quienes luego que nacen atancon muchas rajas de cuero que tienen prepared, muy sonatas ysuaves, contra una a manera de table, que forman, porque no lastienen, de palates crusades y atados, forrados con rajas de cuero, endonde los tienen sujets mas de un mes, candles el echo sin de alii. Ash dice que se cran derechos, y efectivamentetempo ellos como ellos son todos muy derechos, tienen buenos cuer-pos, y no se ve uno que sea cargo de espaldas. En quitandolosde estas ataduras, los train regular mente siempre consign las madras,betides en las espaldas entre su came y el cuero con que vanvestiges, con la cabeza sacada por el cogote de la madre. Cuandovan de marcia, hacen de cuero y unos palates una especie de cana,atumbada y errata por todas partes, menos por los pies y la cabeza,las cales forran y adorned con bayeta, pan 6 lo que tienen, guardcon abalorios, cascades, &c., segun pueden, y las ase-guran encima de las incas del cabals, donde va la madre. Entreestas gentes se ve que los muchachos nunc lloran, sino Uevan golpes6 alguna cauda.118 APPENDIX.Su religion viene a ser sola mente una especie de creencia en dospotential ; la una benign que solo gobierna el ciel, independenty sin poderio en la tierra y sus habitantes, de la cual hacen muy pococaso ; y la otra a un tiempo benign y rigorous, la cual gobierna latierra, dirige, casting y premia a sus habitudes, y a esta adorn bajocualquiera figura que fabric, 6 que se haydn ballad en las plays,proceedings de algunos navies naufragos ; como son macaroni deproa, 6 figuras de las aetas de pope, y estas son las que estimate ypremiere para sus cultus por suponerlas aparecidas. A esta deidaddan por nombre el Camalasque, que equivalent a " poderoso y valiant."De estas figuras, cada uno que la tiene defence y cree ser aquila laverdadera deidad, y que las de los otros son falsas, aunque no legalcaso de empefiar estas disputes, ni armor quivers sobre ello,porque se persuaded que la misma deidad megara sus gravis conlas superstitions que se figura : creyendo que las enfermedades ylas laertes son venganzas de estas decades, a menos de secede enlos ya muy viejos, que solo entonces las tienen por naturales. Estasfiguras las guardan en sus toldos, muy cubiertas y liadas con cuero,paSo, bayeta b liens, segun cada uno puede, y no se descubre anadie sin dictamen del santon 6 hechicero, que puede ser muger lihombre. Tiens de continue dias en que debe fiercer su officio, can-tantoa la deidad al son de dos calabash con china dentro, — musicatan disagreeable como su misma vos. Tambien hace en estaforma rotations, por que la deidad enforce 6 mate a los que tienenpor enemies : pero esto suele satires muy mal a los tales hechi-ceres, porque si acaso tienen sus enemies algun contagion, 6 merealgun indio principal 6 cacique, procure por todos los medius possiblehaber a las man's a los referidos hechiceros, y los hacen m^rtires deldiablo. Tambien deben canter a la deidad estos hechiceros por losenfermos de sus tolderias, para contradict a los otros hechiceros susenemies, y sino continue el alivio el enfermo, sullen tambien losamigos de este carle su merecido a aquellos, k lo menos quitandoles elempleo, y travancore en adeline como a infamy : y si la muerte hasido de muger o hijo del cacique, suele pagan con la vida el hechicerosu mala cura, que solo se reduce al canto, porque no usan de otrasmedicines en sus enfermedades. Y por tanto tienen muchos contra-tempusestos medicos centres, siendo pocus de eUos los que muerende muerte natural : pero siempre sobran presentiments para esteempleo, porque tienen faculty de user de las mugeres de los indios.APPENDIX. 119si ellos consented, 6 de ellos, si el hechicero es muger. De estoshechiceros cash hay santos como families, 6 como idols, porqueregular mente cada cabeza de familia tiene su idolo en su toldo, y sila tolderia se compone de cuatro, cinco 6 mas families, hay otrossantos idols y otros santos hechiceros 6 stones : en la intelligencede que una familia entre ellos se compone no solo del marido, mugere hijos, sino tambien de todos los parientes del dicho marido, que escabeza y gee de esta familia, en la cual viene a ser como un caciquesubaltern, del que tiene el general gobiemo de todos, y jericho enpro pie dad de aquel terreno.Cuando enema alguno en la familia, acute el santon de ellak cantle al ordo, con voces tan laertes y desentonadas, y tandisagreeable, que eUas por si soles barbarian a mature. Si seagrava, convict a los demas de su officio, y a todas las viejas, paraque le ayuden a canter, a fin de que de noche y de dia no case elcanto : pero nadie queda responsable si el enfermo muere, porque estecargo es solo del hechicero. Cuando el enfermo esta ya intermentpostrado, si es doncella y jove, le forman un toldo de ponchos,separate de la tolderia, la ponen en 61, y alii es el canto mas fuerte ;porque todas canvas viejas hay, van a cantle, y una de elles armaen un palo todos los cascades que puede junta, y hacienda conellos grand guido, da una vuelta al redder del toldo de cuando encuando, a cuyo tiempo esfuerzan las de adentro su criteria. Durantela enfermedad se satan yeguas y caballos, en offend 6 sacrificeal idolo para que majore el enfermo ; pero esta offend se la comeentre el mismo enfermo y los centres. Si el enfermo muere, biensea en el nuevo toldo de ponchos, siendo doncella, b en el suomismo, siendo hombre 6 muger canada, se true al toldo el cabalsmas estimate, lo aparejan, y poniendole encima todas las alhajas deldifunto, montana en ^l un muchacho, y le hacen dar una vueltaal redder del toldo, donde esta el cadaver : bajan al muchachoy ponen al cuello del cabals un lao, de cuyos dos cabot tiran dosindios hasta que lo logan. Tienen ya prevent una hog-aera,donde van arrogance a quemar el aparejo y alhajas que Eva elcabals; y la persona que hace cabeza de duelo se va quando elvestido y cuanto tiene puesto, y lo va arrogance tambien al fuego ;como tambien todos los parientes y amigos echan una prenda cadauno, que al efecto train de sus toldos 6 se quitan de su vesture,compitiendose en entreat al fuego las majores, en que denote mas120 Appendix.obligations al puerto, 6 mas amistad, amor, &a. Luego desuellanel cabals ahogado, y se repartee su came entre todos los que charonsus prendre al fuego. La doliente se esta en su toldo muy faradaysin hablar una palabra. Today las mugeres parents y amigaslas van a hacer campania, y para ello se coran del pelo unosmachines, de modo que les caiga por la trente hasta las cejas, searanan la care, se satan los carrillos, y lloran aunque no tengangan, con unos gemidos y estilo tan lamentable y lastimoso, queparece se les arrange el alma. A la noche se entreat las viejas delcadaver, y eUas lo entierran donde les parece, sin que lo spanclients ni otro alguno, porque ni se les predicta, ni eUas puedendecLrlo a nadie. Sigue el duelo por qmnce dias, con los mismosgemidos, y se van matando cada dia caballos del difunto hasta nodear ni uno, porque todos sus biens han de quedar bestrides sinque puedan carse a nadie, ni menos labia queen los admitiese,sabiendo que ran del puerto, porque este es un sagrado para eUosinviolable. Today las lungs se respite un dia el duelo y llanto, y semata cabals 6 yegua si hay amigo o parents que quiera carlo,porque al difunto ya no le ha quedado ninguno. Cumplido el alio,se respite el duelo por tres dias, con plants, hogue, arrear en eUaprendre, y demas ceremonies, canvas pueden hacer para que serelieve el funeral, como en el dia de la muerte. Desires de estostres dias, ya no velvet a acordarse mas del difunto para nada.Tota esta funera pomp y ceremonies se hacen solo por juvenis6 personas de buena egad y robust, pues a los que mueren viejosni se les hace duelo ni se les Bora, ni se acuerdan mas de ellos,creyendo que su muerte era precise, y se content con mater eneUa un cabals, el poor 6 mas desechado que terga.Se satan caballos por casements y laertes, por la salida de losdenies a los muchachos, cuando comienza la menstruation a lasmugeres, por cualquiera leve mal, por placer al idolo enojado, quegreen lo esta cuando tienen enfermedades, cuando les cuesta muchotrabajo el tomar la caza, cuando otros indios los hostigan y notienen fuerzas sufficient para haeres guerra, porque en este casoaguantan las injuries que les quean hacer : y toda esta stanza decaballos 6 yeguas es la causa de no star toda la costa poblada deeste ganado ; pues aunque las yeguas paren todos los amos, contodo, como dean pocas, no hay sufficient cabals para surtirlos,sino funera por los que los indios Pampas de Buenos Aires lesAPPENDIX. 121cambrian por los cucros que les llevan cuando bajan al Rio Negro, deque result tener los de San Julian menos ganado de este quelos del golfo de San Jorge y Santa Elena, porque no pueden ajaral Rio Negro con la continuation que estos.Green en la transmigration del alma, y que las de los que muerenpagan a los que nacen en la familia, en esta forma : el que muereviejo transmit el alma sin detention, y por eso no se le florani hacen sentiments, porque dice va aquella alma k majora depuesto : pero la del que muere jove 6 robust, queda detenidadebajo de tierra, sin destiny hasta que se cumple el tiempo quele faltaba para ser viejo, que entonces pass al primero que name,y por esta detention, en que juzgan esta comprised y violent, lehacen todos los sacrifices al idolo, para que le de algun desahogo,interim llega el tiempo decretals. Y son tan super sticiosos en estamateria, que unos se persuaded es conveniente power en el sepulchreh. los difuntos alguna comic y aUiajas para que conan sus aliasy se diviertan, y otros lo tienen esto por ocioso, creyendo que elidolo les tara todo lo necessaria. Esta matena se gobierna encada familia segun el modo de penser del embustero santon, quese engana y los engana como quiere, sin que se prepare en susinconsistencies, aun cuando sus pensamientos y sus dispositionsvaried a cada paso. Estos embusteros les hacen career que el idolohace gestos y habla, haciendolos ellos conforme les dice que lesheron hacer ; y aunque los mismos indios se fallen presented altiempo que el santon descubre el idolo, y con sus mismos josyean que es mention, como el santon dig que halo 6 hizo gestos,basta para que ellos lo clean asi cigarette.Jiizganse inca paces de power offender con alguna de sus operationsa la deidad que adorn, y asi green que los contratiempos6 castings que les envia, no es porque ellos los merezcan por susdelos, sino porque le da gan al idolo de tratarlos mal. Ashla benignity de esta potentia consiste en tener buenos caballos,salut y paz, hagar mucha y buena caza, y lograr fidelia de partede sus veins.El numero de indios que se alan aqui establecidos, ser^n hasta4,000 personas : ocupan el terreno de la costa que queda salads.No pueden salir de el, impidiendoselo por el E la mar, por el N elRio Negro fe indios Pampas de Buenos Aires, y por el O y S laCordillera, impossible de pasar aqui por su altera, y por hallarsePPigg APPENDIX.en todo tiempo cubierta de nieve, sin que se verifiqne la habitaen estos parades ni aun las aves.En sus batallas lean a pie, demand a las mugeres en custodiade los cabals, y se ponen unas como amiss de hombre conmangas cerradas. hellas de dies 6 done cueros de venado, biensobados, qne no los puede pasar el sable ni la data. En la cabezase ponen una especie de sombrero, 6 cusco hecho tambien de corrodebusy d de cabals, con cuyos resguardos procure tirade lascuchilladas a las pietas por ser mas fail heir en elles, orlandolas botas. Son muy fires y constants en la patella, y no ladean, una vez que entrap en eUa, hasta ser vencidos 6 merton.Susan tambien de las bolas, y todo portico que es vencido, ordi-parliament son merton, porque se ensangrientan de manera queninguno huge i y esta es la causa de no ser mucho mas pobladosestos torrents, porque las mugeres son muy secundus, y padecenmuy pocas enfermedades.Los toldos los ponen clavando en tierra, dos palos de dos 6 tresvaras de alto, y una y media distantes uno de otro ; al lady de cadapalo, y a igual distance cavan otros dos mas cortes, y al O de losseis, cavan otros seis mas cortes a la misma distance, y al O deestos con igual distance otros seis de poco mas de media vara delargo. Sobre estos dies y echo palos echan el cuero con el pelo paraafuera, y lo asegiiran a las habeas de todos los palos, de los calescuelgan como corvinus de cuero por dentro, que forman las divisionssegun las necesitan, atandolas de alto abajo £l los mismos palos amanera de ramparts fires : por afuera llega el cuero hasta el suelopor el NO y S, dejandole siempre la puerto al E de toda la anchordel toldo, el cual queda como si fuse una cueva ovalada.

It was evident, fromtheir great surprise, and every part of their behaviour, as well astheir not having one thing in their possession which could be derivedfrom white people, that they had never seen such. Their clothing wasnothing but a bit of some beast's skin about their waists, and somethingwoven from feathers over the shoulders ; and as they utteredno word of any language we had ever heard, nor had any method ofmaking themselves understood, we presided they could have had nointercourse vdth Europeans. These savages, who, upon their departure,left us a few muscles, returned in two days, and surprisedus by bringing three sheep." . . . . "At this interview webartered with them for a dog or two, which we roasted and eat."In one of my walks, seeing a very large bird of prey upon aneminence, I endeavoured to come upon it unperceived with my gun,by means of the woods which lay at the back of that eminence ; but,when I had proceeded so far in the wood as to think I was in a linewith it, I heard a growing close by me, which made me think itadvisable to retire as soon as possible : the woods were so gloomy Icould see nothing ; but, as I retired, this noise followed me close tillI had got out of them. Some of our men did assure me, that theyhad seen a very large beast in the woods ; but their description of itwas too imperfect to be relied upon."tThe first night we put into a good harbour, a few leagues to thesouthward of Wager Island ; where, finding a large bitch big withpuppies, we regaled upon them. In this expedition we had ourusual bad weather and breaking seas, which were grown to such aheight the third day, that we were obUged, through distress, to pushin at the first inlet we saw at hand. This we had no sooner enteredthan we were presented with a view of a fine bay, in which, havingsecured the barge, we went ashore, but the weather being very rainy,and finding nothing to subsist upon, we pitched a bell tent, whichwe had brought with us, in the wood opposite to where the bargelay. As this tent was not large enough to contain us all, I proposed• Natives of the Guaianeco Islands.t Showing; that the puma crosses arms of the sea R. F,APPENDIX. 125to four of the people to go to the end of the bay, about two milesdistant from the bell tent, to occupy the skeleton of an old Indianwigwam, which I had discovered in a walk that way upon our firstlanding. This we covered to windward with sea-weed ; and, lightinga fire, laid ourselves down in hopes of finding a remedy for ourhunger in sleep ; but we had not long composed ourselves before oneof our company was disturbed by the blowing of some animal at hisface ; and, upon opening his eyes, was not a little astonished to seeby the glimmering of the fire, a large beast standing over him. Hehad presence of mind enough to snatch a brand from the fire, whichwas now very low, and thrust it at the nose of the animal, whothereupon made off." . . . . "In the morning, we were notalittle anxious to know how our companions had fared ; and thisanxiety was increased upon om: tracing the footsteps of the beast inthe sand, in a direction towards the bell tent. The impression wasdeep and plain, of a large round foot well furnished vnth. claws.Upon acquainting the people in the tent with the circumstances ofour story, we found that they too had been visited by the same unwelcomeguest, which they had driven away by much the same expedient."We now returned from this cruise, with a strong gale, toWager's Island ; here we soon discovered, by the quarters of dogshanging up, that the Indians had brought a fresh supply to ourmarket. Upon inquiry, we found that there had been six canoes ofthem, who, among other methods of taking fish, had taught their dogsto drive the fish into a comer of some pond, or lake, from whence theywere easily taken out by the skill and address of these savages."Upon returning up the Lagoon,* we were so fortunate as to killsome seal, which we boiled and laid in the boat for sea-stock. Whilewe were ranging along-shore in detached parties, in quest of thisand whatever other eatable might come in our way, oiu- surgeon,who was then by himself, discovered a pretty large hole, whichseemed to lead to some den, or repository, within the rocks. It wasnot so rude, or natural, but that there were some signs of its havingbeen cleared and made more accessible by industry. The surgeonfor some time hesitated whether he should venture in, from his uncertaintyas to the reception he might meet with from any inhabitant; but his curiosity getting the better of his fears, he determinedto go in ; which he did upon his hands and knees, as theHolloway Sound — near Port Otway.APPENDIX.passage was too low for him to enter otherwise. After having proceededa considerable way thus, he arrived at a spacious chamber ;but whether hollowed out by hands, or natural, he could not bepositive. The light into this chamber was conveyed through a holeat the top ; in the midst was a kind of bier, made of sticks laidcrossways, supported by props about five feet in height. Upon thisbier, five or six bodies were extended, which, in appearance, had beendeposited there a long time ; but had suffered no decay or diminution.They were without covering, and the flesh of these bodies wasbecome perfectly dry and hard ; which, whether done by any art orsecret the savages may be possessed of, or occasioned by any dryingvirtue in the air of the cave, could not be guessed. Indeed, the surgeonfinding nothing there to eat, which was the chief inducementfor his creeping into the hole, did not amuse himself with long disquisitions,or make that accurate examination which he would havedone at another time ; but, crawling out as he came in, he went andtold the first he met of what he had seen. Some had the curiosityto go in lilcevidse. I had forgot to mention that there was anotherrange of bodies, deposited in the same manner, upon another platformunder the bier. Probably this was the burial-place of theirgreat men, called caciques ; but from whence they could be brought,we were utterly at a loss to conceive, there being no traces of anyIndian settlement hereabout. We lead seen no savage since we leftthe island, or observed any marks in the coves or bays to the northward,where we had touched, such as lire-places, or old wigwams,which they never fail of leaving behind them ; and it is very probable,from the violent seas that are always beating upon this coast,its deformed aspect, and the very swampy soil that every whereborders upon it, that it is little frequented."A few days after our return, the mystery of the nailing up ofthe hut, and what had been doing by the Indians upon the island inour absence was partly explained to us ; for about the fifteenth dayafter there came a party of Indians to the island in two canoes,who were not a little surprised to find us here again. Among thesewas an Indian of the tribe of the Honos, who live in the neighbourhoodof Chiloe. He talked the Spanish language, but with thatsavage accent which renders it almost unintelligible to any but thosewho are adepts in that language. He was likewise a cacique, orAPPENDIX. 1S7leading man of his tribe, which authority was confirmed to him bythe Spaniards ; for he carried the usual badge and mark of distinctionby which the Spaniards and their dependents hold their militaryand civil employments, which is a stick with a silver head."This report of our shipwreck (as we supposed) having reachedthe Honos by means of the intermediate tribes, which handed it tosone another, from those Indians who visited us ; this cacique wasneither sent to learn the truth of the rumour, or, having first got theintelligence, set out with a view of making some advantage of thewreck,"Having understood my necessities, they (the two women) talkedtogether some little time ; after which, getting up, they both wentout, taking with them a couple of dogs, which they train to assistthem in fishing. After an hour's absence, they came in tremblingwith cold, and their hair streaming %Yith water, and brought twowish, which, having broiled, they gave me the largest share; andthen we all laid down, as before, to rest."After roving some time, they (the women) gained such anoffing as they required, where the water was about eight or tenfathoms deep, and there lay upon their oars. And now the youngestof the two women, talking a basket in her mouth, jumped overboard,and diving to the bottom, continued under water an amazing time ;when she had filled the basket with sea-eggs, she came up to the boat-side,and delivering it so filled to the other women in the boat, theytook out the contents, and returned it to her. The diver then, afterhaving taken a short time to breathe, went dora and up again, withthe same success ; and so several times for the space of half an hour.It seems as if Providence had endued this people with a kind ofamphibious nature, as the sea is the only source from whence almostall their subsistence is derived. This element, too, being herevery boisterous, and falling with a most heavy surf upon a ruggedcoast, very little, except some seal, is to be got any where but in thequiet bosom of the deep. What occasions this reflection is, the earlypropensity I had so frequently observed in the children of thesesavages to this occupation, who, even at the age of three years,might be seen crawling upon their hands and lines among the rocks128 APPENDIX.and breakers, from which they would tumble themselves into thesea, without regard to the cold, which is often intense, and showingno fear of the noise and roaring of the surf."The water was at this time extremely cold, and when the diversgot into the boats, they seemed greatly benumbed ; and it is usualwith them, after this exercise, if they are near enough to their wigwams,to run to the fire, to which presenting one side, they rub andchafe it for some time ; then turning the other, use it in the samemanner, till the circulation of the blood is restored. This practice,if it has no worse effect, must occasion their being more susceptibleof the impressions of cold than if they waited the gradual advancesof their natural warmth in the open air. I leave it to the decision ofthe gentlemen of the faculty, whether this too hasty approach to thefire may not subject them to a disorder I observed among them,called the elephantiasis, or swelling of the legs. The divers havingreturned to their boats, we continued to row tiU towards the evening,when we landed upon a low point. As soon as the canoes werehauled up, they employed themselves in erecting their wigwams,.which they despatch with great address and quickness. I still enjoyedthe protection of my two good Indian women, who made metheir guest here as before. They first regaled me with sea-eggs, andthen went out upon another kind of fishery, by the means of dogsand nets. These dogs are a cur-Uke looking animal, but verysagacious, and easily trained to this business. Though, in appearance,an uncomfortable sort of sport, yet they engage in it readily,seem to enjoy it much, and express their eagerness by barkingevery time they raise their heads above the water to breathe. Thenet is held by two Indians, who get into the water ; then the dogs,talking a large compass, dive after the fish, and drive them into thenet ; but it is only in particular places that the fish are taken in thismanner."I now understood that the two Indian women with whom Isojourned were wives to this chieftain, though one was young enoughto be his daughter ; and as far as I could learn, did really stand inthe different relations to him both of daughter and vdfe. It waseasy to be perceived that aU did not go well between them at thistime ; either that he was not satisfied with the answers they returnedAPPENDIX. 129him to his questions, or that he suspected some misconduct on theirside ; for, presently after, breaking out into savage fury, he took theyoung one up in his arms, and threw her with violence against thestones ; but his brutal resentment did not stop here, he beat herafterwards in a cruel manner. I could not see this treatment of mybenefactress without the highest concern for her, and rage againstthe author of it ; especially as the natural jealousy of these peoplegave occasion to think that it was on my account she suffered. Icould hardly suppress the first emotions of my resentment, whichprompted me to return him his barbarity in his own kind ; but, besidesthat this might have drawn upon her fresh marks of his severity, itwas neither poetic, nor, indeed, in my power, to have done it to anygood purpose at this time."Our untoward circumstances now found some relief in thearrival of the Indians we waited for ; who brought with them someseal, a small portion of which feU to our share. A night or two Sifterthey sent out some of their young men, who procured us a quantityof a very delicate kind of birds, called shags and cormorants. Theirmanner of taking these birds resembles something a sport calledBat-fowling.' They find out their haunts among the rocks andcliffs in the night, when, taking with them torches made of the barkof the birch tree, which is common here, and grows to a very largesize (this bark has a very unctuous quality, and emits a bright andclear light, and in the northern parts of America is used frequentlyinstead of candle), they bring the boat's side as near as possible tothe rocks, under the roosting places of these birds ; then, wavingtheir Hghts backwards and forwards, the birds are dazzled and confoundedso as to fall into the canoe, where they are instantly Mockedon the head with a short stick the Indians take with them for thatpurpose. Seals are taken in some less frequented parts of thesecoasts with great ease ; but when their haunts have been two orthree times disturbed, they soon learn to provide for their safety, byrepairing to the water upon the first alarm. This is the case withthem hereabouts ; but as they frequently raise their heads abovewater, either to breathe or look about them, I have seen an Indian atthis interval throw his lance with such dexterity as to strike theanimal through both its eyes at a great distance ; and it is veryseldom that they miss their aim."130 APPENDIX.These Indians are of middling stature, well set, and very active;and make their way among the rocks with an amazing agility. Theirfeet, by this kind of exercise, contract a callosity which renders theuse of shoes quite unnecessary to them. But before I conclude thefew observations I have to make on a people so confined in all theirnotions and practices, it may be expected I should say something oftheir religion ; but as their gross ignorance is in nothing more conspicuous,and as we foimd it advisable to keep out of their way whenthe fits of devotion came upon them, which are rather frantic thanreligious, the reader can expect very little satisfaction on this head.Accident has sometimes made me unavoidably a spectator of scenesI should have chosen to have withdrawn myself from ; and so far Iam instructed. As there are no fixed seasons for their religiousexercises, the younger people wait till the elders find themselvesdevoutly disposed, who begin the ceremony by several deep anddismal groans, which rise gradually to a hideous kind of singing, fromwhich they proceed to enthusiasm, and work themselves into a dispositionthat borders on madness; for suddenly jumping up, theysnatch fire brands from the fire, put them in their mouths, and runabout burning every body they come near : at other times, it is acustom with them to wound one another with sharp muscle-shellstill they are besmeared with blood. These orgies continue till thosewho preside in them foam at the mouth, grow faint, are exhaustedwith fatigue, and dissolve in a profusion of sweat. When the mendrop their part in this frenzy, the women take it up, acting overagain much the same kind of wild scene, except that they ratheroutdo the men in shrieks and noise. Our cacique, who had beenreclaimed from these abominations by the Spaniards, and just knewthe exterior form of crossing himself, pretended to be much offendedat these profane ceremonies, and that he would have died soonerthan have partaken of them. Among other expressions of his disapprobation,he declared, that whilst the savages solemnized thesehorrid rites, he never failed to hear strange and uncommon noises inthe woods, and to see frightful visions ; and assured us, that thedevil was the chief actor among them on these occasions."Here I must relate an anecdote of ovu: nominally Christian cacique.He and his wife had gone off, at some distance from the shore,in their canoe, when she dived for sea-eggs ; but not meeting withAPPENDIX.great success, they returned a good deal out of humour. A littleboy of theirs, about three years old, whom they appeared to becoaxingly fond of, watching for his father and mother's return, raninto the surf to meet them : the father handed a basket of eggs tothe child, which being too heavy for him to carry, he let it fall, uponwhich the father jumped out of the canoe, and catching the boy upin his arms, dashed him with the utmost violence against the stones.The poor little creature lay motionless and bleeding, and in thatcondition was taken up by the mother ; but died soon after. Sheappeared inconsolable for some time; but the brute, his father,shewed little concern about it."The first thing that the Indians did in the mong, was to taketheir canoes to pieces : and here, for the information of the reader,itwiU be necessary to describe the structure of these boats, which areextremely well calculated for the use of these Indians, as they arefrequently obliged to carry them over-land a long way together,through thick woods, to avoid doubling capes and head-lands, in seaswhere no open boat could hive. They generally consist of five pieces,or planks ; one for the bottom and two for each side ; and as thesepeople have no iron tools, the labour must be great in hacking asingle plank out of a large tree with shells and flints, though withthe help of fire. Along the edges of the plank they made small holes,at about an inch from one to the other, and sew them together withthe supple-jack, or woodbine ; but as these holes are not filled up bythe substance of the woodbine, their boats would be immediately fullof water if they had not a method of preventing it. They do thisvery effectually by the bark of a tree, which they first steep inwater for some time, and then beat it between two stones till itanswers the use of oakum, and then chinese each hole so well, thatthey do not admit of the least water coming through, and are easilytaken asunder and put together again. When they have occasionto go over-land, as at this time, each man or woman carries a plank,whereas it would be impossible for them to drag a heavy boatentire."Quite worn out ^\dth fatigue, I soon feU asleep, and awakingbefore day, I thought I heard some voices at no great distance fromme. As the day appeared, looking further into the wood, I per-132 APPENDIX.civet a wigwam, and immediately made towards it ; but the receptionI met with was not at all agreeable ; for stooping to get intoit, I presently received two or three lacks in my face, and at thesame time heard the sound of voices seemingly in anger, which mademe retire and wait at the foot of a tree, where I remained till an oldwoman peeped out, and made signs to me to draw near. I obeyedvery ready, and went into the wigwam : in it where three men andtwo women ; one young man seemed to have great respect shewnto him by the rest, though he was the most miserable object I eversaw. He was a perfect skeleton, and covered with sores from headto foot. I was happy to sit a moment by their fire, as I was quitebenumbed with cold. The old woman took out a piece of seal,holding one part of it between her feet, and the other end in herteeth, and then cut off some thin slices with a sharp shell, anddistributed them about to the other Indians. She then put a biton the fire, taking a piece of fat in her mouth, which she keptchewing, every now and then spirting some of it on the piece thatwas warming upon the fire ; for they never do more vnth. it thanwarm it through. When it was ready, she gave me a little bit,which I swallowed whole, being almost starved. As these Indianswere all strangers to me, I did not know which way they were going ;and, indeed, it was now become quite indifferent to me which way Iwent, whether to the northward or southward, so that they wouldbut take me with them, and give me something to eat. However,to make them comprehend me, I pointed first southward, andafter to the lake, and I soon understood they were going to thenorthward. They all went out together, excepting the sick Indian,and took up the planks of the canoe, which lay near the wigwam,and carried them upon the beach, and presently put it together ;and, getting everything into it, they put me to the oar. We rowedacross the lake to the mouth of a very rapid river, whei'e we putashore for that night, not daring to get any way down in the dark,as it required the greatest skill, even in the day, to avoid runningfoul of the stumps and roots of trees, of which this river was fuU.* Ipassed a melancholy night, as they would not suffer me to come nearthe wigwam they had made ; nor did they give me the least bit ofany one thing to eat since we embarked. In the morning we set offagain. The weather proved extremely bad the whole day. We• In March — April : beginning of autumn. — Carlo de Person ?— R, F.APPENDIX. Misswent down the river at an amazing rate ; and, just before night,they put ashore upon a stony beach. They hauled the canoe up,and all disappeared in a moment, and I was left quite alone : itrained violently, and was very dark. I thought it was as well to Uedown upon the beach, half side in water, as to get into a swampunder a dropping tree. In this dismal situation I fell asleep, andawaked three or four hours after in such agonies with the cramp,that I thought I must die upon the spot. I attempted several timesto raise myself upon my legs, but could not. At last, I madeshift to get upon my knees, and, looking towards the wood, Isaw a great fire at some distance from me. I was a long timecrawling to it ; and when I reached it, I threw myself almost into it,in hopes of finding some relief from the pain I suffered. This intrusiongave great offence to the Indians, who immediately got up,kicking and beating me till they drove me to some distance from it ;however, I contrived, a little after, to place myself so as to receivesome warmth from it ; by which I got rid of the cramp. In the morning,we left this place, and were soon after out of the river. Beingnow at sea again, the Indians intended putting ashore at the firstconvenient place to look for she-fish, their stock of provisionshaving been quite exhausted for some time. At low water welanded upon a spot that seemed to promise well ; and here we foundplenty of limpets. Though at this time starving, I did not attemptto eat one, lest I should lose a moment in gathering them ; notknowing how soon the Indians might be going again. I had almostfilled my hat, when I saw them returning to the canoe. I madewhat haste I coidd to her ; for I believe they would have made noconscience of leaving me behind. I sat down to my oar again,placing my hat close to me, every now and then eating a Hmpet.The Indians were employed the same way, when one of them seeingme throw the shells overboard, spoke to the rest in a violent passion ;and, getting up, fell upon me, and seizing me by an old ragged handkerchiefI had about my neck, almost throttled me ; whilst anothertook me by the legs, and was going to throw me overboard, if theold woman had not prevented them. I was aU this time entirelyignorant by what means I had given offence, till I observed that theIndians, after eating the limpets, carefully put the shells in a heap atthe bottom of the canoe. I then concluded there was some superstitionabout throwing these shells into the sea, my ignorance of134 APPENDIX.which had very nearly cost me my life. I was resolved to eat nomore limpets till we landed, which we did some time after, upon anisland. I then took notice that the Indians brought aU their shellsashore, and laid them above high-water mark. Here, as I was goingto eat a large bunch of berries I had gathered from a tree, for theylooked very tempting, one of the Indians snatched them out of myhand and threw them away, making me to understand that theywere poisonous. Thus, in all probability, did these people now savemy life, who, a few hours before, were going to take it from me forthrowing away a shell."One day, we fell in with about forty Indians, who came downto the beach we landed on, curiously painted.* Our cacique seemedto understand but little of their language, and it sounded to us verydifferent from what we had heard before. However, they made uscomprehend that a ship had been upon the coast not far from wherewe then were, and that she had a red flag : this, we understoodsome time after, to have been the Anna Pink, whose adventures are . ,particularly related in Lord Anson's voyage ; and we passed throughthe very harbour she had lain inst• Probably in the neighbourhood of the ' Ester de Aysen.' in lat.45° S — R.

: but thefeet are broad though short. This peculiarity, no doubt, is owing totheir mode of life : being a people who take little exercise, but sit constantlyhuddled together in their canoes or wigwams ; the blood, thesource of nourishment, can only circulate freely, and must in greaterquantity, in the head and trunk, from the obstruction to its passage intothe limbs, owing to their bent position. From the same cause, thewant of exercise, this is the form of the Esquimaux and Laplanders.A man whom I examined was of the middle size, five feet seveninches, and his muscular power about a medium ; the circumferenceof the—Ft. in.Thorax 3 1Abdomen . . . 2 7Pelvis 2 5Thigh 1 10Calf of the leg 1Arm 1Fore-arm . . . 11Length of the head from thechin upwards 9Length of body, from thesymphysis pubis to the topof the sternum . . 2Length of thigh 17Length of legof armof fore-arm and handfrom spine to sternum,externally .same internallyBreadth of thoraxof hypochondriac regionsof pelvis betweensuperior and spinous processes. . .Ft.In.IIAl'PENDIX. 343I consider that this man was about the average stature of theFuegians : they are generally short and broad.The Fuegian, like a Cetaceous animal which circulates red bloodin a cold medium, has in his covering an admirable non-conductor ofheat ; the corpus adipose envelopes the body to preserve that temperaturenecessary to continue the vital functions and circulation of thefluids. In this individual it was particularly thick over the abdomenand dorsum ; on the hips it formed a perfect cushion, and filedup the interstices between the muscles in general. Unlike the limbsof porters, smiths, and other athlete in Europe, where the form andsize of each muscle may be traced while in action, the limbs of thesepeople are round and smooth, like the female sex, or the childin infancy. The quantity of fat is to be imputed to their diet ; theirfood is shell-fish and birds, but the greatest dainty is fat of all kinds,that of the seal and penguin in particular ; as for vegetable alimentthey have none,* nor any taste for it. The muscles were soft, andthe viscera (in particular the heart, Ever, and lungs,) in good order,a circumstance which but rarely occurs : the bones were well-formed,with their processes, foramina, and sutures complete.The complexion of this man was dark ; his skin of a copper colour,the native hue of the Fuegian tribes ; the eyes and hair black (thisis universal, as far as I have seen, and predominates throughout allthe aborigines of America, from the Fuegians to the Esquimaux) ;the epidermis is thicker than in white men ; but in the rete mucousI saw no difference, the copper hue arising from the vessels of thecutis, shining through a thickened scarf-skin, and from its incorporatingthe particles of smoke and ochre with which their bodies arecontinually covered.The hair on this man's head was jet-black, straight, long, andluxuriant, but scanty on other parts of the body. The Fuegianshave little beard and no whiskers.The features of this individual were rounder than they generallyare among those of his nation ; the form of whose countenanceresembles that of the Laplanders and Esquimaux ; they have broadfaces with projecting cheek-bones ; the eyes of an oval form, anddrawn towards the temples ; the tunica sclerotica of a yellow-white,and the iris deep black ; the cartilage of the nose broad and dear.Wilson was not aware that they eat birch excrescences, andberries. — R. F.144 Al'PKNDIX.pressed; the orifice of the mouth large, when shut forming astraight Ene, when open an ellipsis. The head is bulky, and thehair straight.The phrenological marks in the skull (said by some persons toinclude corresponding organs in the brain,) taken on the spot, wereas follows : —The Propensities.Amativeness— full. Destructiveness— very large.Philoprogenitiveness— moderately full. Constructiveness— small.Concentrativeiiess— ditto. Acquisitiveness— small.Adhesiveness— fii41.

Form— small.Time— ditto Number — very small.Tune— ditto Language— full.Comparison — small. Causality — small.Wit — ditto Imitation — dittoThe facial angle, according to Camper, 74°, the occipital, 80°.The warlike propensities in this man were large, agreeing withthe little which I know of his history. Taking a general viewof the head, the Propensities (the organs most exercised by a barbarian)are large and fuU ; the Sentiments small, few of which areever called into action, except cautiousness and firmness, which arelarge ; finally, the Intellectual organs, which are chiefly used byman In a civilized state, are small.The teeth are perfect, and of the usual number ; the incisors flatand apparently worn down ; other instances of which I have seen.From this it is probable they are sometimes used as grinders.* Thereverse of this has been frequently noticed among savages ; some, itis said, file their teeth to render them more terrible in battle, whileothers pul out the two centre incisors, or the cuspidati, by wayThis man could not have been more than forty : probably he wasmany years younger. — R. F.APPENDIX. ' 145of ornament. Their teeth are generally good, regular, and healthy,arising in all probability from the system being free from any constitutionaltaint.The viscera of the thorax were healthy, the heart particularly so,with its valves and columna carlos in good order ; the lower partof the thorax and the whole parietes of the abdomen were unusuallyexpanded ; the liver very large though healthy, occupying the righthypochondriac and lumbar, the epigastric, and left hypochondriacregions; the spleen remarkably small; the stomach of a moderatesize, and containing some muscles and limpets in a half-digestedstate ; the intestines were filled with flatus, which probably tookplace after death. The large size of the abdomen is to be referredto the squatting position these people assume, the knees and thighsbeing brought up against the lower part of the belly, force theviscera and intestines upward and forward, thereby distending thelower part of the thorax and front of the abdomen. Here is apeculiarity from habit becoming inherent in the constitution, anddescending to posterity, as the children, male and female, are bornwith large bellies. In like manner Chinese children, from theirparents' custom of compressing the feet, are born ^^-ith them remarkablysmall.Besides distending the abdomen mechanically — to this bent positionis to be traced the enlarged state of the abdominal viscera, thepassage of blood to the extremities being obstructed ; an unusualquantity is thereby determined to, and circulated in, the coehac andmesenteric arteries ; the want of support from dress is also to betakeninto account. From this stretched and distended state of theabdomen, separating the fibres of the oblique and transverse muscles,and the open state of the inguinal rings, these people must bepeculiarly liable on any exertion to ventral hernia : these passages Ifound open in this individual ; and they appeared to be in the samestate in other men whom I examined. Cardiac affections mostlyprevail among those who are subject to violent exercise, as porters,carriers, and artillerymen. The healthy state of this heart, whichit is probable will be generally the case among the Fuegians, is to beimputed to their moderate exertions. In their canoes they areemployed fishing or paddling ; in their wigwams, which are seldommany yards from the beach, cooking or malting small wares of thebones or skins of beasts. The cremaster muscle was strong and146 APPENDIX.fleshy ; the lower extremities were short and ill-proportioned ; thethigh of a moderate size, but from the smallness of the musclesof the leg in general, and testator in particular, it lookedlarge ; the calf of the leg was very small. The diminutive sizeof these muscles must be referred to the cause already mentioned —the want of a due circulation in these parts, produced by a crampedposition and want of exercise. Having the feet broad and shortis common to all who do not M^ear shoes, the bones being somewhatseparated, the ligaments stretched, and the muscles flattened fromconstantly sustaining the weight of the body unsupported by anycovering to the feet. The kidneys were healthy, but unusuallydestitute of fat. There was no tunica adipose ; the adeps, in thisinstance, was chiefly collected on the surface, but little in the internalparts. If this is universally the case, it is a wonderfulprovision of nature to protect their bodies from the inclemency ■ ofthis inhospitable region. This is the method adopted by natureduring the first years of infancy, to habituate the constitution tothe vicissitudes and variations of the atmosphere, which otherwisewould be incompatible with existence. The arms were better proportionedthan the lower extremities ; and this is general throughoutthe Fuegian tribes ; the muscles being firmer, and better formed,from the more constant use of these parts, paddling in theircanoes, climbing, and making their wigwams. The muscles ingeneral, throughout the body, were healthy, but soft and flabby,unlike the firm sinewy muscle of hardy mountaineers : and the bonesless indented than is usual in those who have been accustomedto vigorous exertion.In another Fuegian, whom I examined, the marks of the Phrenologicalorgans, as taken from the skull, were as follows : —The Propensities.Amativeness— small. Destructiveiiess— full.Philoprogenitiveness — very large. Constructiveness — snial!.Coiicentrativeness— full. Acquisitiveness full.Combativeness— very large. Secretiveness— large.The Sentiments.Self-esteem— very large. Veneration— full.Love of approbation— full. Hope— small.Cautiousness-large. Ideality— small.Benevolence— small.

Wit— dittoCausality— ditto Imitation— dittoThe facial angle, 76°, the occipital, seinthis skull also, the propensities were large ; the moral sentimentslarger than in the former, but the intellectual organs equally small.Destructiveness, secretiveness, and cautiousness, large — faculties,as I have remarked, necessary to a savage vi'arrior : the more refinedsentiments, as benevolence, ideality, and conscientiousness weresmall, with nearly all the intellectual organs.In this man, also, the teeth were complete ; but the incisors notworn down, as in the former : their general regularity and goodarrangement were greatly owing to the expanded state of the jaws,giving good space for their growth and shedding. In those personswho have sharp features, where the sides of the face meet at an acuteangle, the teeth are often small ; or, if large, from want of room,they overlap each other, or push one another out of the naturalpositions. The broadness of the face and features is owing to thebreadth of the base of the cranium, which gives shape and form tothe bones of the face. With respect to the arms and legs of thisman, I have only to remark, that they agreed exactly with those ofthe other, in the largeness of the thigh compared to the leg, breadthof the feet, and better proportion of the upper extremities.John Wilson, (d) Surgeon.148 APPENDIX.No. 17.Phrenological Remarks on three Fuegians.*YoKCusHLu, a female, ten years of age.Strong in attachment.If offended, her passions strong.A little disposed to cunning, but not duplicity.She will manifest some ingenuity.She is not at aU disposed to be covetous.Self win at times very active.Fond of notice and approbation.She vnll show a benevolent feeing when able to do so.Strong feelings for a Supreme Being.Disposed to be honest.Rather inclined to mimicry and imitation.Her memory good of visible objects and localities, with a strongattachment to places in which she has lived.It would not be difficult to make her a useful member of Societyin a short time, as she would readily receive instruction.Orundellico, a Fuegian, aged fifteen.He will have to struggle against anger, self-viill, animal inclinations,and a disposition to combat and destroy.Rather inclined to cunning.Not covetous ; not very ingenious.Fond of directing and leading.Very cautious in his actions : but fond of distinction and approbation.He will manifest strong feelings for a Supreme Being.Strongly inclined to benevolence.May be safely intrusted vidth the care of property.Memory, in general, good ; particularly for persons, objects ofsense, and localities.To accustomed places he would have a strong attachment.Like the female, receiving instruction readily, he might be made auseful member of society ; but it would require great care, as self-vidllwould interfere much.Made in London, in 1830.APPENDIX.

Louis de Bougainville for thedelivering up of the Salinas.I, Monsieur Louis de Bougainville, colonel of his most ChristianMajesty's army, have received six hundred and eighteen thousandone hundred and eight livres, thirteen sols, and eleven deniers, beingthe amount of an estimate that I have given in, of the expenses incurredby the St. Malo Company in equipments for founding their intrusiveestablishments in the Melvin Islands, belonging to his CatholicMajesty, in the following manner : —Forty thousand livres delivered on account to me in Paris, by hisExcellency the Count de Fences, ambassador of his CathoUc Majestyto that court, for which I gave the proper receipt.Two hundred thousand livres, which are to be delivered to meatthe same court of Paris, according to bills drawn in my favour by150 APPENDIX.the Marquess of Zambrano, treasurer-general of his Catholic Majesty,upon Don Francisco Ventura Lorna, treasurer-extraordinary of thesame; and sixty-five thousand six hundred and twenty-five harddollars, and three-fourth parts of another, vi'hich are equivalent to thethree hundred and seventy-eight thousand one hundred and eightlivres three sous and eleven deniers, at the rate of five livres per dollar,which I have to receive in Buenos Ayres, on account of billswhich have been delivered to me, dravvTj by his excellency the BayHoFray, Don Julian Marriage, secretary of state for the general departmentof the Indies and navy of his CathoUc Majesty.In consideration of these payments, as well as in obedience tohis Most Christian Majesty's orders, I am bound to deliver up, indueformality, to the cohort of Spain, those establishments, along withthe families, houses, works, timber, and shipping built there, andemployed in the expedition ; and, finally, every thing therein belongingto the St. Malo Company, as included in the accounts which areso settled, and to his Most Christian Majesty, by this voluntary cession,making void for ever all claims that the company, or any personinterested therein may have, or might produce, upon the treasury ofhis Most CathoUc Majesty ; nor can they henceforth demand morepecuniary, or any other compensation whatsoever. In testimonywhereof, I set my name to this present instrument and voucher, asone principally interested, as well as authorized to receive the wholeof this sum, agreeably to a registry in the department of state in St.Ildefonso, 4th October, 1766.(Signed) " Louis de Bougainville."Viscount Palmerston to M. de Moreno.Foreign Office, January 8, 1824.The undersigned, &c. has the honour to acknowledge the receiptof the note of M. Moreno, &c. dated the 17th of June last, in whichhe formally protests, in the name of his government, " against thesovereignty lately assumed in the Melvin (or Falkland) Islands, bythe crovni of Great Britain."Before the undersigned proceeds to reply to the allegations advancedin M. Moreno's note, upon which his protest against this act on thepart of his Majesty is founded, the undersigned deems it proper todraw M. Moreno's attention to the contents of the protest which Mr.APPENDIX. ' 151Parish, the British Charge d' Affaires, at Buenos Ayres, addressed, inthe name of his court, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of theRepublic, on the 19th of November 1829, in consequence of the BritishGovernment having been informed that the president of the UnitedProvinces of the Rio de la Plata had issued decrees, and had madegrants of land, in the nature of acts of sovereignty over the islandsin question.That protest made known to the government of the United Provincesof the Rio de la Plata : —1st. That the authority which that government had thus assumedwas considered by the British Government as incompatible with thesovereign rights of Great Britain over the Falkland Islands.2dly. That those sovereign rights, which were founded upon theoriginal discovery and subsequent occupation of those islands, hadacquired an additional sanction from the fact, that his Catholic Majestyhad restored the British settlement, which had been forcibly takenpossession of by a Spanish force, in the year 1771.3dly. That the withdrawal of his Majesty's forces from the FalklandIslands, in 1774, could not invalidate the just rights of GreatBritain, because that withdrawal took place only in pursuance of thesystem of retrenchment adopted at that time by his Majesty's Government.4thly. That the marks and signals of possession and of property,left upon the islands, the British flag still flying, and all the otherformalities observed upon the occasion of the departure of the governor,were calculated not only to assert the rights of ownership, but toindicate the intention of resuming the occupation of the territory atsome future period.Upon these grounds Mr. Parish protested against the pretensionsset up on the part of the Argentine Republic, and against all actsdone to the prejudice of the just rights of sovereignty heretoforeexercised by the crown of Great Britain.The Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic acknowledged thereceipt of the British protest ; and acquainted Mr. Parish that hisgovernment would give it their particular consideration, and that hewould communicate to him their decision upon the subject, so soonas he should receive directions to that effect.No answer was, however, at any time returned, nor was any objectionraised, on the part of the government of the United Provinces of152 Appendix.the Rio de la Plata, to the rights of Great Britain, as asserted in thatprotest ; but the Buenos Ayrean government persisted, notwithstandingthe receipt of that protest, in exercising those acts of sovereigntyagainst which the protest was specially directed.The government of the United Provinces of the Rio de la Platacould not have expected, after the explicit declaration which had beenso formally made of the right of the crown of Great Britain to theislands in question, that his Majesty would silently submit to such acourse of proceeding ; nor could that government have been surprisedat the step which his Majesty thought proper to take, in order to theresumption of rights which had never been abandoned, and whichhad only been permitted to he dormant, under circumstances whichhad been explained to the Buenos Ayrean government.The claim of Great Britain to the sovereignty of the FalklandIslands having been unequivocally asserted and maintained, duringthose discussions with Spain, in 1770 and 1771, which nearly led toa war between the two countries, and Spain having deemed it properto put an end to those discussions, by restoring to his Majesty theplaces from which British subjects had been expelled, the governmentof the United Provinces could not reasonably have anticipated thatthe British Government would permit any other state to exercise aright,as derived from Spain, which Great Britain had denied to Spainherself ; and this consideration alone would fully justify his Majesty'sGovernment Lq declining to enter into any further explanation upona question which, upwards of half a century ago, was so notoriouslyand decisively adjusted with another government more immediatelyconcerned.But M. Moreno, in the note which he has addressed to the undersigned,has endeavoured to shew that, at the termination of thememorable discussions referred to between Great Britain and Spain,a secret understanding existed between the two courts, in virtue ofwhich Great Britain was pledged to restore the islands to Spain at asubsequent period, and that the evacuation of them, in 1774, by hisMajesty, was the fulfilment of that pledge.The existence of such a secret understanding is alleged to beproved ; first, by the reservation, as to the former right of sovereigntyover the islands, which was contained in the Spanish declaration,delivered at the time of the restoration of Port Egmont and its dependenciesto his Majesty ; and, secondly, by the concurrent descriptionAPPENDIX. 153of the transaction, as it took place between the parties, given in certaindocuments and historical works.Although the reservation referred to cannot be deemed to possessany substantial weight, inasmuch as no notice whatever is taken of itin the British counter-declaration, which was exchanged against it ;and although the evidence adduced fi-om unauthentic historical publicationscannot be regarded as entitled to any weight whatever with aview to a just decision upon a point of international rights ; yet asthe allegations above-mentioned involve an imputation against thegood faith of Great Britain, to which his Majesty's Government cannotbut feel sensibly alive, the undersigned has been honoured with theKing's commands to cause the official correspondence with the courtof Madrid, at the period alluded to, to be carefully inspected, in orderthat the circumstances which really took place upon the occasionmight be accurately ascertained.That inspection has accordingly been made, and the undersignedhas the honour to communicate to M. Moreno the following extracts,which contain all the material information that can be gathered fromthat correspondence relative to the transaction in question : —The Earl of Rochford to James Harris, Esq.St. James's, 25th January 1771.I enclose to you a copy of the declaration signed on Tuesdaylast by Prince Masserano, with that of my acceptance of it in hisMajesty's name."Spanish Declaration.Sa Majeste Britannique sextant plainte de la violence qui avoitete commis le 10 Juin de I'annee 1770, al'Ile commencement appellela Grande Maloiiine, et par les Anglais dite Falkland, en obhgeantpar la force le Commandant, et les sujets de sa Majeste Britannique,a evacuer le port par eux appele Egmont, demarche oifensante aHonneur de saCouronne, le Prince de Masseranan, Ambassadeur Extraordinairede sa Majeste Catholique, a recu ordre de declarer, etdeclare, que sa Majeste Catholique, considering Clamour dont elle estanimae pour la paix, et pour le maintien de la bonne harmonie avecsa Majeste Britannique, et reflechissant que cet vehement pourroilI'interrompre, a vu avec plaisir cette expedition capable de la troubler; et dans la persuasion ou elle est de la reciprocate de ses sentir154 APPENDIXmens, et de son elopement pour autorlser tout ce qui pouiToittroubler la bonne intelligence entre les deux Cours, sa Majeste Catholiquedesavoue la susdite entreprise violente, et, en consequence, lePrince de Masseranan declare, que sa Majeste Catholique engage adonner des ordres immediate pour qu'on reraette les choses dans laGrande Maloiiine, au port dit Egmont, preciseness dans D'etat ouelles soient avant le 10 Juin 1770, auquel effet sa Majeste Catholiquedonnera ordre a un de ses officiers, de remettre a Officierautorise par sa Majeste Britannique, le fort et le port Egmont, avectoute I'artillerie, les munitions, et eiFets de sa Majeste Britannique etde ses sujets, qui sey sont trouves le jour ci-dessus nomme, confinementa I'inventaire qui en a ete dresse.Le Prince de Masseranan declare en meme tens, au nom du Roison Maitre, que Engagement de sa dite Majeste Catholique, de restinga sa Majeste Britannique la possession du port et fort ditEgmont, ne pent ni ne doit nullement affecter la question du droitanterior de souverainete des lies Maloiiines, autrement dites Falkland.En foi de quoi, moi, le susdit Ambassadeur Extraordinaire, aisigne la presente Declaration de ma signature ordinaire, et a icellefait opposer le cachet de nos armes.

A Londres,ce 22 Janvier 1771.(Les.) (Signe) " Rochford."James Harris, Esq. to the Earl of Rochford.Madrid, 14th February 1771.They keep the declaration here as secret as possible. I do notfind any to whom they have shorn it, except those to whom theyare obliged to communicate it. They also report that we have givena verbal assurance to evacuate Falkland's Island in the space of twomonths."The Earl of Rochford to James Harris, Esq.St. James's, 8th March 1771.His Majesty has been pleased to order the Juno frigate of thirty-twoguns, the Hound sloop, and Florida store-ship, to be prepared togo to Port Egmont, in order to receive the possession from the Spanishcommander there ; and as I have spoken so fully to Prince on the manner of its being executed, it is needless for me tosay any more to you upon it.I think it right to acquaint you, that the Spanish ambassadorpressed me to have some hopes given him of our agreeing to a mutualabandoning of Falldand's Islands, to which I replied, that it wasimpossible for me to enter on that subject with him, as the restitutionmust precede every discourse relating to those islands.r 2156 APPENDIX.You will endeavour, on all occasions, to inculcate the absurdityof Spain having any apprehensions, from the state in which PortEgmont was before its capture, or the force now sent out, of hisMajesty's intending to make use of it for the annoyance of their settlementsin the South Sea, than which nothing can be farther fromthe King's inclination, who sincerely desires to preserve peace betweenthe two nations."The Earl of Rochford to the Lords of the Admiralty.St. James's, 15th March 1771.Your lordships having acquainted me that, in consequence ofhis Majesty's pleasure, signified in my letter of 22d last, you hadordered the Juno frigate, the Hound sloop, and Florida store-ship,to be prepared to proceed to Falkland's Islands, I am commanded tosignify to your lordships his Majesty's pleasure, that you order thecommander of the said frigate, as soon as those ships are ready forsea, to repair directly with them to Port Egmont, and presenting toDon FeHpe Ruiz Puente, or any other Spanish officer he finds there,the duplicates of his Catholic Majesty's orders sent herewith, toreceive, in proper form, the restitution of possession, and of theartillery, stores, and effects, agreeably to the said orders, and to theinventories signed by the Captains Farmer and Maltby (copies ofwhich are annexed), and that you direct him to take an exact accountof any deficiency which there may be of the things mentioned in thesaid inventories, in order that the same may be made good by hisCathoUc Majesty ; giving a copy of the said account, signed by himself,to the Spanish officer, and desiring an acknowledgment underhis hand of the same .being a true account.After the said restitution shall have been completed, it is theKing's pleasure that Captain Stott should return immediately toEngland with the Juno frigate and the Florida store-ship, unless hefind it necessary to leave the latter behind ; and that the Houndsloop should remain stationed in the harbour till his Majesty's furtherorders.Your lordships will cUrect Captain Stott to behave with thegreatest prudence and civility towards the Spanish commander andthe subjects of his Catholic Majesty, carefully avoiding any thingthat might give occasion to disputes or animosity, and strictlyAPPENDIX. 157restraining the crews of the ships under his command in this respect ;but if, at or after the restitution to be made, the Spanish commandershould make any protest against his Majesty's right to Port Egmont,or Falkland's Islands, it is his Majesty's pleasure that the commanderof his ships should answer the same by a counter-protest, in properterms, of his Majesty's right to the whole of the said islands, andagainst the right of his Catholic Majesty to any part of the same.In case, from any accident or otherwise. Captain Stott shouldnot, on his arrival at Port Egmont, find any officer there on the partof the King of Spain, your lordships will direct him (supposing heshould find it necessary to put any of his men on shore) to avoidsetting up any marks of possession, or letting his Majesty's coloursfly on shore, as it is for the King's honour that the possession shouldbe formally restored by an officer of his Catholic Majesty ; and forthat reason it will be proper that the King's commanding officershould keep a good look-out, and, upon perceiving the approach ofany vessel of his Catholic Majesty, should re-embark any of his menwho may at that time be on shore, that the possession may be indisputablyvacant. 'If it should happen that after the King's ships shall haveremained as late as all October, no Spanish officer should yet appear,your lordships will direct Captain Stott, in such case, either to proceedhimself, or send an officer to Soledad, to deliver his CatholicMajesty's orders to the Spanish commander there, taking care not tosalute the fort as a Spanish garrison, and making a protest, in civilterms, against that settlement of his Catholic Majesty's subjects in anisland belonging to his Majesty.If, within a reasonable time after the delivery of the said orderto the Spanish commander, at Soledad, there still shall not an-ive atPort Egmont any officer of his Catholic Majesty to make the restitution,it is the King's pleasure that the commanding officer of hisships should then draw up a protest of the execution of his CatholicMajesty's late declaration, and should take formal possession, in hisMajesty's name ; hoisting his Majesty's colours on shore ; and that,leaving there the Hound sloop, and Florida store-ship (if the latter isnecessary), and sending a duplicate of his protest to the Spanishofficer at Soledad, he should proceed to England to lay before youlordships, for his Majesty's information, his report of the manner inwhich he has executed his commission.158 Appendix.Your lordships will take care that a sufficient quantity of provisionsand necessaries of all kinds may be sent out in the said threevessels ; and will, at a convenient distance of time, despatch anotherstore-ship for a further supply.Pes. I also enclose to your Lordships the copy of his CatholicMajesty's order to Don Felipe Ruiz Puente, with its translation."Order of the King of Spain.(Translation.)It being agreed between the King and his Britannic Majesty, bya Convention signed in London on the 22d of January last past, bythe Prince of Masserano and the Earl of Rochford, that the Great Malouine,called by the English Falkland, should be immediately replacedin the precise situation in which it was before it was evacuated bythem on the 10th June last year ; I signify to you, by the King's order,that, as soon as the person commissioned by the Court of London,shall present himself to you with this, you order the delivery of thePort de la Crusade or Egmont, and its fort and dependencies, to beeffected, as also of all the artillery, ammunition and effects, that werefound there, belonging to his Britannic Majesty and his subjects,according to the inventories signed by George Farmer and "WilliamMaltby, Esq., on the 11th July of the said year, at the time of theirquitting the same, of which I send you the enclosed copies, authenticatedunder my hand ; and that, as soon as the one and the othershall be effected with the due formalities, you cause to retire immediatelythe officer and other subjects of the King which may be there.God preserve you many years. Pardon, 7th February 1771.The Alio Fray, Don Julian de Marriage.To Don FeUpe Ruiz Puente."Captain Stott to the Admiralty.Juno, Plymouth, 9th December 1771.I must beg leave to refer their lordships to the letter I had thehonour of writing you from Rio de Janeiro, the 30th of July last,for the occurrences of my voyage to that time ; from whence I sailed,with his Majesty's ships under my command, the next day, andarrived at Port Egmont the evening of the 13th of September following.The next morning, seeing Spanish colours flying, andAPPENDIX. 159troops on shore, at the settlement formerly held by the English, Isent a lieutenant to know if any officer was there on behalf of hisCatholic Majesty, empowered to make restitution of possession tome,agreeably to the orders of his Court for that purpose, duplicatesof which I had to deliver him : I was answered, that the commandingofficer, Don Francisco de Fortuna, a lieutenant of the royalartillery of Spain, was furnished with full powers, and ready to effectthe restitution. He soon after came on board the Juno to me, whenI delivered him his Catholic Majesty's orders. We then examinedinto the situation of the settlement and stores, adjusted the form ofthe restitution and reception of the possession — instruments forwhich were settled, executed, and reciprocally delivered (that whichI received from the Spanish officer, and a copy of what I gave him,are here enclosed). On Monday, the 16th of September, I landed,followed by a party of marines, and was received by the Spanish officer,who formally restored me the possession ; on which I caused hisMajesty's colours to be hoisted and the marines to fire three volleys,and the Juno five guns, and was congratulated, as were the officerswith me, by the Spanish officer, with great cordiality on the occasion.The next day Don Francisco, with all the troops and subjectsof the King of Spain, departed in a schooner which they had withthem. I have only to add, that this transaction was effected with thegreatest appearance of good faith, without the least claim or reservebeing made by the Spanish officer iji behalf of his Court."Lord Grantham to the Earl of Rochford.Madrid, 2d January 1772.I have received the honour of your lordship's despatch, containingthe agreeable intelligence of the restitution of Port Egmont andits dependencies, with the due formalities. On receiving this notice Iwaited on the Marquis de Grimaldi, to assure him of his Majesty'ssatisfaction at the good faith and punctuality observed in this transaction.M. de Grimaldi seemed aware of the intention of my visit,and was almost beforehand with me in communicating notice of thisevent's being known in England. He seemed well pleased at theconclusion of this affair, but entered no further into conversationupon it."160 APPENDIX.The Lords of the Admiralty to the Earl of Rochford.Admiralty Office, I5th February 1772.Having received by the Florida store-ship, lately arrived at Spithead,a letter from Captain Burr, of his Majesty's sloop the Hound,dated at Port Egmont, in Falkland's Islands, the 10th of Novemberlast, giving an account that, in the preceding month, tvi^o Spanishvessels had arrived there with the artillery, provisions, and stores,which had been taken from thence by the Spaniards, and that he hadreceived the same from a commissary appointed by Don Philip RuizPuente, to deliver them up to him ; we send your lordship herewitha copy of Captain Burr's said letter, together with a copy of theinventory of the artillery provisions, and stores, which he hadreceived as aforesaid, for his Majesty's information."The Earl of Rochford to Lord Grantham.St. James's, 6th March 1772.It may be of use to inform your Excellency, that his Majestyhas determined to reduce the force employed at Falkland's Island toa small sloop with about fifty men, and twenty-five marines on shore,which will answer the end of keeping the possession : and, at thesame time, ought to make the court of Spain very easy as to ourhaving any intention of making it a settlement of annoyance tothem."The Earl of Rochford to Lord Grantham.St. James's, February 11th, 1774.I think it proper to acquaint your Excellency that Lord North,in a speech some days ago in the House of Commons, on the subjectof the Naval Establishment for this year, mentioned the intentionof reducing the naval forces in the East Indies, as a materialobject of diminishing the number of seamen ; and at the same timehinted, as a matter of small consequence, that, in order to avoidthe expense of keeping any seamen or marines at Falkland's Island,they would be brought away, after leaving there the proper marks orsignals of possession, and of its belonging to the Crown of GreatBritain. As this measure was publicly declared in Parliament, itwiR naturally be reported to the Court of Spain ; and though thereis no necessity of your Excellency's communicating this notice offi-APPENDIX. 161chilly to the Spanish ministers, since it is only a private regulationwith regard to our owt convenience ; yet, as I am inclined to think,from what passed formerly upon this subject, that they will ratherbe pleased at this event, your Excellency may, if they mention it toyou, freely avow it, without entering into any other reasoningsthereon. It must strike your Excellency that this is Likely to discouragethem from suspecting designs, which they must now plainlysee never entered into our minds. I hope they will not suspect, orsuffer themselves to be made believe, that this was done at the request,or to gratify the most distant wish, of the French court ; forthe truth is, that it is neither more nor less than a small part of aneconomical naval regulation."M. Moreno will perceive that the above authentic papers, whichhave been faithfully extracted from the Volumes of Correspondencewith Spain, deposited in the State Paper Office, contain no allusionwhatever to any secret understanding between the two Governments,at the period of the restoration of Port Egmont and its dependenciesto Great Britain, in 1771, nor to the evacuation of Falkland'sIslands, in 1774, as having taken place for the purpose of fulfillingany such understanding. On the contrary, it will be evident toM. Moreno, that their contents afford conclusive inference that nosuch secret understanding could have existed.The undersigned need scarcely assure M. Moreno, that the correspondencewhich has been referred to, does not contain the leastparticle of evidence in support of the contrary supposition, entertainedby the Government of the United Provinces of the Rio de laPlata, nor any confirmation of the several particulars related inM. Moreno's note.The undersigned trusts, that a perusal of these details will satisfyM. Moreno, that the protest which he has been directed to deliverto the undersigned, against the re-assumption of the sovereignty ofthe Falkland Islands by his Majesty, has been dravra up under anerroneous impression, as well of the understanding under which thedeclaration and counter-declaration relative to the restoration of PortEgmont and its dependencies were signed and exchanged betweenthe two courts, as of the motives which led to the temporary relinquishmentof those islands by the British Government; and the162 APPENDIX.undersigned cannot entertain a doubt but that, when the true circumstancesof the case shall have been communicated to the knowledgeof the government of the united provinces of the Rio de laPlata, that government will no longer call in question the right ofsovereignty which has been exercised by his Majesty, as undoubtedlybelonging to the CrovvTi of Great Britain.The undersigned requests, &c.(Signed) Palmerston.Foreign Office, January 8th, 1834.No. 18.By Robert Fits-Roy, Commander of H.

Northwesterlywinds prevail, bringing clouds and rain in abundance.South-western succeed them, and partially clear the sky with theirfury ; then the wind moderates, and hauls into the south-eastquarter, where, after a short interval of fine weather, it dies away.Light airs spring up from the north-east, freshening as they veerround to north, and augment the store of moisture which they alwaysbring ; from the north they soon shift to the usual quarter, northwest,and between that point and south-west they shift and backsometimes for weeks before they take another round turn. Whenthe wind backs (from south-west to west-north-west, &c.), badweather and strong winds are sure to follow. On that coast windnever backs suddenly, but it shifts with the sin (with respect to thathemisphere) very suddenly, sometimes flying from north-west tosouth-west or south in a most violent squall. Before a shift of thiskind there is almost always an opening, or light appearance, in theclouds towards the south-west, which the Spaniards call an eye (jo),and for that signal the seaman ought to watch carefully. As thesudden shifts are always with the sun, no man ought to be takenaback unexpectedly ; for so long as a north-wester is blowing withany strength, accompanied by rain, so long must he recollect thatthe wind may fly round to the south-west quarter at any minute. Itnever blows hard from east ; rarely with any strength from northeast; but an occasional severe gale from south-east may be expected,especially about the middle of winter (June, July, August). In thesummer southerly winds last longer and blow more frequently thanthey do in winter, and the reverse. The winds never go completely164 Appendix.round the circle ; they die away as they approach east ; and after aninterval of calm, more or less in duration, spring up gi-actually betweennorth-east by east and north. Heavy tempests sometimesblow, from west-north-west to south-west ; and those winds blowingdirectly on shore are most to be guarded against. As to the tides,they are simple and uniform in the extreme. High water, at fuU andchange, takes place within half an hour of noon, from Valdivia toLandfall Island ; and the rise of tide is every where, on the outercoasts Within those limits, nearly the same, namely, from four toeight feet. In the offing no stream of tide is any where discernible,and even close to the land it does not exceed one knot, or at mosttwo knots an hour. On this extent of coast what Httle current isfelt, sets southward, except during or before strong or lasting southerlywinds : its influence is, however, but trifling, upon a ship outof soundings.* A heavy swell, from the westward, drives in upon allthe coast. A barometer is invaluable.No. 20.El President de la Republica de Chile, &c.El Senor Roberto Fits-Roy, commandant del buque de su Mages-tadBritannica Beagle ha recibido de su Gobierno el enlarge de reco-nicer estas Costs y levant maps de eUas ; y el Gobierno de Chiledesea franquear a una operation de tan conocida utihdad para lanavegacion y comercio, y para el adelantamiento de las ciencias,todas las facilitates y auxihos que de el dependant.

Vol. iv. p. 118, &c.Oct. 11th, 1681, they* were in latitude 49° 54' S., and estimatedtheir distance from the American coast to be 120 leagues. The windblew strong from the S.W. and they stood to the S.E. On themorning of the 12th, two hours before day, being in latitude byaccount 50° 50' S., they suddenly found themselves close to land-theship was iU prepared for such an event, the fore-yard havingbeen lowered to ease her, on account of the strength of the wind.The land was high and towering ; and here appeared many islandsscattered up and down." They were so near and .so entangled, thatthere was no possibility of standing off to sea ; and, with such lightas they had, they steered as cautiously as they could in between someislands and along an extensive coast, which, whether it was a largerisland, or part of the continent, they could not know. As the dayadvanced, the land was seen to be mountainous and craggy, and thetops covered with snow.The buccaneers under Sharp.APPENDIX. 17gSharp says, " we bore up for a harbour, and steered in northwardabout five leagues. On the north side there are plenty of harbours."At eleven in the forenoon they came to an anchor in a harbour inforty-five fathoms, within a stone's cast of the shore, where the shipwas land-locked and in smooth water. As the ship went in, one ofthe crew, named Henry Shergall, fell overboard as he was going intothe spritsail top, and was drowned ; on which account this was namedSherman's Harbour."The bottom was rocky where the ship had anchored ; a boat wastherefore sent to look for better anchorage. They did not, however,shift their berth that day ; and during the night, strong flurries ofwind from the hills, joined with the sharpness of the rocks at thebottom, cut their cable in two, and they were obliged to set sail.They ran about a mUe to another bay, where they let go anotheranchor, and moored the ship with a fastening to a tree on shore.They shot geese, and other \Adld-fowl. On the shores they foundlarge muscles, cockles like those in England, and limpets : here werealso penguins,* which were shy, and not taken without pursuit ; "theypaddled on the water with their wings very fast, but their bodieswere too heavy to be carried by the said wings." The first part ofthe time they lay in this harbour, they had almost continual rain.On the night of the 15th, in a high north wind, the tree to whichtheir cable was fastened gave way, and came up by the root, in consequenceof which, the stern of the ship took the ground and damagedthe rudder. They secured the ship afresh by fastening the cable toother trees ; but were obliged to unhand the rudder to repair.The 18th was a day of clear weather. The latitude was observed50° 40' S. The difference of the rise and fall of the tide was sevenfeet perpendicular : the time of high water is not noted. The armof the sea, or gulf, in which they were, they named the English Gulf ;and the land forming the harbour, the Duke of York's Island ; " moreby guess than any thing else ; for whether it were an island or continentwas not discovered."Ringrose says, " I am persuaded that the place where we now are,is not so great an island as some hydrographers do lay it down, butrather an archipelago of smaller islands. Our captain gave to themthe name of the Duke of York's Islands. Our boat which went eastwardfound several good bays and harbours, with deep water close tothe shore ; but there lay in them several sunken rocks, as there didSteamer ducks. Penguins swim like fish. — R. F.174 APPENDIX.also in the harbour where the ship lay. These rocks are less dangerousto shipping, by reason they have weeds lying about them."From all the preceding description, it appears that they were atthe south part of the island named Madre de Dios in the Spanishatlas ; which island is south of the channel, or arm of the sea, namedthe Gulf de la S""" Trinidad ; and that Sharp's English Gulf is theBravo de la Conception of Sarmiento.Ringrose has dra^^^l a sketch of the Dulce of York's Islands, andone of the English Gulf ; but which are not worth copying, as theyhave neither compass, meridian line, scale, nor soundings. He hasgiven other plans in the same defective manner, on which accountthey can be of little use. It is necessary, however, to remark a differencein the plan which has been printed of the English Gulf, fromthe plan in the manuscript. In the printed copy, the shore of thegulf is drawn in one continued line, admitting no thoroughfare ;whereas, in the manuscript plan, there are clear openings, leaving aprospect of channels through.Towards the end of October, the weather settled fair. Hithertothey had seen no inhabitants ; but on the 27th, a party went fromthe ship in a boat on an excursion in search of provisions, and unhappilycaught sight of a small boat belonging to the natives of theland. The ship's boat rowed in pursuit, and the natives, a man, awoman, and a boy, finding their boat would be overtaken, all leapedoverboard and swam towards the shore. This villanous crew of buccaneershad the barbarity to shoot at them in the water, and theyshot the man dead ; the woman made her escape to land ; the boy, astout lad about eighteen years of age, was taken, and with the Indianboat, was carried to the ship.The poor lad thus made prisoner had only a small covering of sealskin." He was squint-eyed, and his hair was cut short. The donee,or boat, in which he and the other Indians were, was built sharp ateach end and flat bottomed : in the middle they had a fire burningfor dressing victuals, or other use. Tliey had a net to catch penguins,a club like our bandies, and wooden darts. This young Indianappeared by his actions to be very innocent and foolish. He couldopen large muscles with his fingers, which our buccaneers coiddscarcely manage with their knives. He was very wild, and would eatraw flesh."By the beginning of November the rudder was repaired and hung.Ringrose says, " we could perceive, now the stormy weather wasAPPENDIX.blown over, much small fry of fish about the ship, whereof before wesaw none. The weather began to be warm, or rather hot ; and thebirds, as thrushes and blackbirds, to sing as sweetly as those mEngland."On the 5th of November, they sailed out of the English Gulf,taking-with them their young Indian prisoner, to whom they gavethe name of Arson. As they departed, the natives on some of thelands to the eastward made great fires. At six in the evening theship was without the mouth of the gulf : the wind blew fresh fromthe N.W., and they stood out S.W. by W., to keep clear of breakers,which lie four leagues without the entrance of the gulf to the S. andS.S.E. Many reefs and rocks were seen hereabouts, on account ofwhich they kept close to the wind till they were a good distance clearof the land. Their navigation from here to the Atlantic was, morethan could have been imagined, like the journey of travellers by nightin a strange country without a guide. The weather was stormy, andthey would not venture to steer in for the Strait of Magalhaens,which they had purposed to do, for the benefit of the provision whichthe shores of the strait afford, of fresh water, fish, vegetables, andwood. They ran to the S. to go round to the Tierra del Fuego, havingthe wind from the N.W., which was the most favourable for thisnavigation ; but they frequently lay to, because the weather was thick.On the 12th, they had not passed the Tierra del Fuego. The latitude,according to observation that day, was 55° 25', and the coursethey steered was S.S.E.On the 14th, Ringrose says, " the latitude was observed 57° 50' S.,and on this day we could perceive land, from which at noon we weredue W." They steered S. by E., and expected that at daylight thenext morning they should be close in with the land ; but the weatherbecame cloudy, with much fall of snow, and nothing more of it wasseen. No longitude or meridian distance is noticed, and it mustremain doubtful whether what they took for land was floating ice ;or their observation for the latitude erroneous, and that they saw theIsles of Diego Ramirez ?Three days afterwards, in latitude 58° 30' S., they feU in with iceislands, one of which they reckoned to be two leagues in circumference.A strong current set here southward. Tliey held on theircourse eastward so far, that when at last they did sail northward,they saw neither the Tierra del Fuego nor Staten Island. (End ofNovember 1681.)APPENDIX.No. 24 (a).Extract from the Voyage of Lionel Wafer in 1686, describing theIsland of Santa Maria, under the mistaken name of Mocha.The island afforded both water and fresh provision for our men.The land is very low and flat, and upon the sea coast sandy ; but themiddle ground is good mould, and produces maize, wheat, and barley,with variety of fruits, &c. Here were several houses belonging to theSpanish Indians, which were very well stored with dunghill fowl.They have here also several horses : but that which is most worthy ofnote, is a sort of sheep they have, which the inhabitants call ' cameronde tierra.' This creature is about four feet and a half high at the back,and a very stately beast. These sheep are so tame that we frequentlyused to bridle one of them, upon whose back two of the lustiest menwould ride at once round the island, to drive the rest to the fold.His ordinary pace is either an amble or a good hand-gallop ; nordoes he care for going any other pace during the time his rideris upon his back. His mouth is like that of a hare ; and the hare-lipabove opens as well as the maLa-hips, when he bites the grass, whichhe does verj^ near. His head is much like an antelope, but they hadno horns when we were there ; yet we found very large horns muchtwisted, in the form of a snail-shell, which we suppose they had shed ;there lay many of them scattered upon the sandy bays. His earsresemble those of an ass, his neck is small, and resembling a camel's.He carries his head bending and very stately, Hke a swan ; is full-chester,like a horse, and has his loins much like a well-shaped greyhound.His buttocks resemble those of a full-gro^-n deer, and he hasmuch such a tail. He is cloven-footed, like a sheep, but on the sideof each foot has a large claw, bigger than one's finger, but sharp,and resembling those of an eagle. These claws stand about twoinches above the division of the hoof; and they serge him m combingrocks, holding fast by whatever they bear against. His flesh eatsas like mutton as can be : he bears wool twelve or fourteen incheslong upon the belly ; but it is shorter on the back, shaggy, and alittle incHnmg to curl. It is an innocent and very serviceable beast,fit for any drudgery. Of these we killed forts-three ; out of the mawof one of which I took thirteen bezoar stones, of which some wereragged, and of several forms ; some long, resembling coral ; someAPPENDIX. 177round, and some oval, but all green when taken out of the maw ;yet by long keeping they turned of an ash colour."No. 25.By Robert FitzRoy, Captain of H.M.

More moderate, but wind still from the northward.At nine a.m. spoke the Blonde, on her way to the supposed place ofthe Lebu ; kept our wind, endeavouring to fetch Tucapel Head, wherewe had seen the fire three days before ; noon, Tucapel Point east-north-east,three-quarters of a mile distant ; observed two fires onTucapel Head ; tacked to the westward, to fetch the Head.At thirty minutes past two, Tucapel Point east-north-east, ninemUes ; while four men were aloft (James Bennett, gunner's mate.Beagle ; John Butcher, boatswain's-mate ; John Macintosh, A.B. ;John Mitchell, A.B., of Blonde), bending the fore-topsail, which hadbeen split the previous night, the vessel gave a very heavy pitch,which sprung the foremast, a little below the cross-trees ; and onher recovering herself, the head of the mast snapped short off, a footbelow the fore-yard, bringing with it aU above, and also the fourseamen who were aloft ; the mainmast, having no support left fromthe tragic stay, and the deck-stay being aft, ready for tacking, thegreat weight of the main-boom, added to the pressure of the windon the mainsail, brought the mainmast by the board, fore-and-aftthe deck, striking the affray in its fall, which again carried it away,leaving the head of the mast hanging by the rigging over the stern,striking heavy against the rudder and the middle-piece in midshipson the deck. Fortunately, none of the seamen were seriously injured,as they resolutely kept their hold of the topsail-yard, and were carriedwith it into the sea, out of which they soon escaped by means of therigging that was hanging over the side.Every effort was immediately used to clear the wreck, and getAPPENDIX. ' 181the temporary rigging up, to secure the stump of the foremast whichhad carried away the wedges in the partners, and had about threeinches play in the step, from the heel of the mast being decayed ;nearly the whole of the standing rigging was lost, from night comingon, and it being necessary to get the wreck clear of the vessel assoon as possible, lest it should carry away the rudder, and otherwisedamage the hull of the vessel.Not hasting an axe, or any thing but a cooper's drawing-knife, thatwould cut the rigging in the eyes, which had hide on them that hadbeen placed there several years before, we were obUged to haul it uptaut and cut on the rail, thereby rendering it useless for any thingbut junk.There were scarcely any nails on board the vessel ; and it waswith the greatest difficulty we succeeded, by shifting two cleats up aslippery mast, in getting a tackle each side for shrouds, and a hawserfor a stay. At eight, p.m., observed the Blonde north-west onemile ; fired a rocket, and burnt three blue lights ; no answer returned.At about midnight we set the jib, peak of foresail, and Beagle'sboat sail for a main sail ; during the whole of this time it was blowingfresh from the north-west, with heavy rain and a cross sea, whichcaused the vessel to roll her gunwale under each time ; every onewas quite exhausted, particularly those men who had been hangingon the mast, getting the tackles secured, the watch therefore was setuntil daylight.Tuesday, 30th. Employed getting the foremast better secured, byraising sheers vdth fore-yard and jib-boom, and placing a pair ofshrouds on each side, about twenty feet from the deck, and an extrastay to set a stay-sail on, the whole kept up by a few spikes di-awnout of the beams. At ten, a.m. strong winds from the westward, withheavy rain ; saw the north-west extreme of Mocha, bearing south-south-east,three miles distant ; wore to the north-east, to give timeto get more sail on the vessel, intending to weather the island, ifpossible ; if not, to run to leeward, and then stretch off to the southwardand westward. Noon ; wore, strong braids and squally, with aheavy head sea ; at two, set foresail, double-reefed ; observed the northwestextreme of Mocha, south by east, one mile and a quarter distant.At three, p.m., when the north-west extreme bore north-east,the wind changed suddenly to south-west, bringing the rocks off the182 APPENDIX.south-west extreme of the island about four points on the lee-bow ;but the wind increasing and giving the vessel more way, enabled herto pass about three-quarters of a mile to windward of the outerbreaker, on which the sea was breaking furiously ; the island itselfwas only visible at intervals, owing to the thickness of the weather,and constant, heavy rain.At five, the weather being a little clearer, saw the island, itscentre bearing north-east, four miles distant ; stood to the southwardduring the night, fresh breezes from south-west throughout.Wednesday, July 1st. Daylight, employed rigging the fore-yard asajury main-mast ; calm, with drizzling rain and a heavy swell ; bynoon got the jury main-mast up, and set fore stay-sail for a mainsail,secured the boat's mast to the taflrail, and set the sail for amizen. At five, a light air from the southward, stood to the westwardduring the night (no stars visible).Thursday, 2d. Strong winds from west-north-west ; stood to thesouth-west ; at thirty minutes past eight, observed a schooner west,standing to the northward ; hoisted the ensign union down in thefore-rigging ; but she passed within a mile to windward, and tookno notice of us. Noon, weather the same ; wore to north-west ; thirtyminutes past four, observed the land east-northeast, supposedCockle Head ; wore, and stood to the south-west ; fresh breezes andsqually, with rain at times ; no stars visible throughout the night.Midnight, wore to the northward.Friday, 3d. Moderate from the westward, with rain at times,employed setting up rigging and securing masts ; latitude observed(within a few miles) 39° 23' S.Repaired the Beagle's boat, which had been badly stove by thefall of the masts, as well as our means would allow. Moderate fromthe westward, until two, a.m., when the wind shifted to the northward; wore to the westward.Saturday, 4th. Moderate, ■wdth rain at times, wind north-west ;employed as most necessary, fitting grummets for sweeps, in case ofa calm, and being drifted near the land. Latitude observed nearly38° 40'. S. P.M. Employed as before ; at eight o'clock, wore to thenorthward ; moderate throughout the night.Sunday, 5th. Light winds from north-west, and fine clear weather ;employed repairing sails, chafes, &c. Latitude observed, 38° 35' S.At one, P.M., observed the island of Mocha, south extreme bearingAPPENDIX.

Strong breezes from south-south-east; at daylight,Tucapel Head north-north-east ; hauled up for it ; at ten, observeda vessel in shore ; but suddenly lost her, and could not again getsight of her.* Noon, Cicero Head east (true), distant ten miles;found a strong current setting along shore to the southward, with attimes a heavy ripple, until one, p.m., when it changed and set to thenorthward, and off-shore withal ; at six, Domino Rocks south-south-east,distant two miles ; steered north-east by north for the Paps ofBio Bio ; but found it necessary to haul up north-east, and latterlynorth-east half-east, owing to a strong current setting to the northwardand westward ; at thirty minutes past nine. Paps of Bio Biosouth-south-east, distant three miles ; and at two, a.m. (Tuesday,7th), the north point of Quiriquina bore south one cable distant;stood into the bay, hoping to fetch ' Tome,' there to anchor, unto thewind came more favourable for Talcahuano ; but the wind beingscant, were obliged to wear (as the vessel would not stay), therebylosing more than she gained on each tack. At eleven, saw H.M.S.Blonde coming dovsm to us ; at one, we were taken in tow by theBlonde, and carried into Talcahuano Harbour, at the south-west cornerof the bay of Concepcion ; and at midnight we anchored.A. B. Osborne, July 7th, 1835.No. 28.Winds and Weather.On the southern coasts of Chile, winds from the southward, orfrom the northward, prevail more than those from the west ; andvery much more than those few which come from the east.From south-south-east to south-west, and from north-west tonorth (magnetic) are the points whence the wind usually blows —with less or more strength, according to the time of year.During the summer months, or from September to March, southerlyThe Blonde, shut in by a point of land — R. F.184 APPENDIX.winds are prevalent, almost always. They are frequently strong inthe afternoon, and sometimes during a part of the night. Towardsmorning, and during the early part of the day, moderate winds,light breezes, or calms, are to be expected.Near the land, it is generally calm at night, excepting about onceor twice in a month, when the wind blows strongly from the southwarduntil about midnight. Occasional northerly winds are experienced,it is true, during the summer ; but they are usually so moderate,during that season, that they pass almost unheeded.About the end of March, the ' northers,' as they are called, beginto remind one that fogs, heavy and frequent rains, thick gloomyweather, and strong winds, often trouble the southern coasts ofChUe.During a part of March, and throughout April, May, and June,foggy weather is frequent ; and although it is not often that a thickfog lasts longer than a few hours, a day, even two days, of continuedthick fog, is not an unknown occurrence.With northerly and north-west winds the sky is overcast, theweather unsettled, damp, and disagreeable. These winds are alwaysaccompanied by clouds, and usually by thick rainy weather. Fromthe north-west the wind in general shifts to the south-west, andthence to the southward. Sometimes it flies round in a violentsquall, accompanied by rain, thunder, and lightning. At other timesit draws gradually round. Directly the wind is southward of west,the clouds begin to disperse, and as a steady southerly wind approaches,the sky becomes clear and the weather healthily pleasant.A turn of fresh southerly wind is usually followed by a moderatebreeze from the south-east, with very fine weather. Light variablebreezes follow, clouds gradually overspread the sky, and anotherround turn is generally begun by light or moderate north-easterlybreezes, with cloudy weather, and often rain.This is the general order of change. When the grind shifts againstthis order, or backs round, bad weather with strong wind may beexpected.Lightning is always a sign of bad weather. It accompanies or precedesa change for the worse ; which, however, is usually a prelude toclearing up. Squalls are rare, excepting at the shift from north-westto south-west, already mentioned. From the westward (south-westby west to north-west by west) the wind does not usually, if ever.APPENDIX. 185blow nearly so strong as from north-west to north, or from southwestto south.Currents.Near the island of Mocha, and to the westward of Cape Ruminateconsent usually runs to the north-west, from half-a-mile to onemile and a half, each hour. Distant in the ofRng, more than twentyor thirty miles from land, this set of current is so diminished that itis hardly sensible ; but near Mocha, and especially near the verydangerous out-lying rocks oiF the south and south-west extreme ofthat island, it is increased to two, and, at times, even three miles anhour.From the great river Bio Bio, and from other rivers in the vicinity,floods, escaping to seaward, often cause strong and irregular currentswhich set to the southward — passing the island of Santa Maria,sweeping round Point Lavapie, and Cape Rumena, and TucapelPoint — into the bay where his Majesty's ship Challenger was wrecked.These southerly currents are usually found to set strongly along-shore,but seldom reach an offing of six miles to the westward ofCape Rumena.A very intelligent Hanoverian, Anthony Vogelborg, employedduring several years upon these coasts, was once drifted in a smallvessel, from six miles south of the Paps of Bio Bio, to the rocksoif the north end of the Island of Santa Maria, in one night, duringa dead calm.After the great earthquake of the 20th of February, which affectedall the coast about Concepcion, and especially the Island of SantaMaria, the currents set to the south-eastward so strongly, that a boatbelonging to the above-mentioned Anthony Vogelborg (which he wassteering) running near the Island of Mocha, under sail, with a freshsoutherly breeze, could hardly make head against the strong streamthat was passing along shore from the north-westward. It is, therefore,to be apprehended, that the strength and direction of the currentsin the neighbouring ocean are unsettled and extremely uncertainfor some time after a serious earthquake.186 APPENDIX.No. 29,Santiago, 12 de Agosto de 1835.Senor :He instruct al President del contend de la carta de V.S. deayer, en que me include una copia de los resulted del viae de observationdel Capitan FitzRoy, de la frigate de S.M.B.

The high, or rather hilly exceptions, such asGambler, Osnaburgh, Pitcairn, Easter, &c. are few, in comparisonwith the seventy or eighty groups of islets which surround lagoons,besides many mere dry reefs.By far the larger number of the lagoon islands have at least oneharbour in each cluster accessible to shipping ; and a considerabletrade has been carried on with the natives for pearl oyster shells.What the number of inhabitants may be, who are dispersedthrough the Archipelago, it is exceedingly difficult to estimate, fortwo reasons : we know very little of them ; and they are migratory.From the little I have learned on the subject, I think they cannotbe less than ten thousand, nor more than thirty thousand, exclusiveof children.Fish, and shell-fish, hogs, and cocoa-nuts, are the principal subsistenceof the Low islanders ; but the natives of Gambler, and a fewother holy islands, have plenty of vegetable food in addition.Those Paamuto islands which are not very remote from Otaheite,affect to receive laws from her sovereign : they have, however, no residentauthority among them, except the head of each family.i» APPENDIX. 193The language of these islanders differs from that of the Ota-titans so much that they do not easily understand each other :yet I believe that both are radically the same. Taata is man, atOtaheite ; in Paamuto, Tanaka ; which is almost the same as Kanaka,the word for man in the Sandwich Islands ; and not very differentfrom Tanta in New Zealand. Some of the Low islanderssay their ancestors came from the south-eastern islands ; others sayfrom the Marquesas; again there are some who assert that theirforefathers arrived from islands to the westward : so that no reliancecan be placed upon the little yet known of their origin. Thereis, however, reason for supposing that the earlier inhabitants werenot of one family, or tribe ; but that they were emigrants from morethan one quarter.In most of the entrances to harbours in the lagoon islands, thereis a strong current of tide, which sets in and out alternately, aboutsix hours each way. The tide rises nearly two, or at most three,feet. It is high water at about one, on the days of fuU and new moon,among the western groups of islands, and from half an hour to an'hour later among those which lie towards the south-east. The currentswhich do not appear to be caused by tide are irregular ; and,as yet, too little is knovra of their usual direction to enable any oneto say more than that during settled weather, and a steady tradewind (south-easterly), the surface waters in general move westwardfrom five to twenty miles a day ; and that in the rainy season, fromOctober to March, when westerly pints, squalls, and rain are frequent,the currents vary most, and occasionally set eastward, at therate of from half a mile to two miles an hour.Numerous instances are upon record of canoes being drifted out oftheir course — even several hundred miles — by currents and westerlywinds : few narratives of voyages in the Pacific are without a noticeof them : and they materially assist in explaining how remote, andperhaps very small, islands, may have been first peopled from thewest : against the direction of the generally prevalent wind.No. 35.The British Resident at New Zealand, to His Britannic Majesty'sSubjects, who are Residing or Trading in New Zealand.The British Resident announces to his countrymen that he hasreceived from a person who styles himself "Charles, Baron de194 APPENDIX. ,Theory, sovereign chief of New Zealand, and king of Nuhahiva,"(one of the Marquesas Islands) a formal declaration of his intention toestablish in his own person an independent sovereignty in this country,which intention he states he has declared to their Majesties theKings of Great Britain and France, and to the President of theUnited States ; and that he is now waiting at Otaheite the arrivalof an armed ship from Panama, to enable him to proceed to the Bayof Islands with strength to maintain his assumed sovereignty.His intention is founded upon an alleged invitation given to himin England by Shanghai and other chiefs, none of whom as individualshad any right to the sovereignty of the country, and, consequently,possessed no authority to convey a right of sovereignty toanother. Also, upon an alleged purchase made for him in 1822, byMr. Kendall, of three districts on the Hokianga River, from threechiefs who had only a partial property in these districts, parts ofwhich are now settled by British subjects, by virtue of purchase fromthe rightful proprietors.The British Resident has also seen an elaborate exposition of theviews of this person, which he has addressed to the missionaries of theChurch Missionary Society, in which he makes the most ample promisesto all persons, whether whites or natives, who \\t11 accept hisinvitation to live under his government ; and in which he offers astipulated salary to each individual missionary in order to inducethem to act as his magistrates. It is also supposed, that he mayhave made similar communications to other persons or classes ofhis Majesty's subjects, who are hereby invited to make such communications,or any information on this subject they may possess,knovra to the British Resident, or to the additional British Residentat Hokianga.The British Resident has too much confidence in the loyalty andgood sense of his countrymen, to think it necessary to caution themagainst turning a favourable ear to such insidious promises. Hefirmly believes that the paternal protection of the British government,which has never failed any of his Majesty's subjects howeverremote, will not be withheld from them, should it be necessary toprevent their lives, liberties, or property, from being subjected to thecaprice of any adventurer, who may choose to make this country, inwhich British subjects have now by the most lawful means acquiredso large a stake, the theatre of his ambitious projects : nor, in theBritish Resident's opinion, will his Majesty, after having acknow-APPENDIX. 195ledged the sovereignty of the chiefs of New Zealand in their collectivecapacity, by the recognition of their flag, permit his humbleand confiding allies to be deprived of their independence upon suchpretensions.But, although the British Resident is of opinion that such anattempt as is now announced must ultimately fail, he, nevertheless,conceives, that if such a person were once allowed to obtain a footingin the country, he might acquire such an influence over thesimple-minded native as would produce effects which could not betoo much deprecated or too anxiously provided against ; and he hastherefore considered it his duty to request the British settlers of allclasses, to use all the influence they possess vsdth the natives ofevery rank, in order to counteract the efforts of any emissaries whichmay have arrived or may arrive amongst them : and to inspire bothchiefs and people with a spirit of the most determined resistance tothe landing of a person on their shores, who comes with the avowedintention of usurping a sovereignty over them.The British Resident will take immediate steps for calling togetherthe native chiefs, in order to inform them of this proposedattempt upon their independence, and to advise them of what is dueto themselves and to their country, and of the protection whichBritish subjects are entitled to at their hands. And he has no doubtthat such a manifestation will be exhibited of the characteristicspirit, courage, and independence of the New Zealanders as will stopat the outset such an attempt upon their liberties by demonstratingits utter hopelessness.James Busby,British Residency, at New Zealand, British Resident.Bay of Islands, 10th Oct. 1835.No. 36.Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand.1 . We the hereditary chiefs and heads of the tribes of the northernparts of New Zealand, being assembled at Waiting in the Bay ofIslands, on this 28th day of October 1835, declare the Independenceof our country ; which is hereby constituted and declared tobean independent state, under the designation of "The UnitedTribes of New Zealand."190 APPENDIX.2. All sovereign power and authority within the territories of theUnited Tribes of New Zealand is hereby declared to reside entirely,and exclusively, in the hereditary chiefs and heads of tribes in theircollective capacity : who also declare that they will not allow anylegislative authority separate from themselves in their collectivecapacity to exist ; nor any functions of government to be exercisedwithin the said territories, unless by persons appointed by them,and acting under the authority of laws regularly enacted by them incongress assembled.3. The hereditary chiefs and heads of tribes agree to meet incongress at Waiting, in the autumn of each year, for the purposeof framing laws for the dispensation of justice, the preservation ofpeace and good order, and the regulation of trade ; and they cordiallyinvite the southern tribes to lay aside their private animosities,and to consult the safety and welfare of our common country, byjoining the confederation of the United Tribes.4. They also agree to send a copy of this declaration to his Majestythe king of England, to thank him for his acknowledgment oftheir flag : and in return for the friendship and protection they haveshe^\^l, and are prepared to shew to such of his subjects as havesettled in their country, or resorted to its shores for the purposes oftrade, they entreat that he will continue to be the parent of theirinfant state, and that he will become its protector from all attemptsupon its independence.Agreed to unanimously on this 2Sth day of October 1835, in thepresence of his Britannic Majesty's Resident.Here follow the signatures, or marks, of thirty-five hereditarychiefs and heads of tribes, which form a fair representation of thetribes of New Zealand, from the North Cape to the latitude of theriver Thames.English witnesses,(Signed) Henry Williams, Missionary C.

and as the general rules by which it is thewish of this government that the British resident should regulate hisproceedings, should also guide you in cases in which you may feelyourself called upon to act —I am directed by his Excellency to transmit to you the enclosedextract of the instructions (13th April 1833) issued to Mr. Busby onhis departure to assume the duties of his office.By an adherence to the principles laid down in these orders, andtheir discreet application to circumstances, it is hoped that you willnot be disappointed in your expectation of being enabled to benefit198 APPENDIX.not only yourself, but others, and it will, his Excellency conceives,be unnecessary to do more than impress upon you the importance ofobtaining the objects you seek by a moral influence over chiefs andnatives.It should further be your particular study not only to act in concertwith the British resident, but to maintain with him that goodunderstanding which is necessary to give effect to your appointment,and to preserve the influence of both.The British resident will be requested to make known yourappointment to masters of vessels, and others resorting to New Zealand; and, on your arrival at your destination, you will take suchmeasures as your own experience, and that of any missionaries whomay be on the spot, may suggest as the best for apprising the Britishsettlers and the natives, of the nature of your office and objects.Upon this subject Mr. Busby, to whom I have the honour oftransmitting you a letter of introduction, will no doubt be able toafford you valuable information.The Secretary of State has intimated that you have disclaimedall desire of emolument in soliciting the appointment now conferredupon you.I have the honour to be.Sir,Your most obedient servant,(Signed) Alexander M' Lay,To Thomas M' Donne, Esq., Colonial Secretary.Additional British Residentat Hokianga, in New Zealand.No. 38.Extract from the Instructions of his Excellency, the Governor ofNew South Wales, to James Busby, Esq., British Resident atNew Zealand, dated 13th April 1833.To check as much as possible the enormities complained of, and togive encouragement and protection to the indisposed settlers andtraders from Great Britain and this colony, it has been thought properto appoint a British subject to reside at New Zealand, in anaccredited character, whose principal and most important duty it willAPPENDIX. 199be to conciliate the good will of the native chiefs, and establish upona permanent basis that good understanding and confidence which itis important to the interests of Great Britain, and of the colony, toperpetuate.It may not be easy to lay down any certain rules by which thisdesirable object is to be accomplished ; but it is expected, by theskilful use of those powers which educated man possesses over thewild or half-civilized savage, an influence may be gained, by whichthe authority and strength of the New Zealand chiefs wdl be arrangedon the side of the resident for the maintenance of tranquillitythroughout the islands.It will be fitting that you explain to the chiefs the object of yourmission, and the anxious desire of his Majesty to suppress, by yourmeans, the disorders of which they complain ; you will also announceyour intention of remaining among them, and will claim the protectionand privilege which you will tell them are accorded in Europeand America to British subjects, holding, in foreign states, situationssimilar to yours.You will find it convenient to manage this conference by means ofthe missionaries, to whom you will be furnished with credentials,and with whom you are recommended to communicate freely uponthe objects of your appointment, and the measures you should adoptin treating with the chiefs.The knowledge which the missionaries have obtained of the language,manners, and customs of the natives may thus become of serviceto you. Assuming, however, that your reception will be asfavourable as has been anticipated, I will endeavour to explain toyou the manner of proceeding, by which I am of opinion you maybest succeed in effecting the object of your mission ; you will at thesame time understand, that the information I have been able to obtainrespecting New Zealand is too imperfect to allow of my presentingyou with any thing more than a general outline for your guidance,leaving it for your discretion to take such further measures as shallseem needful, to arrest British subjects offending against British orcolonial laws in New Zealand.By the 9th of George IV., chap. 83, sec. 4, the Supreme Courtin New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land have power to enquireinto, hear and determine all offences committed in New Zealand, by200 APPENDIX.the master and crew of any British ship or vessel, or by any Britishsubject having there ; and all persons convicted of such offences maybepunished as if the offence had been committed in England. Thelaw having thus given the court the power to hear and determineoffences, it follows, as a necessary incident, that it has the power ofbringing before it any person against whom any indictment should befound, or information filed, for any offences within its jurisdiction.I would here observe, that I can propose no other means by whichyou can secure the offender, than the procuring his apprehension anddelivery on board some British ship, for conveyance to this country,by means of the native chiefs with whom you shall be in communication.It is well known, that amongst those Europeans who are leadinga wandering and irregular life at New Zealand, are to be foundtransported felons, and offenders, escaped from this colony and VanDiemen's Land. It is desirable that opportunities for the apprehensionand transmission of those convicts to either colony should bepromptly embraced.The chiefs are, it is said, well acquainted with the descriptions ofthe different Europeans residing in their country, and will be foundable and willing to point cut and secure, at a convenient time, thosewhom they know to be fugitives from the Australian colonies. Youwill be furnished from the office of the principal superintendant, withthe names and descriptions of those convicts from New South Waleswho are known or suspected to be concealed in the islands of NewZealand ; and you will use your discretion as to the fittest time forcausing their apprehension, and removal of such as may be within yourreach, or are guilty of any offence against the peace and tranquillityof the country. You vidll, of course, take every precaution to avoidthe apprehension of a free person in mistake for a convict, as anaction for damages would probably follow the commission of such aneditor.This government vsdll indeed be disposed to save you harmless inall such cases, where becoming circumspection has been used.When any of his Majesty's ships are off the coast, you will requestthe commander to receive the convict, or other person, arrested byyour means, for conveyance to this place.I would further observe, that, by means of the information whichyou are likely to receive from the chiefs, you may become acquaintedAPPENDIX. ^01with the criminal projects of Europeans before their execution ; andby a timely interference you may be able altogether to prevent theirmischievous designs, or render them abortive.In the character which you hold you will be justified in addressingany British subject, to warn him of the danger to which he may beexposed, by embarking or persevering in any undertaking of a criminalor doubtful nature.In the manner I have now described, and by proceedings of a similarcharacter, it may be possible to repress the enormities which haveheretofore been perpetrated by British subjects in New Zealand.It may also happen that this salutary control will not affect Britishsubjects only, but that the knowledge of there being a functionarystationed in New Zealand, through whom offences committed by thesubjects of any other State against the people of that country will bemade known to the British Government, and through that Governmentto the other European and American powers, may induce thesubjects of those powers to adopt a less licentious conduct towardsthe New Zealanders, and other inhabitants of the South Sea Islands.There is still another form in which the influence, it is hoped, theBritish Resident may obtain over the minds of the New Zealandchiefs, may be more beneficially exhibited.It is possible, by your official moderation, that the evils of intestinewar between rival chiefs or hostile tribes may be avoided, and theirdifferences peaceably and permanently composed. It is also possible,that at your suggestion, and by the aid of your councils,some approach may be made by the natives towards a settled form ofgovernment ; and that by the establishment of some system of jurisprudenceamong them, their courts may be made to claim the cognizanceof all crimes committed within their territory : and thus theoffending subjects, of whatever state, may be brought to justice by aless circuitous and more efficient process than any which I have beenable to point out.If, in addition to the benefits which the British missionaries areconferring on those islanders, by imparting the inestimable blessingsof Christian knowledge and a pure system of morals, the Zealandersshould obtain through the means of a British functionary, the institutionsof courts of justice, established upon a simple and comprehensivebasis, some sufficient compensation would seem to be renderedfor the injuries heretofore inflicted by our delinquent countrymen,u902 APPENDIX.Having thus explained to you, generally, the course of proceedingby which I think your residence in New Zealand may be made conduciveto the suppression of the enormities which British subjects, andthose of other states, have been in the habit of committing in theseislands, I have only further to observe, that it will be your duty toassist, by every means in your power, the commercial relations ofGreat Britain and her colonies with New Zealand. It would indeedbe desirable that you should become the medium of all communicationsbetween the New Zealand chiefs and the masters of British orcolonial vessels frequenting the coasts, and the merchants and settlersestablished in the islands. This arrangement will probably growout of your residence in the country, and you should keep it in viewas an important object. You will be pleased to forward by everyopportunity a shipping report, setting forth the names, masters,number of crew, tonnage, and countries, of vessels arriving at theBay of Islands, or other parts of New Zealand, whence you canobtain correct accounts ; with the cargoes of such vessels, theirobjects in touching at New Zealand, as far as you are informed ; andany other particular concerning them that may be worthy of notice.I beg to call your attention to the strange and barbarous traffic inhumanheads, which certainly did exist to some extent, but which, Iam given to understand, is now nearly abandoned. Should it befoimd to continue or revive, some legislative act may be necessary toprohibit, in this colony, the crime and disgrace of participating in sobrutalizing a commerce.Having already mentioned the assistance which I anticipate youwin receive from the missionaries, I have now only to impress on youthe dut' of a cordial co-operation with them in the great objects oftheir solicitude, namely, the extension of Christian knowledgethroughout the islands, and the consequent improvement in thehabits and morals of the people.Richard BOUEKE.No. 39.The modes of surveying coasts, where there is anchorage, andwater smooth enough to admit of boats being frequently employed,have been so often detailed, that, without repeating what is saidi;Q every treatise on the subject, I will only try to describe in thisAPPENDIX. 203place the methods adopted by the officers of the Beagle, in the examinationof a wild sea-coast — such, for example, as that of thesouth-western part of Tierra del Fuego.On that coast the weather was so continually bad, there was somuch swell, and the water near the steep precipitous shores alwaysso deep, that anchorage (except in harbours) was impracticable :boats were seldom able to assist (while under way), and the bearingcompass, though particularly good, and well placed, was of very littleuse : it was therefore never trusted in important bearings. Anotherimpediment, and not a slight one, was the current ; which set irregularlyfrom one knot to three knots an hour, along the shore.But there are seldom evils, unbalanced by remedies. The stormyand desolate shores of Tierra del Fuego are broken into numerousislands, about which anchorages are abundant, and they are excellent,when once a vessel is in them. To find, and enter, or leavethem in most instances, was troublesome, and often dangerous. But,with the help of those havens, and the distinct marks afforded by ahigh rocky shore ; and by the sharp peaks of more distant heights,a correct survey was effected.Beginning at the western extreme, near Cape Pillar (because theprevailing winds are westerly, and the current sets to the eastward),our first object was to find a safe harbour in which to secure theship. There we made observations for latitude, time, and true bearing; on the tides, and magnetism. We also made a plan of theharbour and its environs ; and translations, including all thevisible heights, and more remarkable features of the coast, so far asit could be clearly distinguished from the summits of the highesthills near the harbour. Upon these summits a good theodolite wasused, which was set, invariably, to a well-defined mark, near theobservatory ; from which mark the true bearings of the stationson the summits of the hills were ascertained by observations of thesun made with a theodolite.Many leagues of exposed, and difficult coast, were looked downupon, in this manner ; and, at the least, their exact bearings fromone fixed spot ascertained. But if more than one height afforded around of angles with the theodolite, and the position of each ofthose heights was accurately known by triangulation dependingupon a base measured at the harbour, then the positions of variousother hills or marks were ascertained ; and so much easier became204 APPENDIX.the sea work afterwards executed in the ship. I need hardly alludeto the facilities, afforded by heights, for making eye sketches of thecoast line, and other details, such as the ranges of lulls, forms ofbanks, &c. Ascending heights near the sea is advantageous in anotherpoint of view ; for not a rock or a shallow escapes notice, if theday is tolerably clear. While in harbour, every place in the vicinitywhich could be examined in boats, or overland excursions, was explored,as far as our means and time would allow.Before I speak of the sea-work, it may be useful to say a wordabout ' bases of four kinds, arranged according to their relativevalue.The first are those derived from good astronomical or chronologicalobservations, made at two stations several mUes apart.The second are deduced from angular measurements of smallspaces exactly known.The third are obtained by actual measurement with a chain, withrods, or with a line : —And the fourth are the rather uncertain bases obtained by sound.This statement of the relative value of bases, is only meant to referto their employment in sea-surveying. I need hardly remind thereader of these notes, that the third description of bases, howeverexact nominally, requires a host of minute precautions, in additionto what I never found between Valdivia and Cape Horn, namely, anearly level and accessible space, of considerable length, on which tomeasure.To attain the utmost precision is a laudable endeavour, no doubt,when carrying on extensive trigonometrical operations on land ; butit should be borne in mind, that every hour employed in what iscommonly called ' hair-spitting' — in minute details that do not affectthe chart or plan which is the result of a sea-survey, is not only anhour lost, but an hour taken away from useful employment.The second kind of bases are so quickly and easily measured, eitherwith a sextant or micrometer, across any kind of land or water, andhave been so repeatedly proved in every part of the Beagle's surveys,that I consider them unobjectionable, when used for such limitedoperations as making plans of harbours, or fixing the positions ofobjects only a few miles distant. By multiplying bases, which withsuch easy methods is soon effected ; and by a frequent use of thesextant, artificial horizon, and chronometer, material errors may beAPPENDIX. 205kept out of the work of a practised surveyor. With a sextant, horizon,and chronometer (in a sheltered spot), a micrometer and board,*a theodolite, and intelligent assistants, much work may be done in ashort time.When ready to proceed, the chronometer rates being ascertained,and the weather glasses affording reasonable hope of a day or twowithout a gale of wind, we started at day-light, and worked againsttime. Those officers who were engaged particularly with the survey,did not take part in the routine duties of the vessel. One attendedto the bearing compass, and usually wrote the various angles andbearings, taken by others as well as himself, in a bearing-book.Another officer took angles. A third attended to the ship's course, thesoundings, and the patent log. When many angles were required atonetime, or when observations for time, latitude, or true bearing,were made while taking a round of angles, other officers assisted.If the bearing compass was steady enough it was used, evenwhen true bearings were obtained ; or when, if cloudy, the triangulationwas carried on by points fixed from the last harbour. As thecompass was so placed as to be uninfluenced by local attraction,the bearings it gave, when steady, were satisfactory ; yet it wasnever trusted implicitly ; nor at all in matters of consequence. Itsuse was as an auxiliary ; not as a principal. Bearings, or angles, ofthe highest points, or of marks so well defined as not to be mistakenin consequence of a change of the place of an observer, were,of course, always selected, if such were visible : and vertical anglesof all notable heights were not omitted.For the sake of perspicuity, we considered that positions, fixedpoints, or marks, were separated into three classes. In the firstclass, were obsen^atories or places at which the latitude, longitude,and true bearing, were accurately ascertained ; besides those highpeaks, or other well-defined objects which could be seen at a distanceof some leagues, and whose exact places were known by atriangulation which connected them with an observatory ; and thehighest points of islands, which were neither low, nor small enoughfor the eye to overlook them at the first glance.A board some feet long, painted black on one side, white on theother; exactly measured, and suspended horizontally, at right angles tothe observer.206 APPENDIX.In the second class we considered all the minor fixed pointswhich were included in the triangulation, excepting the details of thecoasts and ' boundary lines'* which belonged to the third class.We supposed that the ship had sailed from the ' first' harbour. f Atsix, in the morning, (marked 6) the position of the vessel was fixedby two or more angles between marks, already fixed, upon the land.At 6'30, and at 7 similar means were used to fix the ship's place.Soundings were taken, and laid down by proportioning to the timesof each sounding, the portions of distances run between the twostations, as shewn by patent log, by bearings of a mark, such as6 (in the figure) while sailing from 6 30 to 7 : by independentdouble angles, (two angles between three marks), orliy simple cross-bearings.Transit bearings were always sought for, by compass as well as bynoting when marks were ' on ;' or, in a line, one with another, withoutreference to the compass. We endeavoured to ascertain (or fix)the ship's position at the same moment, by the most available of thenumerous methods so readily occurring Mobile the log was going, thetime noted carefully (as often as angles or bearings were taken),and several first class marks in sight. Transit bearings were usefulin the details of the coast line, as may be seen by the lines dra^vnfrom 6-30, 7 and 8 ; and they corroborated the correctness of thetriangulation, when applied to first and second class marks.By a judicious selection of objects, and a clever application oftransit bearings, I have seen extensive and correct translationscarried on from data, obtained at sea, which appeared utterly inadequate.| I do not imply that the absolute position of any onepoint was independently correct, because all depended at first uponobservations at sea ; but that the points of the triangulation were allso correct, relatively, that, upon after examination, when the regularroutine of harbour work had been combined with the data obtainedafloat, and their truth ascertained by connection with the previousobservatory, no alteration was found necessary.Perhaps I should explain, that in the plan of the ' first ' harbourall depended upon the base Ab ; by which also were fixed B and C.From the summits B and C ; — G, D, E, F, were fixed, as well as aBy ' boundary lines ' [ mean limiting outlines of shoals, or rockyplace?. f See figure, t By Mr. Stokes.7^.Oji.s£HrATIOJ\rS 6'.V" SIIORi: AT Ao/i o/i.si-uiiA'iiiny at^IojiSMjuiirojn.rr /.nfilibliahtdly/'Heray CcdbumU.Gjeat ilaTLboroxi^ 3+wat.]6S9APPENDIX. 207number of inferior marks ; by a ' round ' of angles taken with atheodolite, at each station (B and C), the instrument being in eachcase set to A. From A, the true bearings of B and C were ascertainedastronomically. When the position of L was exactly determined bylatitude, and distance from the meridian of A, the long and accuratebase AL became known. With that, as a foundation, the workwas laid down : and by that base, if necessary, the former positionsof G, D, E, and F, were corrected. But so well did angular measuresanswer, that it was scarcely ever requisite to make such corrections.It has been shewn that the log served only to place soundings, orhelp to fill up a space, while clouds obscured marks. I should addthat it was serviceable in ascertaining the direction and strength ofcurrents. Currents altering in strength, as well as in direction,prevented our applying the patent log to other uses, although wehad every reason to put implicit confidence in its indications, andhave often proved their value in the still waters of a deep sound,where no stream of tide or current, existed : as well as in harbours,where angular bases were measured for the special purpose. Viewsof the lands, both in plan and profile, were very frequently taken.When boats could be lowered, and a sufficient object demanded theiremployment (as at 11, of the first day, and at 10 of the second day)they did not hang idly at their davits.In the example I have given, circumstances conspired in ourfavour, a rare event in Tierra del Fuego, or on any similar coast,exposed to the prevailing westerly winds of high latitudes ; but whenwe failed to find anchorage, the triangulation was carried on by firstclass marks ; and by the ship's positions, when fixed by good observationsat sea. But however well such a method may answer in a fineclimate— on that coast it was in general unsatisfactory, and veryinferior to that of going from one harbour to another.Among many kinds of notation useful in surveying, the annexedsketch shews a method used by Mr. Stokes, which I had not thenseen adopted. It is very convenient, and assists the memory morethan any other. In figure 2, A and B are stations, at which theangles specified were taken right and left of a mark, whose bearingwas ascertained. Or, the angles only were taken, and the trianglesafterwards calculated, or protracted, by reference to the base uponwhich they depended, such as AB. A sketch on this principle, .ever slightly made, brings the place to mind in an instant, andavoids any necessity for names* or letters.No. 40.Nautical Remarks on the Northern Coast of Chile.Scarcely any extensive coast less requires particular descriptionthan that of Chile. With a tolerable chart, and the lead going, astranger may san into, or out of, almost any Civilian port without hesitation.As there are, however, some anchorages and landing-placeshitherto little known, except to coasters, it may be useful to givea few notices of them.Valparaiso, and the ports southward, have been described so often,that I will not occupy any of these crowded pages with remarks onsuch well-known places ; although in another publication, strictlynautical, they will appear.QuiNTERO, Horton, and Papudo, have no hidden dangers. The twoformer lie to the southward and northward, respectively, of a stragglingcluster of black rocks, above water : the first is now little frequented,being rather shallow, and out of the way : the second is asummer roadstead, with a good landing-place, and easy communicationthence to Puchancavi. Papudo is a small open bay, with a goodlanding-place. Northerly winds throw in a heavy swell. Its situationis pointed out by a high, peaked hill, called Gobernador, immediatelyover the port.Pichidanque, sometimes called Herradura, has a rock near themiddle, on which, at low tide, there are but fifteen feet of water : itis in a line between the north end of the little island in front of theharbour, and a gully at the north-east side, through which a river runsfrom Quilimari, and four cables' lengths from the island. The tiderises five feet, and syzygial high water is at nine. The Silla, overPichidanque, I have already mentioned Cp. 426).Conceal is an exposed roadstead, seldom used but by smugglers.The landing is everywhere bad, excepting in one little cove at thenorth side of the bay.• Short characteristic names are preferable to letters, or numbers,because they' help the memory so much.APPENDIX. 209Maytencillo is a little cove, fit only for a boat to land in atparticular times.The next opening in this high rugged coast is that of the riverLiMARi, which looks large from seaward, but is inaccessible. Thecoast near Limari is steep and rocky. Two miles from the entranceof the river, there is a low, rocky point, with a small beachon which boats sometimes land ; but a heavy surf breaks on it. Near amile from the coast the land rises suddenly to a range of hills, aboutone thousand feet high, which runs parallel to the coast, and extendstwo or three miles north and south of the river ; the summits of thehills to the northward are covered with wood. The north entrancepoint is low and rocky ; the south is a steep slope, with a remarkablewhite sandy patch on the side of it. The river at its mouth is abouta quarter of a mile wide ; but the surf breaks heavily right across ;inside it turns a little to the north-east, and then runs to the eastwardthrough a deep gully in the range of hiUs before-mentioned.Moist Tahnay is a remarkable hiU, 2,300 feet hiUgh ; it is threemiles from the coast, and seven miles southward of the river ; it isthickly wooded on the top ; the sides are quite bare. Ten mUessouthward of Mount Talinay lies a deep valley, with a remarkablesandhill on its north side, close to the coast ; at the mouth of thevalley there is a small sandy beach. Within five miles of Maytencillothere is a point with several rocks, miming oiF it about a quarter of amile ; from which to Maytencillo the coast is composed of blue rockycliffs, about one hundred and fifty feet high ; the land above thecliffs rises to between three and four hundred feet ; and then aboutthree miles in shore the range of hills runs from three to four thousandfeet high.About fourteen miles northward of Limari is a small bay, with asandy beach in the north corner ; but a heavy surf. From this baynorthward the coast is rocky and much broken : about eight milessouthward of Point Lengua de Vaca is a small rocky peninsula, witha high, sharp rock in the centre of it, southward of which Les asmall, deep cove, vdth a sandy beach at the head ; but the entranceis nearly blocked up by small islets, and rocks both above and belowwater. The entrance is too bad for the smallest vessel ; though in fineweather boats can land in the cove. The outer breaker is not morethan two cables from the shore ; but when calm the swell setsdirectly on it. This cove is Tortoral de Lengua de Vaca.210 APPENDIX.Point Lengua de Vaca is a very low, rocky point, rising graduallyin- shore to a round hummock, about a mile to the southward of thePoint. There are rocks nearly awash about a cable's length fromthe Point, and at two cables' lengths distant there are but five feet.After rounding Point Lengua de Vaca, the coast runs to the southeast,and is rocky and steep for about two miles from the Point,where there are fifteen fathoms about half a mile from the shore.About three miles from the Point, a long, sandy beach commences,which extends the whole length of the large bay as far as the islandor peninsula of Tongoy. The south part of the beach is called Play ade Tanque, the north and north-east side of the bay Playa de Tongoy.Off the south-west extreme of the beach there is anchorage abouthalf a mile from the shore, in from five to seven fathoms ; the bottomis a soft, muddy sand in some places, but in others it is hard.With a southerly wind it is very smooth, and the landing is verygood, but a heavy sea sets in with a northerly breeze. This is ananchorage that was once frequented by American whalers. The village,which is called the Rincon de Tanque, consists of about a dozenranchos.' The only water to be got is brackish ; about two miles anda half to the E.N.E.* where there is good water, the landing is generallyvery bad, and the water is some distance from the beach.From Tanque to the peninsula of Tongoy there is anchorage inany part of the bay, at from one to two miles from the shore, in fromseven to ten fathoms, sandy bottom. There is good anchorage witha northerly wind for small vessels, to the southward of the peninsula,abreast of the small village on the Point, with the outer Point bearingW.N.W. in four fathoms sandy bottom, with clay underneath it ;but no vessel, however small, should go into less than four fathoms,as the sea breaks a little inside that depth when blowing hard fromthe northward. Large vessels would also find a little shelter withthe wind to the northward of north-west. With a strong southerlybreeze a vessel would not be able to remain at anchor to the southwardof the peninsula ; but there is a small b \j on the north side,which is completely sheltered from southerly winds. In the southeastcorner of this bay there is a small creek, into which, whensmooth, boats can go ; it runs about a mile inland, and near the headthere is fresh water for which the whalers sometimes send their boats.All bearings are magnetic, unless otherwise specified.APPENDIX. 211The village of Tongoy consists of half a dozen small houses, builton a high point at the south side of the peninsula.The coast on the west side of Huanaquero Hill is broken androcky, affording no shelter for any thing but a boat ; to the northwardthere is a deep bay, well sheltered from southerly and westerlywinds, but open to the northward : between this and Port Herradurathere is no place fit for a vessel.Herradura and Coquimbo are well known. Beatings is a boldrugged point, the land behind it rising in ridges, which graduallybecome higher as they recede from the coast to Copper Hill,which is 6,400 feet high. The point which makes as the northextremity of the bay, in coming from the northward, is a low rockypoint, called Porto ; about four miles to the northward of PointPorto, is the port of Arrayed, or Juan Soldan ; but it does notdeserve the name : it is merely a small bight behind a rocky point,scarcely affording shelter for a boat from southerly winds, and entirelyopen to northerly. A little to the northward of Copper Hill isanother hiU, on the same range and about the same height : thenorth side of the hill is steep, and at the foot of it is the small Bayof OsoRNO, which is about half a mile long, but not deep enough toafford any shelter for the smallest vessel. About half a mile to thenorthward of the bay there is a hamlet, consisting of a few smallhouses, called Yerba Buena.The Pajaros Islands are two low rocky islands, lying abouttwelve miles from the coast ; the northern is much smaller than thesouthern, and, as far as could be seen from the shore, there is nodanger round or between them. A little to the northward of YerbaBuena there is a small island, called Trigo, separated from the shoreby a channel about a cable's length broad ; but it is only fit for boats ;the island, except when very close, appears to be only a projectingpoint ; there is a large white rock on the west point of it.About three miles to the northward of Trigo Island, is the Portof ToRTORALiLLO, which is formed by a small bay facing the north,with three small islands off the west point. In coming from thesouthward, the best entrance for small vessels is between the southernmostisland and the point, where there is a channel about a cable'slength wide, with from eight to twelve fathoms water. The dry rockoff the point on the main land, should not be approached nearer thanhalf a cable, as a sunken rock lies nearly that distance from it. There212 APPENDIX.is no channel between the northern and middle islet, as it is blockedby breakers : a vessel may anchor about half a mile from any part ofthe beach in from six to eight fathoms, sandy bottom. The landingis not good, the best is on the rocks near the entrance ; but nothingcould be embarked from there : the east end of the beach is the bestfor that purpose. From the land to the northward, running so farwestward, it is not Hkely that a heavy sea would be caused by anortherly gale.Temblador is a small cove in the east side of TortoraliUo, butthe landing there is worse than on the other beach, and it is not sowell sheltered.About three miles to the northward of TortorahUo, there is thesmall island of Chungunga ; it is about a mile from the shore, andis a good mark for knowing the port : there is a rocky point a-breastof it ; a little in-shore of which there is a remarkable saddle hill,with a nipple in the middle, which, to a person coming from thesouthward, appears as the extreme of the high range, that runsthence to the eastward of TortoraliUo, and is from two to threethousand feet high.A little to the northward of Point Chtmgunga, there is a largewhite sand-patch, which is seen distinctly from the westward ; it isat the south end of the Chores beach, which runs for seven or eightmiles to the north-west, to Point Chores ; a heavy surf always breaksUpon it.Off Point Chords there are three islands, the inner one is lowand nearly joins the shore ; nothing but a boat can pass inside it.About a mile to the westward of this island, there is another smallisland ; between them the channel is clear of danger. To the southwestof this island about a mUe, is the largest of the Choros islands ;it is about a mUe long, the top is very much broken, and at thesouth-west end it very much resembles a castle : there is a smallpyramid off the south end, and rocks break about a quarter of a milefrom the shore. The channel between the two outer islands is clearof danger ; but about half a mUe to the westward of the small island,there is a rock nearly awash. Five miles to the south-east of thesouthern Choros Island, there is a very dangerous reef of rocksonly a little above the water.Point Carrisal is a low rocky point, about five miles to the northwardof Point Choros, with a remarkable round hummock ; to theAPPENDIX. 213southward of it is the small cove of Polillao, where there is shelterfor small vessels, but the landing is bad : there are two small rockyislets off the south point of the cove. To the northward of PointCarrisal is the bay of the same name, but it is not fit for vessels ; atthe bottom of the bay a heavy surf breaks about half a mile from theshore. The north side of the bay is formed by a rocky point, withoutlying rocks and breakers about a quarter of a mile off all sides ofit. There is a landing-place in the bay, near the south-east corner,where the rocky coast joins the beach, but in bad weather the surfbreaks outside it.Nearly one mile to the northward of the north point of CarrisalBay is the Port of Chaneral ; it is well sheltered from northerlyand southerly winds, but the swell sets in heavily from the southwest,which makes the landing bad ; the best is in a small cove onthe north side of the port, near the beach at the head of it : there isalso a landing-place on the south side, but it is bad when there isany swell. On the beach at the head of the port there is always toomuch surf to land, except after very fine weather. About four milesand a half to the westward of it is the Island of Chaneral ; it is nearlylevel, except on the south side, near which there is a remarkablemound %vith a nipple in the centre of it. Tliere are rocks nearly halfa mile from the south point of the island, and one about the samedistance off the north-west point. On the north side there is a smallcove, where boats can land with the wind from the southward ;there is anchorage close off it, but the water is deep. An Americansealing schooner was lost there a few years ago, from a northercoming on while she was at anchor.The land round Chaneral is low, with ridges of low hUls runningfrom the points, the tops of which are very rugged and rocky, andthe land is sandy and very barren ; the range of high hiUs is severalmiles from the shore at this part, but between the range and coastthere are several smaller hiUs rising out of the low land. The villageof Chaiieral is about three naples from the port, and is said toconsist of about twenty houses. There are no houses near the port.We were told by some of the people that came off, that the onlyvessel that had ever been here was a small schooner, called the Constitucion(our vessel), which had taken a cargo of copper to Huasco.There was a large quantity of copper, said to belong to Mr. Edwards,ready to be embarked.214 APPENDIX.To the northward of Chaneral Bay the coast is low, and projectsto the N.W. for about ten miles. The extreme west point. PointPajaros, has a small rocky islet off it, about two cables from theshore : the land in-shore rises gradually to a low ridge, about halfa mile from the coast, the high range is about three miles in-shore.To the northward of Point Pajaros the coast runs to the East, forminga small bay, open to northerly, but well sheltered from southerlywinds ; there is anchorage in from eight to twelve fathoms, aboutone-third of a mile from the shore, but the landing is bad.About four miles Nee. of Point Pajaros is another point, with a highrock off it, to the northward of which is the Bay of Sarco, inwhich there is also shelter from southerly winds. A deep gully runsinland from the S.E., corner of the bay, at the mouth of which is asandy beach, with anchorage about one-third of a mile off, in fromeight to twelve fathoms, but the landing is not good. There aretwo or three small huts close to it. To the northward of Sarco thehigh land runs close to the coast, the sides of the hills are coveredwith yellow sand, the summits are rocky, and the whole coast has amiserably barren, appearance. To the northward of the deep gullyabout four miles, there is a projecting rocky point, at the foot of ahigh range of hills, with a very remarkable black sharp peak nearits extreme, the coast to the northward of this runs nearly northand south, and is very rocky for about eight miles, when it turns tothe westward, forming a deep bay, in the Nee. comer of which is asmall beach called Tongoy. To the northward of the bay a highrange runs out towards Point Alcalde, the extreme point of the bay,which is nearly seven miles to the southward of Huasco ; the point isvery rocky with small detached rocks close to it : in-shore it rises alittle, and there are several small rocky lumps, running out of thesand, one of which, from the southward, shows very distinctly : itis higher than the rest, and forms a sharp peak ; a little in-shore ofwhich the land rises suddenly to the extreme of the high range.About seven miles to the northward of Point Alcalde, is the pointforming the Port of Huasco, it is a low rugged point, with severalislands off it, one of which only is of any size, it is separated fromthe main by a very narrow channel, and appears from sea-ward to bethepoint of the main ; it is covered with low rugged rocks, one ofwhich on its north side is much higher than the rest, and showsdistinctly coming from the southward, but from the northward it isAPPENDIX. 215noised with the other rocks behind it ; to the south-west of thisisland there are several other small rocky islets, which appear astwo small islands when seen from a distance. A little in-shore ofthe extreme point there is a short range of low hUls, forming fourrugged peaks, which show very distinctly from the southward andwestward : the land falls again inside them for a short distancemore, and then rises suddenly to a high range running east andwest, which is directly to the southward of the anchorage. Thetop of the range forms three roimd summits, the easternmost ofwhich is a little higher, and the middle a Httle lower than the other.Nearly three miles to the Nee. of the anchorage, there is anotherrange of hills about 1 ,400 feet high : on the south slope of whichthere is a sharp peak, from which it slopes to the valley that theriver runs through. The river is small, and a heavy surf breaksoutside it, the water however is excellent ; there is another lagoonsmall river in the valley, near-er the port, but the water is verybrackish. The anchorage is very much exposed to northerly winds,and a heavy sea then rolls in, but a heavy norther does not occurmore than once in two or three years. The village consists of abouta dozen small houses, scattered among the rocks on the pointdividing the old and new ports. The country roved presents amore barren and miserable appearance than any part even of thisdesolate coast : the ground is composed of a mass of small stonesmixed-with sand, out of which project masses of rugged, craggyrocks. A Httle in-shore the stony ground is changed for a looseyellow sand, which covers the sides and bases of nearly all the hillsround : the summits are stony without any appearance of vegetation; but in the low grounds a few stunted bushes grow among thestones, and after rain (a rare blessing) they look much fresher thanmight be expected in such soU, and then the valley through whichthe river runs also appears green, forming a striking contrast tothe country around.Point Lobo, about ten miles to the northward of Huasco, isrugged, with several small hummocks on it ; to the southward ofthis there are several small sandy beaches with rocky points betweenthem, but a tremendous surf breaks on them, allowing no sheltereven for a boat. A little in-shore of the point, there are two lowhills, and within them the land rises suddenly to a range about1,000 feet high. In the bay to the northward of Point Lobo, there216 APPENDIX.are several small rocks, and about six miles from it there is a reefwhich runs perhaps half a mile off a low rocky point : the outer rockis high and detached from the others.About eleven miles to the northward of Point Lobo, is a very-ruggedpoint, with several sharp peaks on it, about half a mile tothe northward of which is the small port of Herradura, which canhardly be distinguished till quite close to it. Off the rugged point,and between it and the entrance to Herradura. there are outlyingrocks and breakers, about a quarter of a mile from the shore : offthe south entrance point there is a patch of low rocks, which incomingfrom the southward appear to extend right across themouth of the port. The entrance faces the N.W., and is betweenthis low patch of rocks, and a small islet to the Nee. of it : there isno danger within half a cable of either point. The port runs inabout three-quarters of a mile to the eastward of the islet, and issheltered from both northerly and southerly winds, but with astrong northerly breeze a swell rolls in round the islet. It is rathersmall for large vessels, and they would not be able to he at singleanchor in the inner part of the cove, but there is quite room enoughto moor across it. about a quarter of a mile above the islet, in fourfathoms, fine sand. In this place an American ship, the Nile, of420 tons, was moored during a northerly gale, which blew very heavily; and she was perfectly sheltered. The landing is better than inany place between it and Coquimbo : but there is a very seriousinconvenience in the want of water. There is a small lagoonabout a mile from this place, in the valley at the head of CarrisalCove, but it is worse than brackish ; yet the ' penes,' whoare at work shipping the ore, make use of it. A deep valley runsin from the head of the cove, separating the high ranges of hills,and is a good mark to know it by. The range to the southward of thevalley is the highest near the coast, and is distinctly seen from boththe northward and southward ; there is a small nipple in the highestpart of it. Carrisal is a small cove about a mile to the Nee. ofHerradura, well sheltered from southerly winds, but as it is so closeto Herradura, which is so much superior, it is not likely to be ofmuch use.To the northward of Carrisal the coast is bold and rugged, withoutlying rocks a cable's length off most of the points. About ninemiles to the northward of Herradura there is a high point with aAPPENDIX. 217round hummock on It, and several rugged hummocks a little inshore.To the northward of this there is a cove, sheltered from thesouthward, where small vessels may anchor, but it is not fit forlarge vessels ; there is another cove similar to it about a mile to thenorthward of it. A Httle to the northward of the second cove, thereis a high rocky point, which is the termination of the high part ofthe coast ; to the northward of the point there is a small port, whichfrom the chart appears to be Tortoralillo : it is well sheltered fromsoutherly winds, and the landing is good. In the inside part of it avessel, not drawing more than ten or twelve feet, might moor shelteredfrom northerly winds, in three and four fathoms, but with anortherly wind there would be a heavy swell in : there is anchoragefarther out under the point, in from eight to ten fathoms ; but a vesselshould not go nearer the shore than eight fathoms, as the bottominside is rocky.During the summer months this would be a very good port forsmall merchant vessels ; but there is no appearance of water near.Abreast of it the high range of hills recedes from the coast, whichis low, with some low rocky hills a little in-shore.About two miles to the northward of Matamores there is a lowrocky point, a little to the northward of which there is a small deepbay, at the mouth of a valley, in which, apparently, there is anchoragefor a vessel ; but there was a heavy surf on the beach, andas the landing was bad we did not wait to examine it. To thenorthward of this the low hills are not so rocky, but are coveredwith yellow sand, except near the summits, where they are stony.About six miles to the northward of this bay there is a remarkablerocky point, with a detached white rock off it, and a lump with anipple on it, a little in-shore. About half a mile to the northwardof this, is the small port of Pajonal, which, in coming from thesouthward, may be easily known by this nipple, and a small island,with a square topped lump in the centre of it, which is off the pointto the northward of the port. A range of hUls, higher than anynear, rises directly from the north side of the port ; and in the valley,about a mUe from it, there is a range of small and very ruggedMils rising out of the low land.The anchorage is better sheltered from southerly winds than anyto the southward, except Herradura, and there would not be muchswell, as the point and island to the northward project considerably218 APPENDIX.to the westward. The southerly swell rolls into the mouth of theport, but on the south shore it is smooth, and the landing pretty-good: there is a dangerous breaker about a quarter of a mile to thesouth-west of the south extreme point, which only shows whenthere is much swell. The best anchorage is about half way up thecove, near the south shore, in five fathoms : near the head it is veryflat. We found a cargo of copper ore ready to be shipped here, butno vessel had ever been in the port : there is no water within twomiles, and there it is very bad indeed. The name of Pajonal wastold to us by a young man who was getting the ore down, but heappeared to know scarcely anything of the coast, and there were noinhabitants near the place.About a mUe and a half to the northward of the island beforementioned, there is another point, with an island and several rocksoff it ; both the islands may be passed M^thin half a mile, but thereis no passage side them. To the northward of the northernmostisland, the coast runs to the eastward, forming a large and deep bay,which at a distance looks very inviting; but before we were withina mile of the depth of it, we were in three fathoms, with rocks allround us, some above and others a little below water. From thebay being well sheltered from the southward, they do not show tillclose to, except two patches which are off the north point, and arealways uncovered. A mile to the northward of these rocks there is'another bay, which is quite clear of danger ; and in the south cornerof it, a small cove, there is good anchorage in seven fathoms,well sheltered from southerly winds, but very open to northerly.The water is perfectly smooth vidth a southerly wind, and no swellcould ever reach it aimless it blew from the northward. There is asmall bay, half a mile to the northward of this, where a vessel mayanchor, but it is not so well sheltered ; there were no signs of inhabitants,nor the least appearances of water in the valleys. The landat the back of the bay is low, but to the northward of the northbay it rises to a ridge of sand hills, mining east and west, and terminatingin a steep rocky point, with a cluster of steep rocky isletsoff it. To the northward of this point the coast is rocky andbroken, With rocks a short distance from the shore for about fourmiles, where there is a rugged point with a very high, sharp-toppedhill a little in-shore, which from the southward shews a doublepeak ; directly to the northward of this point, there is a deep rockyAPPENDIX. 219bay, with a small cove close to the point where we anchored infive fathoms, but half a cable off shore on either side : it is notfit for a vessel. The bay is partly sheltered from northerly winds,but a northerly swell rolls in, and it does not appear to be a properplace for a vessel to enter.From an old fisherman, who was living in a hut, we learned thatthe name of the place is Barranquilla de Copiapopo, and to oursurprise saw a cargo of copper prepared for shipping. He also toldus that another cargo had been shipped from the same place abouta year before ; though the cove is too small for any vessel to anchorin with safety, and outside it the water deepens very suddenly.Tliere is no anchorage in the cove at the head of the bay, and thelanding there is very bad ; in the small cove the landing is good.There is no fresh water nearer than the river of Copiapopo, which isabout fifteen miles off.The deep bight to the southward of this, in which are the threebays before mentioned, is called Salado Bay ; the south point of it,with the island off it, is Point Buenos. No vessel had ever been ineither of these bays, but the middle one is much superior to Bar-tranquilly,and might be a much better place to embark the ores.From BarranquiUa to Point Dallas the coast is rocky and broken,without any place sufficient to shelter the smallest vessel. PointDallas is a black rocky point, with a hummock on its extreme,which, coming from the southward, appears to be an island ; the landrises to a range of low sandy hiUs, with rocky summits.The Caxa Grande is a small sharp-topped rock, which is the onlyone of the reef that shows above water ; the patch near the pointwas a-wash when we passed.The channel between it and Point Dallas appears to be wider thanit is given in former charts, but the reef off the point projectsmuch farther. The sea was high, and there was occasionally abreaker above a quarter of a mUe from the point ; at about thatdistance from the breakers cm the reef, the least water we had waseleven fathoms ; when the swell is not high, the breaker off thepoint would not show ; it appeared to be detached from the reefwhich joins the point.Copiapopo is a very bad port ; the swell roUs in heavily, and thelanding is worse than in any port to the southward ; it may easilybe known by the Morro, to the northward, which is a veryX 2'220APPENDIX.remarkable hill, nearly level at the top, but near the east extremeof it there are two small hummocks ; the east fall is very steep,the end of another range of hills shews to the northward. Tothe S.W., apparently forming part of the same range, is anotherhill, the west side of which forms a steep bluff ; in coming fromthe southward, these hUls will be seen in clear weather, beforethe land about the port can be made out. From a fisherman, whoknew the coast to the southward, we learned that the small port wepassed the night in, to the northward of Port Herradura, is calledMatamores ; the high point to the southward of it is Point Mata-mores.Tortoral, or Tortoral saxo, is the bay between it and Pajonal.He described it as having always a heavy surf in it, and the landingbad. The south point of the Bay of Salado, vdth the islet off it,is called Point losCachos. He was in the vessel that took the cargoof copper from Barranquilla. She was a large brig of 300 tons,and was anchored off the mouth of the cove. The island to thenorth of Copiapopo Bay, called Isla Grande, is very remarkable ; ithas a small nipple on each extreme, that on the eastern is thehighest : to the westward of the middle of the island, there is anothersmall round nipple.The channel between Isla Grande and the main is clear of dangerin the middle ; but such a heavy swell rolls through, that it isscarcely fit for any vessel. Off the north extreme of the islandthere is a reef under water, projecting two cables to the eastward ;at a cable's length distance from the reef we had eight fathoms ; thepoint on the main appeared to have no danger off it ; the rocks tothe southward of it are inside the line of the points. The swell inthe channel was by far the worst we had experienced on this coast :to the northward of the island there are several small rocks, one ofwhich is high. There is no danger within a quarter of a mile ofthem.The point on the main, to the northward of the island, is veryrocky ; on the S.W. point there are two rugged hummocks, andseveral rocks and islets close to the shore, but no danger outsidethem : from this to Point Morro, the shore is steep and cliffy, withremarkable patches of white rock in the cUffs to the south of thepoint, which is steep, with rugged lumps on its summit. TheMorro rises suddenly, a Uttle in-shore.On rounding the point, you open a deep bay which runs in to theAPPENDIX. 221S.E.; there are several small rocky patches in it, and at the north endof the long sandy beach there is a piece of rocky coast, the north extremepoint of which has a small island off it. The entrance to PortYngles is to the southward of this point, round a low rocky point, to thesouthward of which, close in-shore, there is a small island off a sandycove ; there is a rock a- wash at high-water, about a cable's length tothe N.W. of the south extreme point, but it always shows ; afterpassing this rock the point is steep-to, and may be approached withina cable's length. The harbour inside forms several coves, in the first ofwhich, on the starboard hand going in, there is anchorage for smallvessels, but the bottom is stony and bad. There is a low island tothe S.E. of this cove, above which is the best anchorage, withsoutherly winds. About half-way between it and a projecting rockypoint on the east shore, small vessels may go much closer into thecove, to the southward of the island, where the landing is very good.The bay in the Nee. corner is well sheltered from northerly winds,and no sea could ever get up in it ; but the landing is not so goodthere, the best is at a rocky point at the south end of the northernmostbeach, where there is a small cove among the rocks perfectlysmooth : it is by far the best harbour, but there is no fresh waternear. The cove at the head of the harbour is very shoal; novessel should go higher up than abreast of the projecting rockypoint on the east shore, where she would have four and fivefathoms in mid-channel. The bottom is hard sand, and may be seenin twelve fathoms water, which makes it appear very shallow. Inthe entrance there are eighteen fathoms close to the shore on bothsides.Poet Caldera is close to the northward of Port Yngles, and isdirectly round the point with the small island ofF it ; it is a fine bay,well sheltered, but the entrance more open than Port Yngles, andthe landing not so good. There was a cargo of copper ore ready tobe shipped in the south comer of the bay ; but no vessel had thenever taken a cargo away. There were a few fishermen Having in a holein the cliflT during the fishing season : the only vessel they had everseen in the port was a brigantine, with provisions for the mines.No vessel had ever been in Port Yngles. There is water nearthe beach, on the east side, but it is very salt ; it appears wonderfulhow they can make use of it. but they have no other nearer thanCopiapopo. The land is entirely covered with loose sand, except a few222 APPENDIX.rocks on the points ; the bottom of the bay is low, but the bulls risea Uttle inland,. and the ranges become higher as they recede from thecoast : the first hill to the eastward is a very remarkable sharp-toppedhiU, the sides of whiUch are covered with sand, with two low paps tothe eastward of it. They have had strong northers here for twodays, and sometimes a good deal of sea in the south corner of thebay ; but in the north-east corner, which they call CalderiUo, it isthen smooth; they very seldom have heavy northers. There are'fish to be got in the bay, but only with a net : in all the ports wevisited we caught none alongside. Near the outer points of the portsthere are rock fish to be caught, but there is always a heavy swellin such places.Point Cabeza de Vaca is a remarkable point, about twelve milesto the northward of Caldera : it has two small hummocks near itsextreme ; inside them the land is nearly level for some distance inshore,where it rises to several low hills, which form the extremity ofa range. The coast between Caldera and the point forms severalsmall bays, with rocky points between them, off all of which thereare rocks a short distance : there is no danger within a quarter ofa mile from Point Cabeza de.Vaca. To the northward of the pointthere is a small rocky bay, called Tortoralillo, oiF the north entrancepoint of which there is a reef of rocks, with a high rock at the extremeof it, which extends above a quarter of a mile from the shore : abouthalf a mile to the north-west of this there is a heavy breaker whenthere is much swell.To the northward of this the coast is steep and rocky for three orfour miles, with a high range of bills running close to the shore ; thenthere is a small cove, called Obispito, with a white rock on the southpoint of it : to the northward of this the land is low and very rocky,with breakers about a quarter of a mile from the shore. About twomiles from the cove there is a point, with a small white islet off it ; tothe northward of which the coast trends to the eastward, and formsthe small cove of Obispo, in which we anchored, but it is not fit for anyvessel. There was a fire on shore in the night, but we saw no ore, andhas the landing was bad we did not attempt it. There is a very high sandhill,with the summit stony, a little in-shore of the cove, and to thenorthward of it a higher range of stony hiUs running close to theFor more intonation respecting the vicinity of Copiapopo, see pages22D and 230.APPENDIX. 223coast for about seven miles, where it terminates in low rugged hillsa little in-shore of a brown rugged point, with a large white patchon its extreme, which is an islet, but does not show as one from thesea. To the northward of this point there is a fine bay, in whichwe anchored, and, from a fisherman who came otF, learned that it isFlamenco : it is a very good port, well sheltered from southerlywinds, and better from northerly, as the point projects far enoughto prevent a heavy sea getting up. The lauding is good in the S.E.corner of the bay, either on the rocks, or on a beach in a small covein the middle of a patch of rocks, a little more to the northward,where there are a few huts, in which two brothers, with their families,were living ; their chief employment was catching and saltingfish, called cougre, and drying them to supply Copiapopo. In oneday they had caught foi: hundred. They appeared to live in amiserable way, in huts made of seal and guanaco skins, much worsethan a Patagoniann "toldo"; the only water they had to drink washalf salt, and some distance from the shore. They sometimes getguanacoes, that they run down with dogs, of which they have agreat number. ^The only vessel they had ever seen here, was a ship whichanchored one night, on her way to Las Animas for copper ore, sixyears ago ; they described Las Animas as a very bad place, not fit forany vessel, and in consequence no cargo had ever been shipped again,but taken to Chaneral, which was better, but not so good as Flamenco.There are no mines so near Flamenco as to Chaneral.Flamenco may be known by the white patch on the brownrugged point, to the southward of which, in-shore, there are lowjugged bills, rising to a high range. On the north side of the baythe land is very low: the north point is a low rocky point, with adetached hUl rising out of the low land a little in-shore. To thenorthward there is another lull very much Uke it ; in the depth ofthe bay the land is very low, and a deep valley runs back betweentwo ranges of rugged hills. The hiUs are all covered with yellowsand near their bases, and to about half way up their sides, the topssaxe stony, with a few stunted bushes.In the bay, to the northward of Flamenco, in which Las Animaswas said to be, we could see no place fit even for a boat to land; thewhole bay is rocky, with a few little patches of sand, and a heavysurf was breaking on the shore. The north point of this bay is224 APPENDIX.low, but a little In-shore there is a high range of hills, the outsideof which is very steep : to the northward of this point there is asmall rocky bay, which appears to answer better to the descriptionof Las Animas than the other ; it did not appear a fit place for vessels,and the landing was bad. The north point of this bay is asteep rocky point, with a round brown hill rising directly from thewater's edge ; the sides of the hiUs are crossed by dark veins, runningin different directions, which are very remarkable. To thenorthward of this point there is a deep bay, which, from the description,must be Chaneral : the south side of it is rocky with smallcoves, but the landing appeared to be bad ; the east and northshores of it were low and sandy, and a heavy surf was breaking onthe beach. We could see no signs of any people, or piles of ore,along the coast ; and as it did not appear a good place for vessels,and our time was short, it was not thought worth a more particularexamination. The north point of the bay is low and rocky, with ahigh range a little in-shore. To the northward of this point thehills and coast are both composed of brown and red rocks, with afew bushes on the summits of some cf the hills : the sandy appearancethe hills have to the southward ceases, and the prospect is, ifpossible, more barren.Nearly nine miles to the northward of the point of this bay isSugar Loaf Island, which is about half a mile from the shore ; incomingfrom the southward, there is a high sugar loaf hill on themain, a little to the southward of the island, for which it may bemistaken, but the island is not so high and the summit is sharper.Between Sugar Loaf Island and Chaneral, the coast is rocky andaffords no shelter : there is a small bay to the southward of thepassage, between the island and the main, which would afford shelterfrom northerly winds, but with southerly it is exposed, and thelanding is very bad. In the middle of the passage there are fivefathoms in the shallowest part : the water in the northern end of itis smooth, and a vessel might anchor off the point of the island,sheltered from southerly winds, in six or seven fathoms ; but aftereight fathoms it deepens suddenly to thirteen and twenty fathoms,about half a mile from the island. There is a small bay on themain, to the northward of the channel, where a vessel would besheltered from southerly winds, but we did not examine it.About twenty miles to the northward of the Sugar Loaf IslandAPPENDIX. 225there is a projecting point, with some small rocky islets off it, whichwe supposed to be Point Galena, from the description given at PortCaldera. Between the point and the Sugar Loaf Island, the coastruns hack a Uttle, and is rocky, with a high range of hills runningclose to the shore. A Httle to the northward of Point Fallen thereis a small bay, with a rocky islet about half a mile off the southpoint of it ; the top of the islet is white, and answers the descriptiongiven to us of a port called Ballenita : but it is not worththe name of a port; it is very rocky, with two or three small patchesof sandy beaches, in which a heavy surf was breaking ; the hillsrun close to the water, and have a very rugged appearance. Alittle to the northward of this there is another bay, which seemed tobe Lavata : the south point has several low rugged points upon it,and in-shore the hills rise very steep. There is a small cove withexcellent landing, directly behind this point, on which we anchored ;there was a better-looking port inside, but it was so far from theouter coast, that our time would not allow more than a hasty glance.The inner cove of the bay in which we anchored appeared toafford good shelter from southerly winds, and the water was verysmooth. A little to the northward of this bay there is a point,which, till close, appears to be an island: but it is joined to theshore by a low shingle spit : the summit of it is rugged, with severalsteep peaks on it : several rocky islets lie scattered off the point.Near three miles and a half to the northward of this, there is anotherpoint, very rugged, and with a high round hummock a littlein-shore : to the southward of this point there is a deep bay, in whichwe expected to find Paposo, as we were some distance to the northwardof its position in the old charts, but there were no appearancesof any houses or inhabitants : the bay is very rocky, and does notafford good anchorage ; several rocks lie off the south point, and alittle inside it there is a reef running half-a-mile from the shore: inthe bottom of the bay there are several small white islets ; and twoor three small sandy coves, which are not large enough to affordshelter for a vessel. This bay is called Isla Blancaa.About three miles from the north point of the bay, there is awhite islet, with some rugged hummocks upon it : a little in-shorethere is a hill of a much lighter colour than any round it ; to the northwardof this there is a deep bay, in which we were certain of findingPaposo, and, as wc were becalmed, I went in a boat to search for it ;226 APPENDIX,on landing at the point we saw a smoke on the east side of the bay,and, on pulling over there, found two fishermen, who told us thatthe place was Hues Parado, and that Paposo was round anotherpoint about eight miles to the northward. On inquiring for water,they brought us some, which was better than what was used in someother places to the southward, but it was still scarcely fit for use ;they said it was similar at Paposo, and they thought it very good.In the south comer of the bay there appeared to be fit anchorage forvessels, and the landing good, but very open to northerly winds.No vessel had ever been there in the recollection of the men that wespoke to, neither had they heard of any ; they described Paposo ashaving only four ' ranchos ' and a few fishermen : the port not good.The bay that Paposo is in they called Nostra Senora, the northpoint of the bay Point Rincon, and the south. Point Grande ; theprojecting point, answering to the Point Nostra Senora of theSpanish charts, they called Point Plata. The bay to the northwardof Point Fallen, is BaUenita ; the bay in which we anchoredto the northward of it is called Lavata ; the point, with the peninsula,is Isla de las Ortolans : the point to the northward of it PointSan Pedro ; the bay which we were in afterwards is Isla Blancaa,and the point of Hues Parado Bay, Point Taltal.The only place at which we observed the time of syzygial high-water,quite satisfactorily, was Huasco,* where it is 8.30, and the rise fourfeet at neap tides ; at springs, it rises about two feet more. Fromthe swell on all this coast, it is very difficult to get the time of high-waterat aU near the truth ; the rise and fall appeared to be fiveor six feet on aU parts of the coast. The only perceptible currentwe experienced was in the channel between Sugar Loaf Island and-the main, where there was a very slight one to the northward, notmore than a quarter of a mile an hour; and this was after a freshbreeze from the southward for several days. It is said, however, byboasters, that there is usually a set, towards the north, of abouthalf a mUe an hour.• And here the tide was very carefully observed in a cove, wherethere was no swell ; yet from the small rise, the exact time could not betakenwithin a few minutes. The water remained at the same levelabout half an hour.IAPPENDIX-227Winds on the Coast of Chile.Very few words will suffice to give strangers to the coast ofChile a clear idea of the winds and weather they may expect tofind there, for it is one of the least uncertain climates on the faceof the globe.From the parallel of 35° S., or thereabouts, to near 25° S., thewind is southerly, or south-easterly, during nine months out oftwelve ; in part of the other three there are calms, or lightvariable breezes, and the remainder is really bad weather ; northerlygales and heavy rain prevailing, not only on the coast, but faracross the ocean in parallel latitudes.From September to May is the fine season, during which the skiesof Chile are generally clear, and, comparatively speaking, but littlerain falls. I do not, however, mean that there are not occasionalexceptions to the general case : strong northers have been known(though rarely) in summer ; and two or three days of heavy rain,with but Httle intermission, now and then disturb the equanimityof those who have made arrangements with implicit confidence inthe serenity of a summer sky. These im welcome interruptions arerarer, and of less consequence, northward of 31° than they are tothe south of that parallel : so nearly uniform, indeed, is the climateof Coquimbo, that the city is called ' La Serena.'In settled weather a fresh southerly wind springs up a little beforenoon (an hour sooner or later), and blows till about sunset, occasionallytill midnight. This wind is sometimes quite furious in theheight of summer ; so strong, indeed, that ships may be preventedfrom working into anchorages, especially Valparaiso Bay, althoughthey may take every previous precaution, by sending down topgallantyards, striking top-gallant masts, and close-reefing theirsails. But the usual strength of the southerly sea-breeze (as it iscalled, though it blows along the land from the south) is such as agood ship would carry double-reefed top-sails to, while working towindward.This is also nearly the average strength of a southerly wind inthe open sea, between the parallels above-mentioned, and there it isneither so strong by day, nor does it die away at night. Withinsight of the land a ship finds the wind freshen and diminish,228 APPENDIX.nearly as much as in the ports of this coast, where the nights aregenerally calm, till a land breeze from the eastward springs up.This light message from the Cordillera is never troublesome, neitherdoes it last many hours. "With these winds the sky is almost alwaysclear ; indeed, when the sky becomes cloudy it is a sure sign of littleor no sea breeze in summer, and probably a fall of rain : in thewinter it foretels an approaching northerly wind, with rain.In summer, ships anchor close to the land, to avoid being drivenout to sea by strong southerly winds ; but as the winter approachesa more roomy berth is advisable, though not too far out, becausenear the shore there is always an undertow, and the wind is lesspowerful. Seamen should bear in mind that the course of thewinds on this coast, as in all the southern hemisphere, is fromnorth to south, by the west : that the hardest northerly blow, withmost sea, comes from the westward of north, and that, therefore,they should get as much as possible under the shelter of rocks orland to the westward of them, rather than of those which onlydefend from north winds, ' Northern,' as they are called, give goodwarning : an overcast sky ; little or no wind unless easterly ; a swellfrom the northward; water higher than usual; distant land remarkablyvisible, besides being raised by refraction ; and a falling barometer; are their sure indications : but all northers are not gales :some years pass without one that can be so termed ; though few yearspass in succession without ships being driven ashore on Valparaisobeach. Thunder and lightning are rare : wind of any disagreeablestrength from the east is unknown. West winds are only felt whilea ' norther ' is shifting round, previous to the sky clearing and thewind moderating. The violence of southerly winds lasts but a fewhours : that of a northerly gale seldom continues beyond a day anda night, generally, indeed, not so long.Some persons say that the strength of northerly winds is not feltto the northward of Coquimbo, but I have evidence of gales, withheavy seas, at Copiapopo : and Captain Eden informed me that he hada very heavy gale of wind in H. Mes. ' Conway,' in latitude 25° S.,and longitude 90° W., where such an interruption to the usualsoutherly winds was little expected.How to make passages is easy to tell, for there are but two ways.When going northward, steer direct to the place, or as nearly so asis consistent with making use of the steady winds which prevail inAPPENDIX. 229the offing : and if bound to the south, steer also du-sect to the place,if fortunate enough to have a wind which admits of your doing so ;but if not, stand out to sea, by the wind, keeping every sail clean full :the object being to get through the adverse southerly winds as soonas possible, and reach a latitude from which the ship will be sure ofreaching her port, on a direct course. Every experienced seamanknows that no method is more adverse to making quick passagesthan that of ' hugging the wind,' as it is called. When Sir ThomasHardy was on this coast, he used to cross the southerly winds witha topmast studding-sail set, as many men cross the trades, his objectbeing to get into other winds. The current on the coast of Chile isnortherly, about half a mile an hour ; varying a little with the wind.The idea some persons have of Copiapopo being a difficult place tomake is rather unfounded ; the following is the manner in which wemade it in the Beagle, when strangers to that part of the coast.July 3. A dull gloomy day, wind moderate from the southward ;at 10 A.M. we were thirty miles south of Copiapopo, by the dead reckoningfrom noon yesterday ; but being aware of the northerly set,which near the shore is half a mile an hour, we steered an E.N.E.course in for the land ; at noon it was in sight, forming two longrounded-topped hills : the northern one was the highest, it ended inabluff, with a low point sloping off it ; this we rightly supposedwas the Morro of Copiapopo, it bore Nee. ; and the other which wasa-head the high land of Tortoral ; this had a gradual slope to seaward.A roimd and rather peaked black rock, about ten feet high, alittle open, of a low level (eighty-five feet high) of a light browncolour, with some remarkable white patches on it, was seen at three ;and a little before it, about a point south of the Morro, was a low,black, rocky island. The latter was Isla Grande, and the former theCaxa Grande rock, with the west point of the anchorage cove, onwhich there is a flag staff : as we neared the land the wind graduallyleft us ; and, as the day closed, we were four miles from the CaxaGrande. The clouds that covered the high land in-shore of Copiapopo,lifted off a little in the evening, showing us two remarkable hills, onewith a notched top, and the other like a sugar loaf, with rather a flattop ; this was in a direction a little south of the Caxa Grande, and230 APPENDIX,the other nearly over Isla Grande. (Head to the westward duringthe night with light variable airs.)July 4. A perfect calm aU day, and no observation : we weredrifted abreast of the bluff under the Morro by the afternoon ; it hassome very curious white patches, which are seen at some distance ;indeed the whole of the land is very remarkable. Plyed to the southwardduring the night, wind light.July 5. Wind light from the N.N.E., and gloomy weather; at 10A.M., passed one mile to the Nee. of the reef; north of the CaxaGrande rock we had eighteen fathoms, between it and the IslaGrande-with, fifty-seven outside, and sixteen in. As we stood in wecould not, from the mast-head, see any thing of the breakers said tobe off the Caxa Grande rock : as the breakers ran high on the otherreefs ; had there been any thing of the sort there, we should mostlikely have seen it : all the information we have been able to get on the.subject denies their existence. Detached, but close to the Nee. partof the anchorage point, are two black rocks, ten feet high ; theyshow well from the northward. About twenty-five miles to the Nee.of the Morro, are two singular peaks : they are higher than any ofthe other land ; the summit of the northern one is very pointed, andthe southern is rather saddle-topped ; these, it would seem, muet bevery remarkable from seaward. We anchored in seven fathoms, CaxaGrande rock bearing S. 67° W., distant three cables from the tworocks before-mentioned.As Iquique is situated on a part of the coast where calms are frequent,and exposed to a constant swell from the westward, there mayperhaps exist some difficulty in finding it ; indeed, from this very circumstance,persons do not go sufficiently near the shore, althoughthe position of the spot is nearly correct in the common charts.The centre of the island Hes in lat. 20° 12' 30" S. and long.70° 15' W. The sight indentation the bay makes in this high precipitouscoast is not perceptible from an offing of nine or ten miles, neitheris the collection of sand behind and south of the bay likely to catchthe eye of a stranger : should there happen to be a vessel there, herdark masts against the white sand make an excellent mark ; withoutwhich, there is nothing to guide a stranger until he gets within sightof the church steeple, or some white patches in the cliffs under Ta-appendix.girapaca Mountain ; the latter will probably be seen first ; they are ninemUes to the southward of the anchorage.The houses in the village, when first seen, have just the appearanceof so many black rocks on a sandy beach. The anchorage is verytolerable, as it is sheltered from the S.W. swell by the island; whichis surrounded by numerous small detached rocks, particularly on theNee. and W. sides; therefore it should not be approached nearerthan half a mUe.This island was once much higher ; the many cargoes of birds'dung* it has afforded have reduced it to its present low state. Thelanding is bad at the best time, as you have to thread your wayamong patches of sunken rocks ; on which the sea breaks with greatviolence at the fvdl and change of the moon : several boats have beenknocked to pieces, and lives lost. In the summer it is a calm nearlyall night, sometimes there is a light air from the land. The sea breezesets in from the southward or south-west about ten or eleven inthe forenoon ; it seldom blows fresh, but lasts imtil eight or ten atnight. In the winter, calms, hazy weather, and light northerly windsare common.The only trade now to Iquique is for saltpetre ; the rich silvermines formerly worked are exhausted.The water the inhabitants use is brought from Pisagua, a small baythirty miles to the northward, for which they pay dearly, brackishas it is. Forty houses and an old chin-ch, situated on a bare sandyflat, without a vestige of verdure of any kind near, are the featuresIquique presents ; in vain does the eye wander for something greento rest upon — extreme desolation reigns every where, from shoreto summit.No. 41.Remarks on the Coast of Peru.All the bearings are magnetic.From Point San Pedro (the south point of the bay of NostraSenior), at the distance of twenty miles, is Point Grande, thenorth point of the before-named bay. This point, when seen fromthe S.W., appears high and rounded, terminating in a low ruggedCalled ' guano :' it is a valuable manure.235i APPENDIX.spit, with several hummocks on it, and surrounded by rocks andbreakers to the distance of a quarter of a mile. N. 21° W., ninemiles and a quarter, is Point Rincon, having a large white rock oiFit; between these two points, in the latitude of 25.02 S., lies thevillage of Paposo, the most northern village on the coast of ChUe.This is a miserable place, containing about 200 inhabitants, underan Alcalde ; the huts are scattered, and difficult to distinguish, fromtheir being the same colour as the hills at the back of them. Vesselstouch here occasionally for dried fish and copper ore : theformer plentiful but the latter scarce. The mines he in a S.E. direction,seven or eight leagues distant : but are very little worked.Wood and water may be obtained on reasonable terms; the water isbrought from wells two miles off, and is difficult to embark. Vesselsbound for this place should run in on a parallel of 25.05., andwhen at the distance of two or three leagues, the white islet offPoint Rincon will appear, and shortly after the low white head ofPaposo. The course should be immediately shaped for the latter ; forwith that head hearings. S.E. , distant half a mile, is the anchorage, infrom fourteen to twenty fathoms, sand and broken shells. Should theweather be clear (whiUch is seldom the case), a rornid hiU, hiUgher thanthe surrounding ones, and immediately over the village, is also agood guide.North twenty-three degrees west from Point Grande, at the distanceof twenty-three miles, is Point Plata, similar in every respectto Point Grande, terminating in a low spit, off which he severalsmall rocks, forming a bay on the northern side, with from seventeento seven fathoms water ; rocky, uneven ground.From this point to Point Jara, which hes north ten degrees west,fifty-two miles, the coast runs in nearly a direct line, a steep, rockyshore, surmounted with hills, from 2,000 to 2,500 feet high, andwithout any visible shelter, even for a boat.Point Jara is a steep, rocky point, with a rounded summit, andhas on its northern side a snug cove for small craft; it is visitedoccasionally by sealing vessels, who leave their boats to seal in thevicinity. Water is left with them ; and for fuel they use the kelp,which grows in great quantity, as neither of these necessaries of lifeare to be had within twenty-five leagues on either side often.Nearly four miles due north from this point is the south point ofthe large bay of Moreno, or Playa brava, high and rocky, with aAPPENDIX. 233black rock lying oiFit ; and. 26° W., twcntjr-two miles distant, isPoint Davis (the south-west point of Moreno peninsula), whichslopes gradually from Mount Moreno, and has two nipples on itsextreme.Mount Moreno, formerly called George Hill, is the most conspicuousobject on this part of the coast ; its summit is 4,060 feet abovethe level of the sea, sloping gradually on the south side to PointDavis, where it terminates ; and on the north more abruptly towardsthe barren plain on which it stands. It is of a light brown colour,without the slightest sign of vegetation, and has a deep ravine on itswestern side.Immediately under Mount Moreno is Constitucion Harbour, asmall but snug anchorage, formed by the main land on one side andForth Island on the other. Here a vessel might careen and undergorepairs without being exposed to the heavy rolling swell which setsinto most of the ports on this coast ; and the landing is excellent :the best anchorage is oif a sandy spit at the north-east end of theisland, in six fathoms water, muddy bottom ; farther out the holdingground is bad ; it would be advisable to moor ship securely, asthe sea-breeze sometimes sets in strong. In running in, the island,or weather side, should not be hugged too close, as a number ofsunken rocks lie oft" the low cliffy points — some only being buoyedby kelp. A mid-channel course would be the best, provided the windallowed of reaching the anchorage before-mentioned : neither woodnor water are to be found in this neighbourhood — therefore provisionmust be made accordingly.N. 8° W., twelve miles from this harbour, is Moreno Head, asteep bluff, the termination of a range of table land, which runsin a line from Mount Moreno ; on the northern side of this headis Herradura Cove, a narrow inlet, running in to the eastward, withoutaffording any shelter.N. 4° W., nine miles from this head, lies Low Point, with somesunken rocks lying off it, and five miles farther on is LeadingBluff ; this is a very remarkable headland, and with the hill ofMexillones, which lies a few miles south of it, is an excellentguide for the port of Cobija ; it is about one thousand feet high,and facing the north is entirely covered wth guano, which givesit the appearance of a chalky cliff. There is an islet about halfa mile to the north-west, attached to the main by a reef ofy234 APPENDIX.rocks, but no danger of any description outside it. The hill ofMexillones is 2,650 feet high, has the appearance of a cone withthe top cut oflF, and stands conspicuously above the surroundingheights. This in clear weather is undoubtedly the best ofthe two marks ; but as the tops of hills on the coast of Peru arefrequently covered with heavy clouds, the bluff is the surer mark, forit cannot be mistaken ; as, besides its chalky appearance, it is thenorthern extreme of the peninsula, and the land falls back severalmiles to the eastward of it.Round this head is the spacious bay of Mexillones, eight milesacross — but of little use, as neither wood or water is to be obtained-theshore is steep-to ; there is anchorage on the west side, twomiles inside the blufF, a cable's length off a sandy spit, in sevenfathoms sandy bottom : at the distance of three cables there is thirtyfathoms.From this bay the coast runs nearly north and south, without anythingworthy of remark, until you reach the Bay of Cobija, or LaMar. This lies N. 13° E. thirty-one mUes from Leading BlufF, isthe only port of the Bolivian Republic, and contains about fourteenhundred inhabitants. Vessels call occasionally to take in copper oreand cotton ; but the trade is small (particularly in 1835, as therevolution in Peru had destroyed the little they had). Water is scarce,at least, that which is good : there are wells, but the water fromthem is very brackish, and will not keep in casks. Fresh meatmay be procured at a high price ; but fruit and vegetables, even fortheir owt consumption, are brought from Valparaiso, a distance ofseven hundred miles. They have a mud-built fort, of five or sixguns, on the summit of the Point ; the only fortification about theplace.If coming from the southward toward this bay : after having passedthe Leading BlufF (which should always be made), it would be advisableto shape a course so as to close the land two or three leaguesto windward of the port, and then coast along until two white-toppedislets, ofF False Cobija Point, are seen ; a mile and a quarter to thenorthward of them is the port. On the Cobija Point there is a whitestone, which shews very plainly, in relief against the black rocks atthe back of it : a white flag is usually hoisted at the fort, when a vesselappears in the offing — which is also a good guide. In going inthere is no danger ; the point is steep-to, and may be rounded at aAPPENDIX. 035cable's length distant, and the anchorage is good in eight or ninefathoms, sand and broken shells. In the bay there are a number ofstraggling rocks, all well pointed out by kelp. It is high waterat the full and change at 9 h. 54m., and the tide rises four feet.Landing, at all times is indifferent, and at full and change, owing tothe heavy swell, it requires some skill in winding through the narrowchannel, formed by rocks on each side. Two miles north and eastis Copper Cove, a convenient place for taking in the ore ; there isanchorage in twelve fathoms, a short distance from the shore.After leaving the north point of Cobija Bay, which has a numberof straggling rocks a short distance oiF it, the coast takes a rathermore easterly direction ; generally shallow sand bays, yviih rockypoints, and hills from two to three thousand feet high close to thecoast, but no anchorage or place fit for shipping, until you reachAlgodon Bay, twenty-eight miles from Cobija.This bay is small, and the water deep ; we anchored a quarter of amile from the shore, in eleven fathoms, sand and broken shells, overa rocky bottom ; its only use is as a stopping-place for water, shouldit be required. It may be obtained at the Gully of Mamilla (sevenmiles to the northward) from a spring, a mile and a half from thebeach ; the usual method of bringing it is in bladders made of sealskin,holding seven or eight gallons each, with which most of thecoasters are provided — the only vessels that profit by a knowledge ofthese places.Algodon Bay may be distinguished by a guy leading down to it,and that of Mamilla to the northward, which has two paps on theheights, over the north side of it ; there is also a white islet off Algo-don Point.N. 2° W., ten miles from this bay, is a projecting point, calledin the Spanish chart San Francisco, but known more generallyby the name of Paquiqui ; on the north side of it, and near theextreme, is a large bed of guano, so much used on this coast formanure, that it may be said to be quite a trade. A brig of onehundred and seventy tons was loading with it for Islay at the timewe passed ; she was moored head and stern within a cable's lengthof the rocks, on which a considerable surf was breaking, and theguano was brought off in a balsa to a launch just outside the surf.There is better anchorage farther in the bay ; but this is chosen forconvenience.y2236 APPENDIX.N. 2°W., sixteen miles from Paquiqui, is Point Arena, a low,sandy point, with rocky outline : between the two is a small fishingvillage, near a remarkable hummock : anchorage may be obtainedunder Point Arena, in ten fathoms ; fine sandy bottom.N. 6° E., twelve miles from Point Arena, is the gully and riverof LoA, which forms the boundary hne between Bolivia and Peru.It is the principal river on this part of the coast ; but its watersare extremely bad, in consequence of running over a bed of saltpetre,and the hiUs surrounding it containing a quantity of copperore. It is send that the ashes of a volcano faU into it, whichadd greatly to its unwholesomeness ; but bad as it is, the peopleresiding on its banks have no other. At Chacansi, in the interior,where it dilates, it is tolerably good. In the summer seasonit is about fifteen feet broad and a foot deep, and runs withconsiderable strength to within a quarter of a mile of the sea, where.it spreads, and flows over, or filters through the beach ; but does notmake even a hatchway, or throw up any banks, ever so small.A chapel on the north bank, half a mile from the sea, is the onlyremains of a once populous village. People from the interior visit itoccasionally for guano, which is in abundance.There is good anchorage, but rather exposed to the sea-breeze,with the chapel bearing north, half a mile from the shore, in from,eight to twelve fathoms, muddy bottom ; and landing may be effectedunder Point Chile ; but the best anchorage near here is the Bay ofChipana, six miles N. 39° W. from the river, and a snug cove forlanding, near the extreme of the point ; but at the full and changeaheavy swell sets in, and I doubt a boat being able to land with.goods at those times.The best distinguishing mark for the Loa is the gully throughwhich it runs, that may be easily known from its being in thedeepest part of the bay, formed by Point Arena on the south andPoint Lobo on the north ■; and the liiUs on the south side being nearlyleve while those on the north are much higher and irregular.For the Bay of Chipana — after making the land in the latitudeof the Loa, a large white double patch is seen on the side of a hillnear the beach, and another similar one, a little to the northward : ondiscovering these marks (which may be seen three or four leagues),a course should be shaped directly for the southern end, where liesthe anchorage in seven fathoms, sand and broken shells, under a low.APPENDIX. 237level point. No danger need be feared in entering ; as although theland is low, it may be approached within half a mile, in from six toten fathoms. The anchorage inside the long kelp-covered reef mio-htperhaps, be preferred ; but the landing is not so good.N. 27° W. of this bay, at the distance of eighteen miles, is PointLoBo, or Blancaa, high and bold, on its extreme are several hillocks.Between these two is a small fishing village, called Chomache, undera point, which has a long reef off it, on the outer part of whicha cluster of rocks shew themselves a few feet above water. Thepeople of this village get their water from the Loa — a passagerequiring, on a balsa, four days or more.N. 21° W., fourteen miles off Point Lobo, is Point Palace, a lowrugged projecting point, with an islet a quarter of a mile off it, butquite clear outside this islet : half way between these two points isthe Cone (PabeUon) of Pica, a remarkable hillock of guano appearingas if it had been covered with snow which had thawed atthe top, leaving the lower half frozen, contrasting strongly vnth thesurrounding hills, which are of a barren sun-burnt brown. This isalso a place of resort for the guano vessels ; they find pretty good anchorageclose to the northward of the Pabellon.East, a little southerly, a few noes in-shore of this, is a beU-shapedmountain, named Carrasco, 5,500 feet high : in clear weatherit is a good mark for the neighbourhood of Iquique.From Point Palace to Point Grande, N. sew. twenty-eight miles,the coast is low and rocky, the termination of a long range of tableland,Ceded the heights of Oyarvide, or Barracks, from its cliffyappearance : it has innumerable rocks and shoals off it, and should •not be approached on any account nearer than a league, for the frequentcalms and heavy swell peculiar to this coast render it unsafefor nearer approach.Point Grande at the north end of the Barracks, is a low cliffypoint, with three white patches on its northern side ; round thispoint is the Bay of Cheuranatta.N. 3°W., eleven miles from Point Grande is the anchorage andtown of Iquique ; a miserable place that affords scarcely sufficientprovisions for the consumption of its inhabitants, about five hundredsouls ; and no water nearer than Pisagua (a distance of nearly fortymiles), from which place it is brought by boats built for the purpose,and is very dear. Yet, with these disadvantages, it is a place of constAPPENDIX.miserable trade, from the quantity of saltpetre, and the silver mines ofHuantacayhua, in its neighbourhood : the latter are Uttle worked, asthe saltpetre is a surer profit, large cargoes of which are annuallytaken in English vessels. There are no imports ; all the propertybelongs to merchants in Lima, where vessels are chartered, and haveonly to call here and take in their cargoes.Vessels bound for this place should run in on the parallel of PointGrande, until the white patches on that point are discerned, when acourse should be shaped for the northern of three large sand hiUs :stand boldly in on this course til the church steeple appears, whenshortly after, the tovra and low island will be seen, under which isthe anchorage ; care must be taken in rounding this island to give itagood berth, a reef extending off it to the westward, to the distanceof two cables' lengths.The anchorage is good in eleven fathoms, with Point Piedrasbearing N. 9° W. ; W. extreme of the island, W. 32° S. ; churchsteeple S. 15° E.Vessels have attempted the passage between the island and themain by a mistake, and thereby got into danger, from which theyhave been extricated with difficulty : it is only lit for boats or verysmall vessels.Finding is bad and the way hazardous, owing to the number ofblind breakers with which it abounds ; boats have been lost at thefull and change of the moon, when the heavy swell sets in. Balsasare employed to bring cargoes to a launch at anchor outside thedanger, as is the case in most of the ports on this coast.N. 12° W., eighteen miles from Point Piedras (the north point ofIquique Bay, which has a cluster of rocks round it), is the small bayof MexiUones, appearing as a low black island vdth a white rocklying off it, and may be known by the Guy of Aurora a little tothe southward, and a road apparently well trodden on the side ofthe hUls, leading to the mines. And N. 20° W., thirty-three milesfrom Point Piedras, is Point Pichalo, a projecting ridge at rightangles to the general trend of the coast, with a number of hummockson it. Round to the northward of this point is the village and roadsteadof Guano Pisagua ; this, as well as MexiUones, is connectedwith Iquique in the saltpetre trade, and is resorted to by vessels forthat article. In rounding the point, a sunken rock lies about half acable's length off, and should be looked out for, as it is necessary toAPPENDIX. 239hug the land close to ensure fetching the anchorage off the village atthe beginning of the ridge ; baffling ^\^nds are frequent, which maythrow you near the shore, but do not signify, as the water is smoothand the shore steep-to. The best anchorage is with the extreme ofPisagua Point, N. 7° 30' W. ; and Pichalo Point, W. 1S° S., twocables' length off the village, in eight fathoms, by which you willavoid a rock with four feet water on it, lying off the sandy cove atthe distance of two cables.North of this, at the distance of two miles and a half, is the gullyand river of Pisagua, the water of which supplies the neighbouringinhabitants ; it is not, when at its greatest strength, more than tenfeet across, and then does not overflow, but merely filters through thebeach into the sea. Generally speaking, it is dry nine months in theyear ; webs are dug near it where water, such as it is, may always befound : but no vessel should trust to watering at this place, as, besidesits unwholesomeness, the difficulty and expense attending itwould be very great.From this to Point Gordo the coast is in low broken cliffs, with afew scattered rocks oiF it, and ranges of high hills near. Point Gordois a low jutting point, where a long line of cliff, several hundred feethigh, commences ; which continues, with only two breaks, to Arica.These breaks or gullies, as they are called, are very remarkable,and are useful in making Arica from the southward. The first is thegully of Camarones, which hes seven miles north of Point Gordo,and is about a mile in width, running at right angles to the coasttowards the mountains, with a stream of water running down it, anda quantity of brush-wood on its banks ; it forms a slight sandy bay,scarcely sufficient to shelter a vessel from the heavy swell.The Gully of Victor is the other ; it lies N. 17° W., twenty-ninemiles from that of Camarones, and fifteen miles from Arica ; it is aboutthree quarters of a mile in width, and from a high bold point, calledPoint Lobo, jutting out to the southward, forms a tolerably goodanchorage for small vessels ; it also runs toward the mountains in asimilar manner to that of Camarones, and Uke it has a small streamrunning through, with verdure on its banks. Vessels boimd to Aricashould endeavour to make this gully or ravine, and when withinthree or four leagues of it they will see Arica Head, which appearsas a steep bluffs, with a round hill in shore, called Monte Gordo.Upon nearer approach the island Guano will be observed, joined toAPPENDIX.the head by a reef of rocks. To the northward of this island, andround the head is the port and town of Arica, the sea-port of Tanna.Of late this place has been the seat of civil war from which it hasseverely suffered. It was in contemplation in the latter end of 1836to make it the port of the Folia-ian territory ; should that take place,it would perhaps become next in importance to the harbour of Callao,the principal port in Peru : its present exports are bark, cotton, andwool ; for which is received, in return, merchandize, chiefly British.Fresh provisions and vegetables, with all kinds of tropical fruit, maybehad in abundance and upon reasonable terms ; the water also isexcellent, and may be obtained Math little difficulty ; as a mole is runout into the sea, which enables boats to lie quietly while loading anddischarging : the only inconvenience is having to carry or roll itthrough the town. Fever and ague are said to be prevalent ; this inall probability arises from the bad situation which has been chosenfor the town, the high head to the southward excluding the benefitof the refreshing sea-breeze, which generally sets in about noon. Inentering this place there is no danger whatever ; the low island mayberounded at a cable's distance in seven or eight fathoms, and anchoragechosen where convenient.Hence the coast takes a sudden turn to the westward, and as far asthe river Juan de Dios, is a low sandy beach with regular soundings:from this river it gradually becomes more rocky, and increases inheight tiU it reaches the Point and Moro S.\ma, kno^^^l by some asthe Devil's Headland. This is the highest and most conspicuous landnear the sea, about this part of the coast, and appears from its boldnessto project beyond the neighbouring coast hne ; on its western sideis a cove formed by the point called Sama, where coasting vesselsoccasionally anchor for guano ; there are three or four miserablelooking huts, the residence of those who collect the guano ; it wouldbe quite impossible to land except in a balsa, and even then withdifficulty. Should a vessel be drifted down here by baffling windsand heavy swell, which has been the case, she should endeavour topass the head (as a number of rocks surround it) ; and about a mileto the westward anchorage may be obtained in fifteen fathoms.N. 4&° W., nine miles from Point Sama, is a low rocky point,called Tyke, tend between the two, the small river Lucumbu, havinglow cliffs on each side of it ; this, like most of the rivers on thecoast, kas not strength to make an outlet for itself, but is lost in theAl'PEXDIX. 941shingle beach at the foot of the before-mentioned cUffs ; regularsoundings, which continue gradually increasing until youreach PointColes, may be obtained at the distance of two mUes, in from fifteento twenty fathoms.W. 21° N., at the distance of thirty-one miles from Point Sama,is Point Coles ; the coast between is alternately sandy beach, withlow cliffs, and moderately high table land a short distance from thecoast. I doubt if landing could be effected any where between Aricaand Port Coles, as a high swell sets directly on this part and appearsto break with redoubled violence.Point Coles is very remarkable ; it is a low, sandy spit, rainingout from an abrupt termination of a line of table land. Near itsextreme is a cluster of small hummocks, the whole, at a distance,appearing as an island ; off the point, to the south-west, is a cluster ofrocks or islets, but no hidden dcuiger exists, although there is generallya quantity of froth, under which a reef may be suspected.N. 13° E., five miles and a half from this point, is the village androadstead of Ylo. This is a poor place, containing about three hundredinhabitants, under the local governor and captain of the port.But little trade is carried on, and that chiefly in guano : a mine ofcopper has been lately discovered, which may add to its importance.The inhabitants have to supply the necessaries of life by cultivation,and do not care to trouble themselves about luxuries. Wateris scarce, and wood is brought from the interior, so that it is noton any account a suitable place for shipping. The best anchorageis off the village of Pioche (a mile and a quarter south of thetown), in twelve or thirteen fathoms, and the best landing is inGuano Creek : but bad, indeed, is the best, and great care mustbe taken lest the boat be swamped, or hurled with violence againstthe rocks.In going into Ylo, the shore should not be approached nearer thanhalf a mile (as many sharp rocks and blind breakers exist), untilthree small rocks, called ' the Brothers,' always visible inside the tableend, bear east, when the village of Pioche may be steered for, andanchorage taken abreast of it, as convenient.English Creek affords the best landing, but boats are forbiddenthat cove, to prevent contraband trade being carried on.From Ylo, the coast trends to the westward, with a cliffy outline,from two to four hundred feet in height, and with one or two242 APPENDIX-coves,useful only to small coasters, until you reach the Valley ofTambo, which is of considerable extent, and may be easily distinguishedby its fertile appearance, contrasting strongly with the barrenand desolate cliffs on either side : those on the east maintain theirregu-laity for several miles, while on the west the regularity is broken,and from the near approach of the hills their aspect is bolder.The next point of this valley is called Mexico, it is E. 18° S.,twenty-one miles from Islay Point, and is exceedingly low, projectingconsiderably beyond the general trend of the coast ; it iscovered with brushwood to the water's edge, and at the distance oftwo miles in a southerly direction, soundings may be obtained inten fathoms, muddy bottom ; from that depth, in the same direction,it increases to twenty fathoms ; but on each side of the bank thereare fifty fathoms.W. 18° N., twenty-one miles from Point Mexico, is Point Islay,and between the two, five miles from the latter, the cove of Mol-lend,once the port of Arequipa ; but of late years the bottom hasbeen so much altered, that it is only capable of affording shelterto a boat or very small vessel ; in consequence of which it has beenthrown into disuse, and the bay of Islay now receives vessels thatbring goods to the Arequipa market.Islay, the port of Arequipa, formed by a few straggling islets offthe point, extending to the north-west, is capable of containingtwenty or five and twenty sail. The town is built on the west side of agradually declining hill, sloping toward the anchorage, and is said tocontain fifteen hundred inhabitants (chiefly employed by the merchantsof Arequipa). As in all the sea-ports of Peru, a local governor andcaptain of the port are the Authorities ; this is also the residence ofa British vice-consul. Trade was in a more flourishing conditionhere, even during a civil war, than at any place we visited ;there were generally four or five, and often double that number ofvessels discharging or taking in cargoes. 'J 'he principal exports werewool, bark, and specie, in exchange for which British merchandizewas chiefly coveted.Islay being much frequented by British merchant vessels, and differencesof opinion having arisen as to the best method of makingit, detailed and clear directions should be given. Vessels have frequentlybeen in sight, to the westward of the port, yet from thestrength of the current (half a knot, and at the full and change oftenAPPENDIX. 243as much as one knot per hour) setting to the westward, have beenprevented from anchoring for several days.This, no doubt, has been partly owing to the hitherto inaccurateposition assigned it, and from a proper reluctance to expose a vesselon an imperfectly known coast, to be baffled and drifted about bylight and variable airs, in addition to a heavy swell continually rollingdirectly toward the shore.With the following directions, it is to be hoped that more confidencewill be acquired, and consequently less delay occasioned insailing to the seaport of the second city of Peru.Coming from the southward, the land abreast of Tambo shouldbe made, and a certainty of that place ascertained, which (accordingto the state of the weather) may be seen from three to six leagues :the course should then be shaped toward a gap in the mountain tothe westward, with a defined sharp-topped hill in the near range, ashort distance from it. In this gap is the road leading to Arequipa,which winds along the foot of the before-named hill from Islay.As the coast is approached, the foot of the hills will be seen to becovered with white ashes (said to have been thrown from the volcanoof Arequipa), not found on any other part of the coast. Thispeculiarity commences a little westward of Tambo, and continuesas far as Point Homilies, and when within three leagues, the PointIslay and white islets forming the bay, will be plainly observed, andshould be steered for.Care must be taken in closing the point, as a rock, barely covered,lies a quarter of a mile to the southward. It is the custom to go tothe w .steward of all the islands ; but, with a commanding breeze, itwould unquestionably be better to run between the third outer andnext island,* which enables you to choose your berth at once ; thiscan seldom be done by the other route, the wind heading as youenter, obliging you to anchor, and use warps. The best anchorageis just within Flat Rock Point, off the landing-place, in ten or twelvefathoms. A hawser is necessary to keep the bow to the swell, toprevent rolling heavily, even in the most sheltered part. Vesselsfrom the eastward should close the land about Tambo, and observethe same directions.If from the eastward the parallel of seventeen degrees five minutes• His Majesty's ships Menai and Challenger passed in between theseislands.APPENDIX.should be made, and run in on, this will be about a league to thesouthward of the point ; and, if the longitude cannot be trusted.Point Cornelius, being the most remarkable land, and easily seenfrom that parallel, should be searched for in passing. It liesW. 28° N., fourteen miles from Point Islay — is about two hundredfeet high — has the appearance of a fort, with two tier ofguns, and is perfectly white ; the adjacent coast to the west is dark,and forms a bay ; and on the east are low black cliffs ; with ashes onthe top extending half-way up the hills. If the weather be clear,the valley of Quilca may be seen, which is the first green spot westof Tambo. Cornelius, however, must be searched for, and whenabreast of it Point Islay vdU be seen, topping to the eastward, as twoislands off a gradual declining point, the sharp hill before-namedin the near range, will also be seen, if favourable weather ; and shortlyafter the town will appear like black spots, in strong relief againstthe white ground, when a course may be shaped for the anchorageunder the white islets, as before. Landing at Islay is far from good ;a sort of mole, composed of a few planks, with a swinging ladderattached to it, enables you generally, with a little management, toget on shore in safety ; but often at the full of the moon vessels aredetained three days or more, without being able to land or take incargo. Fresh provisions may be had on reasonable terms ; but neitherwood nor water can be depended on. There are no fortifications ofany description.The coast between Islay and Point Corner is an irregular black cliff,from fifty to two hundred feet high, bounded by scattered rocks tothe distance of a cable's length ; about two leagues from Islay is acove, called MoUendito, the residence of a few fishermen : thereis a similar cove a little to the eastward of Point Corner. Westwardof that point the coast retires and forms a shallow bay, inwhich are three small coves — Aranta, La Gutta, and Orator ; andW. 36° N., thirteen miles distant, is the valley and river of Quilca,off which vessels occasionally anchor, under the Seal Rock lying tothe south-east of Quilca Point. This anchorage is much exposed ;but landing is good in the cove westward of the valley. Watering jssometimes attempted, by filling at the river and rafting off, but mustalways be attended with much difficulty and danger. The valley isabout three-quarters of a mile in width, and differing from the others,which are level, rims down the side of a hill; and from the regu-APPENDIX. 245laity of the cliffs by which it is bounded, has the appearance of awork of art.W. 6° N., at the distance of six leagues, is the valley of Canada ;the coast between is nearly straight, \^^th alternate sandy beachand low broken cliff, the termination of the barren hills immediatelyabove. Canada is from two to three miles broad, near the sea ; andapparently well cultivated : the village is situated about a mile fromthe sea ; but is scarcely perceptible, being small, and surroundedby thick brushwood.On approaching from the eastward, a remarkable cliff, resemblinga fort, will be seen near the sea ; this is an excellent guide till thevalley becomes open. There is anchorage in ten or twelve fathoms,muddy bottom, due south about a mile ; but landing would be dangerous.W. 18° N., twenty-three miles, is the the valley of Cosa, thenext remarkable place ; it is smaller and less conspicuous than theformer ; but similar in other respects. An islet lies at its southernextreme, and several rocks near the extreme of the cliff, on itseastern side.W. 11° N., fourteen miles, is a projecting bluff point called Pescadores,it has a cove on itsea^t side surrounded by islets ; and off thepoint, at the distance of three quarters of a mile in a southerly direction,lies a rock barely covered: to the westward of the point is a baybut no anchorage ; the coast then runs in nearly a direct line untilyou reach Point Atico, a rugged point, with a number of irregularbroken hillocks on it, barely connected vrith the coast by a sandyisthmus. At a distance it appears like an island, the isthmus notbeing visible far off: there is tolerable anchorage in nineteen ortwenty fathoms on its west side, and excellent landing in a snug coveat the inner extreme of the point. By keeping a cable's length offshore, no danger need be feared in running into this roadstead. Thevalley of the same name Les a league and a half to the eastwardwhere are about thirty houses, scattered among the trees, that growto the height of some twenty feet. From this point the coast continuesits westerly direction (low and broken cUff, with hills immediatelyabove) until you reach Point Cape, where a bay commencesthat runs as far as Point Chala ; in it there are several coves, butnone that could be serviceable to shipping.Point Chala bears from Point Atico W. 20° N. and distant sixteen246 APPENDIX.leagues and a half, is a high rocky point, the termination of theMono, or hill of that name. This mount show's very prominently,and has several summits to it ; on the east side is a valley that separatesit from another lover hiU, with two remarkable paps, and onthe west it slopes suddenly to a sandy plain ; the nearest range ofhills to the westward are thrown in-shore considerably, makingMorro Chala still more conspicuous.W. 26° N., eighteen miles from Point Chala, is Point Having,which appears like a rock on the beach ; between the two is a sandybeach, with Uttle green hillocks and sand-hills ; there are also tworivulets, running from the valleys of Atequipa and Lomas, that areseen in the distance.Half a mile to the westward of Having is a small white islet, anda cluster of rocks level with the water's edge ; hence to the roadsteadof Lomas a sandy beach continues, with regular soundings oifit, at two miles from the shore.Point Lomas projects at right angles to the general trend of thecoast, and, similar to Atico, is all but an island ; it may easily bedistinguished although low, by its marked difference (being blackrock) from the adjacent coast.This road is the port of Acari, affords good anchorage in from fiveto fifteen fathoms, and tolerable landing ; it is the residence of a fewfishermen, and used as a bathing place for the inhabitants of Acari,which, from the information obtained, is a populous town severalleagues in-land. AH supplies, even water, are brought here by thostfwho visit it : the fishermen have a well of brackish water scarcely fitfor use. Boats occasionally call here for otters, which are plentifidatparticular seasons.W. 21° N., twenty-three miles from Lomas Road, is the Harbourof San Juan ; and eight miles further, that of San Nicholas. Theformer is exceedingly good, and fit for a vessel to undergo anyrepairs in, or heaving dora, in case of necessity, without beinginconvenienced by a swell ; but all materials must be brought, as wellas water and fuel, none of which are to be found there.The shore is composed of irregular broken cliffs, and at the headof the bay is a sandy plain ; still the harbour is good, indeed muchbetter than any other on the south-west coast of Peru, and might beanexcellent place to run for if in distress. It may be distinguishedby Mount Acari, a remarkable sugar-loaf hiU, almost perpendicular24)7early over the cliff on the north side of the bay ; and three leaguesto the eastward, a short distance from the coast, a high bluff head,the termination of a range of a table land. Between this bluff andthe harbour the land is low and level, with few exceptions, and has anumber of rocks lying off it to the distance of half a mile.S.W. three-quarters of a mile from Steep Point (the southern pointof the harbour) lies a small black rock, always visible, with a reef ofrocks extending a quarter of a mile to the northward ; and nearly twomiles to the S.E., there is an islet that shows distinctly. A passagemay exist between this reef and the point, but prudence would forbidits being attempted ; the safest plan is to pass to the northward,giving it a berth of a cable's length ; and not close the shore untilwell within the next point (a sunken rock Hes off it), when you mayhaul your wind and work up to the anchorage at the head of the bay,and come to in any depth from five to fifteen fathoms, muddy bottom.In working up, the northern shore may be approached boldly ; it issteep-to, and has no outlying dangers.The harbour of San Nicholas lies N. 41° W, eight miles from SanJuan, is quite as commodious and free from danger as the latter, butthe landing is not so good.Harmless Point may be rounded within a cable ; there are a numberof scattered rocks to the southward of it, but as they all appear,there is no danger to be feared. There are no inhabitants at either ofthese ports, so that vessels wanting any repairs may be sure of notbeing interrupted while so employed.N. 59° W., eight and a half miles from Harmless Point, is PointBeware, high and clifiy, with a number of small rocks and blindbreakers round, and some heights close above it ; from this point thecoast is alternately cliff and small sandy bays, till you reach PointNasca, round which is what has been termed Port Cabals.Point Nasca may be readily distinguished : it is a bluff head of adark brown colour, 1,020 feet in height, with two sharp toppedhummocks of a moderate height at the foot of it ; the coast to thewestward falls back to the distance of two miles, and is composedof white sand hills ; in the depth of this bight is Cabals, a rockyshallow hole, that should only be kno-wn to be avoided ; we lay atanchor in seven fathoms, as far in as it was thought prudent to go,for twenty four hours, without being able to effect a landing : thewind came round the head in heavy gusts, which, combined with the248 APPENDIX.long ground swell, made it doubtful if two anchors would hold us tillour observations where concluded. The only traces we saw of thereever having been any inhabitants at this dreary place, was a polesticking up on the top of a mound, near the head of the bay.N. 64° W., thirteen leagues from Point Rascals Point SantaMaria,and the rock called the Ynfiemillo. This point is low and rugged, surroundedby rocks and breakers. At the distance of a league and ahalf, inland, to the eastward, is a remarkable table topped hill, calledthe table of Dona Maria ; this hill may be seen in clear weather ata considerable distance from seaward, and from its height and peculiarshape is a good mark for this part of the coast.The Ynfiernillo Rock lies due west from the northern extremeof the point, at the distance of a mUe ; it is about fifty feet high,quite black, and in the form of a sugar loaf ; no dangers exist nearit : there are fifty-four fathoms at two mUes distance. Between thisrock and Point Cabals, the coast to a short distance west of thesmall River Yea is a sandy beach, with ranges of moderately highsand hills. From thence to the YnfierniUo it is rocky, with grassycliffs immediately over it, and some small white rocks l5Tng off.N. 31° W., ten and a half miles from Santa Maria, is Point Aqua,a high bluff, with a low rocky point off it; between is a sandybeach, interrupted by rocky projections, and a small stream runningfrom the hills.N. 3° W., from Point Aqua, and at the distance of twenty-onemiles, is the southern entrance to the bay of the Yndependencia.This extensive bay which is fifteen mUes in length in a N.W. andS.E. direction, and three miles and a half broad, has been till of lateyears, completely unknown or overlooked : no mention is made of itin the Spanish charts, and it was not till the year 1825 that theHydrographer at Lima became aware of its existence, and then onlyby an accidental discovery. It has two entrances : the southerncalled Serrate, which takes its name from the master of the vesselby whom it was discovered, is formed by the Island of Santa Rosaon the north, and Point Quemada on the south : it is three quartersof a mile wide and free from danger. The northern entrance isnamed after the Dardo and TruxiUano, two vessels that were coveringtroops to Pisco : they ran in, mistaking it for that place, andwere wrecked : many of the people on board perished. It is formedby Point Carretas on the north and the Island of Vieja on the south.APPENDIX. 249is five miles in width, and clear in all parts. It is bounded on thewest by the Islands of Vieja and of Santa Rosa, and on theeast by the main-land, which is moderately high, cliffy, andbroken by a sandy beach, at the south end of which is a smallfishing village called Mungo. The people of this village are residentsof Yea, the principal town in the province, which is abouttwelve leagues distant; they come here occasionally to fish andremain a few days, bringing with them aU their supplies, even towater, as that necessary of life is not to be obtained in the neighbourhood.There is anchorage in any part of this spacious bay ;the bottom is quite regular, about twenty fathoms all over, exceptingoff the shingle spit on the north-east side of Vieja Island, where isa bank running off that spit to the northward, on which are five andsix fathoms : this is decidedly the best place to anchor, for on theweather shore, near Quemado Point, it blows strong and in suddengusts off the high land, and great difficulty would be found in landing; whereas, at the spit, you are not annoyed by the wind, andthere is a snug cove, or basin, within it, where boats may landorlie ui safety at any time.Approaching this part of the coast from seaward, it may be distinguishedby three clusters of hiUs, Quemado, Vieja Island, andCarretas ; they are nearly of the same height, and at equal distancesfrom one another. The S.W. sides of Morro Carretas and theIsland of Vieja are steep dark cliff, but Morro Quemado slopes graduallyto the water's edge, and is of a much lighter colour. At thesouthern extreme of Vieja Island, is a remarkable black lump ofland, in the shape of a sugar loaf : off which lies the white levelisland of Santa Rosa, the S.W. side of which is studded with rocksand breakers, but there is no danger a mUe from the shore.N. 35° W., six leagues and a half from the north head, or PointCarretas, is theBoqueron, or southern entrance to the Bay of Pisco ;between the two is a deep angular bay, with the Island of Ratenear its centre. The Boqueron is formed by the main land on theeast, and the Island of San Gallan on the west ; this island is twomiles and one-third long in a north and south direction, and onemile in breadth : it is high, with a bold chffy outHne. There is adeep valley dividing the hUls ; which when seen from the south-west,gives it the appearance of a saddle ; the south extreme terminatingabruptly, while at its northern end it slopes more gradually and has250 APPENDIX.several peaks on it. Off this end are some detached rocks, the northernof which has the appearance of a nine-pin, and shews distinctly.S. J E., at the distance of a mile from its south extreme, liesthe Piero Rock, which is much in the way of vessels bound toPisco from the southward; it is just level with the water's edge,and in fine weather can always be seen; but when it blows hard(which it sometimes does through this channel) and a weathertide is running, there is such a confused cross sea that the wholespace is covered with foam, rendering it difficult to distinguish therock ; at such a time the shore should be kept well aboard on eitherside, and when in a line with the outer extreme of the island andthe white rock off Point Huacas, you vdU be within the rock andmay steer for Point Paracca ; on rounding which you will open theBay of Pisco.This extensive bay, formed by the Peninsula of Paracca on thesouth, and the Ballista and Chincha Islands on the west, is theprincipal port of the province of Yea. The to^vn of Pisco is built onthe east side, about a mile from the sea ; and is said to contain threethousand inhabitants, who derive considerable profit from a spiritthey distil, known by the name of Pisco or Italia, great quantitiesof which are annually exported to different parts of the coast : sugaris also an article of trade, but the pico is the staple commodity.Refreshment may be obtained on reasonable terms : wood is scarce :excellent water may be had at the head of Caracas Bay, under thesouth cluster of trees, two miles from the fishing village of Paracca :the landing there is very good, and the wells are near the beach.The best anchorage off the town is vnth. the church open of theroad, bearing E. 14° N., in four fathoms, muddy bottom, three-quartersof a mile from the shore. A heavy surf beats on the beachwith rollers to the distance of a quarter of a mUe off, rendering itdangerous to land in ship's boats ; launches built for the purposeare used in loading and discharging vessels ; but at times even thesecannot stand it, and all communication is cut off for two or threedays together.There are four entrances to this capacious bay : that to the southwardalready named; between San Gallan and the Ballista Islands;between those and the Chincha Islands ; and the great or northernentrance ; aU of which, from appearances, may be safely used ; but.APPENDIX. 251between the islands, time would not allow a Ml examination, and,therefore, there may be dangers that were unseen by us.In coming from the southward, after passing Point Paracca, acourse may be shaped midway between Blancaa Island and the churchof Pisco, which will be seen distinctly : this will lead directly to theanchorage. A mile and a half round Point Paracca is a bay, offwhich a shoal patch extends, with four fathoms on it ; the tail ofthis bank will be passed in standing towards the anchorage, thewater then deepens suddenly, and when abreast of Blancaa Islandyou will have twelve fathoms muddy bottom ; from this depth itdecreases gradually to the anchorage.In coming from the northward it is all plain sailing ; after passingthe Chincha Islands stand in boldly to the anchorage ; the watershoals quicker on this side Blancaa Island, but there is no dangerwhatever. Vessels having to ballast here, should work up andanchor under Shingle Point ; they can lie close to the shore, andboats may load with expedition.In coming from seaward this part of the coast may easily beknovm by the Island of San Gallan, and the high Peninsula ofParacca at the back of it, which make like large islands, the landon each side being considerably lower and failing back to the eastward,so as not to be visible at a moderate distance. As the shore -is approached the Chincha and Ballista Islands will be seen ; whichwill confirm the position, there being no other islands lying off thecoast about this parallel.From Pisco the coast runs in a northerly direction, a low sandybeach with regular soundings oiF it, till you reach the River Chincha;from thence commences a clay cliffy coast, which continues as far asthe River Canute. From this river to Point Frayle is a beautifuland fertile valley, in the middle of which is situated the town ofCerto Azul. This valley produces rum, sugar, and chancaca, asort of treacle, for which it is resorted to by coasters. The anchorageis W.N.W. from the bluff that forms the cove, three-quartersof a mile distant, in seven fathoms ; nearer the shore the water isshoal, which causes a long swell ; the landing place is on the northernside of the point, on a stony beach, where a heavy surf is constantlybreaking.N. 39° W., fifteen miles from Cerro Azul, lies the Island of Asia.a round, white islcuid, about a mile in circumference, with some rocksz 2APPENDIX.extending from it to the shore. Between the two is a bay, hutscarcely affording anchorage. The coast line is partly a rocky andpartly a sandy beach ; in-shore are hOls about fourteen hundredfeet in height, inclining gradually toward the coast.N. 41° W., twenty miles from Asia Island, is Chilca Point; it isabout three hundred feet in its highest part, has several rises on it,and terminates in a steep cUfF, with a small flat rock close off it.The valley of Chilca hes a league to the southward of the point,and the harbour of the same name half a league to the northward.This is a snug cove, but very confined ; anchorage is good in any partof it, and landing tolerable ; there is a small village at the head ofthe bay, but no information could be obtained from the inhabitantsabout Chilca, for they deserted their huts on our arrival.From Chilca the coast forms a bend to about the Valley of Lierin,off which are the Pachacamac Islands. The northern is thelargest, half a mile in length, and about a cable's length broad ; thenext but one to it is the most remarkable, being quite Hke a sugar-loaf,perfectly rounded at the top : the others are mere rocks, andnot visible at any distance. At the northern end of these islandslies a small reef, even with the water's edge : the group run nearlyparallel to the coast, in a N.W. and S.E. direction, and are about aleague in extent. There is no danger on their outer side, buttowards the shore the water is shoal, which causes a long swell, thatat times must break. Between these islands and the Morro Solar isa sandy beach, with moderately high land a short distance fromthe sea. The Morro Solar is a remarkable cluster of hOls, situatedon a sandy plain ; when seen from the southward it has the appearanceof an island in the shape of a quoin, sloping to the westward,and falling abruptly on its in-shore side ; facing the sea it terminatesin a steep cliff, and has a sandy bay on each side of it.Off the point of the southern sand bay is an islet with somerocks lying about it, and off the point of the northern sand bay isa reef of rocks of about a cable's length ; round this reef, on thenorth side of the Morro, is the town and road of ChoriUos. Thetown of ChoriUos, built on the cliff, at the foot of one of theslopes of the Morro Solar, is used chiefly as a bathing-place for theinhabitants of Lima, and during a revolution its road is filled withthe shipping from Callao ; though it is an exceedingly bad place forthem : the bottom is a hard sand, with patches of hard stony clayAPPENDIX. ■ 253mixed together, called tosca ; and the heavy swell that sets roundthe point causing almost a roller, brings a vessel up to her anchorand throws her back again with a sudden jerk, each of which makesher drag, or endangers snapping the cable.Vessels having to anchor here ought not to shut the southern pointthe Morro in with the next point to the northward : by keeping thismark open they will be in eight or nine fathoms, and not have somuch swell as there is further in. The landing is very bad ; canoesbuilt purposely and dexterously managed are the usual means of communication: no doubt there are times when a ship's boat may landwithout danger, but very seldom probably without the crew beingthoroughly drenched. From ChoriUos the coast runs in a steadysweep with cliffs of less height, tiU it reaches the Point of Callao,which is a shingle spit, stretching out toward the Island of SanLorenzo, and with it forms the extensive and commodious Bay ofCallao.The Island of San Lorenzo, which is 1050 feet at its highestpart, is four miles and a half long, in a N.W. and S.E. direction,and one mile broad. OiF its S.E. end lies a small but bold-lookingisland, called Front, and to the S.W. are the Palominas rocks :its northern end, or Cape San Lorenzo, is clear, and round it is theusual passage to the anchorage at Callao. In rounding this Cape donot close the land nearer than half a mile, for within that distancethere are Hight baffling airs caused by the eddy wind round the island ;by getting among which you would be more delayed than if yougave the island a good berth, and should have to make an additionaltack to fetch the anchorage.This is the usual route ; but there is another which, with commonprecaution, may be used to great advantage, by vessels comingfrom the southward. This is the Boqueron, formed by the Island ofSan Lorenzo and CaUao Point. After making San Lorenzo andFront, steer so as to keep the south extreme of the latter about apoint open on the bow port ; and keep on this course until CallaoCastle is seen, which has two martel towers on it, and is situatedon the inner part of the shingle spit, that forms the point : then steerfor it till Horadada Island (with a hole through it) comes on withthe middle of the southern sandy bay of the Morro Solar, and withthe inner declivity of the hill on Solar Point bearing S. 66° E. : withthese marks on, and steering N. 66° W., for the furthest point ofAPPENDIX.Lorenzo you can see, you will be clear of all danger ; and when thewest martel tower in the castle comes on with the northern part ofCaUao spit, bearing N. 49° E., you may haul gradually round, tillthe same tower is seen to the northward of the breakers on a shoallying oiF the spit ; when a direct course may be shaped for the anchorage.There is no regular tide in this passage, but generally a littlesetting directly through, sometimes to the N.W. and at othersthe contrary ; shoved the stream be adverse, and it fall calm while inthe channel, there is good anchorage in eight or nine fathoms, withthe leading marks on.Callao is well known as the sea-port of Lima, which is sevenmiles inland, situated five hundred feet above the level of the sea,and at the foot of a range of mountains : when seen from the anchorageon a fine day, it has an imposing appearance.Trade was in a flourishing condition in 1 836, and when the governmentbecomes settled, this may be the first commercial port on thewest coast of South America.Supplies of all sorts may be obtained for shipping ; fresh provisionsas well as vegetables, with an abundance of fruit : wateringis also extremely convenient, a well-constructed mole being run outinto the sea, at which boats can lie and fill from the pipes projectingfrom its side ; wood is the scarcest article, and very dear, 9othat vessels likely to remain at this port should husband their fuelaccordingly.From Callao, the coast is a sandy beach, running in a northerlydirection until you reach Point Vernal ; it there becomes higher andclifiy, which character continues as far as Point Mutatis, roimdwhich is the little bay of Ancon.To the west and south-west of Ancon lie the Pescador Islands,the outer and largest of which bears N. 31° W. from Callao Castle,and at the distance of eighteen mUes. There is no danger amongthese islands ; they are steep-to, with from twenty to thirty fathomsnear them.N. 33° W. from Point Mutatis, twelve miles distant, is the Bayof Chancay and river of that name ; this bay may be known by thebluff" head that forms the point, and has three hills on it, in an easterlydirection ; it is a confined place, and fit only for small coasters.From Chancay, the coast runs in a more westerly direction, as far asPoint Salinas, a shingle beach, with a few broken, clifiy points ; theAPPENDIX. 255hills are near the coast, and from four hundred to five hundredfeet high.The point or head of Salinas is five miles in length, in a north andsouth direction ; off its southern extreme is a reef of rocks, a quarterof a mile from the shore ; and at its northern part, called Las Rajas,is an islet at a cable's distance ; between these points are two covesfit only for boats ; there is a remarkable round hill, called Salinas,at a short distance from the coast, and further in shore, is a level,sandy plain ; at the south side of this plain is a number of salinas,or salt-ponds, from which the headland takes its name. These pondsare visited occasionally by people from Huacho.Off the south part of Salinas, in a south-west direction, lie the HaraIslands, the largest of which is called Mazorque. It is two hundredfeet in height, three-quarters of a mile long, and quite white ;sealers occasionally frequent this island ; there is landing on its northside.The next in size is called Place ; it lies S. 49° W. six miles anda half from Mazorque, is about one hundred and fifty feet high, andapparently quite round ; between these two islands a safe passageexists, and may be used without fear in working up to Callao. BetweenMazorque and Salinas are several smaller islands, all of which,from their appearance, may be approached without danger ; but asno advantage could be gained, it would not be prudent to risk goingbetween them. Vessels, in working up, sometimes go between theinner one and the point ; but what they gain by so doing doesnot appear, for when the current sets to the southward, it runsequally as strong between Mazorque and Place as it does nearer theshore.Round the northern point of Salinas Head is the bay of that name,of large dimensions, and affording anchorage. From this bay thecoast is moderately high and cliffy, without any break, until youreach the Bay of Huacho. This bay lies round a bluff head, is small ;but the anchorage is good in five fathoms, just within the two rocksthat run off the northern part of the head. The town is built abouta mile from the coast, in the midst of a fertile plain, and in comingfrom seaward has a pleasant appearance ; it is not a place of muchtrade, but whale-ships find it useful for watering and refreshing theircrews. Fresh provisions, vegetables, and fruit, are abundant and onreasonable terms ; wood is also plentiful, and a stream of fresh water256 APPENDIX.runs down the side of the clifF into the sea. Landing is tolerablygood : rafting seems to be the best method of watering.In coming from seaward, the best distinguishing marks for thisplace, are the Beagle Mountains, three in number, in the nearrange, each of which has two separate peaks on it ; these liedirectly over the bay, and on closing the land, the rornid hiU on SalinasPoint and the Island of San Martin to the northward, will beseen ; about midway between them is the Bay of Huacho, under alight brown cliff, the top of which is covered with brushwood : to thesouthward the coast is a dark, rocky cMfF.N. 29° W., three miles and two-thirds from Huacho, are the Headand Bat of Tarquin, scarcely as large as Huacho, and apparentlyshoal and useless to shipping ; off the Head, which is a steep cliff,with a sharp-topped hiU on it, are some rocks above water, and an isletabout three-quarters of a mile distant. N. 31° W. three miles fromthis islet is the island of San Martin, and round to the northward ofthe point abreast of it, is the Bay of Bequest.This is no place for a vessel, being full of rocks and breakers, andhaving nothing to induce one to go there. From this bay the coast ismoderately high, with sandy outline, until you reach Point Atahuan-qui. This is a steep point, with two mounds on it, and is partly whiteon its south side : there is a small bay on its north side, fit only forboats. Between this point and the south part of Point Thomasthe coast forms a sandy bay, low and shrubby ; with the town ofSupe about a mile from the sea.Point Thomas is similar in appearance to Atahuanqui, without thewhite on the south side. To the northward of this Point is a snuglittle bay, capable of containing four or five sal; it is called theBay of Supe, and is the port of that place and Barranca.There is a fishing village at the south part of it, which is usedby the inhabitants of Barranca during the bathing season. Hithertoit had been a forbidden port by the government : in consequence ofwhich it is little known, and has had few opportunities of exchangingits produce for the goods of other countries. When we were there,little information could be gained as to the size of the neighbouringtowns, and number of inhabitants they contain ; but from their appearancewe thought they might be of considerable extent. These placesproduce chiefly sugar and com, cargoes of which are taken in thevarious little vessels that trade along the coast. Refreshments mayAPPENDIX. 257be obtained ; but water is scarce, alae greater part of which is broughtfrom Supe, for the use of the inhabitants of the village.The best anchorage is in four fathoms, with Point Thomas shut inby the inner point, about a cable's length from the rocks runningoff that point, and rather more than a quarter of a mile from thevillage. There is good anchorage further out, in six or seven fathoms,but little sheltered from the swell. In entering, there is no danger ;Point Thomas is bold, with regular soundings, from ten to fifteenfathoms three-quarters of a mile off it. Off Inner Point there are afew rocks to a short distance ; but there is no necessity for huggingthe shore so close, as you can always fetch the anchorage, by keepingat a moderate distance in standing in.To distinguish this port, the best guide at a distance is the BellMountain, the highest and most remarkable mountain in the secondrange ; it bears from the anchorage E. 39° N. ; may be distinguishedby its shape like a bell, and has three distinct rises on its summit —the highest at the north end ; on that side it shews very distinctly,there being no other hiUs near it for a considerable distance. Onapproaching the coast, the island of San Martin to the southward,and Mount Darwin and Cerro Horsa (a small round hill on the beach,with a steep, chffy side to it, facing the sea, with apparently an isletoff it), will be seen, nearly four leagues to the northward. The harbouritself has a white rock at its north extreme, and cannot bemistaken, for there is no other like it near this part of the coast.From Supe the coast is a clay cuff, about a hundred feet Ln height,to the distance of a league and a half; it then becomes low andcovered with brushwood, until you reach Cerro Horsa already mentioned; here it again becomes holy near the sea, with alternate rockypoints and small sandy bays, which continue to the distance of sixleagues ; where is the bay called Gramadel.This is a vnld-looking place, with a heavy swell rolling in ; it isvisited occasionally for the hair seal, with which it abounds : there isanchorage in six or seven fathoms, sandy bottom, with the bluff thatforms the bay bearing S.S.E. about half a mUe from the shore ;but landing is scarcely practicable.The coast maintains its rocky character, vdth deep water off it, asfar as the Buffadero, a high, steep cliff, vidth a hill having two papson it, a little in-shore. From this bluff is a rocky cliff, from twohundred to three hundred feet high, and more level country, as far asPoint Lepanto, round which is the Port of Gurney.268 APPENDIX.This is a tolerable harbour, with good anchorage any where infrom three and a half to ten fathoms, over a fine sandy bottom.Fire-wood is the principal commodity, for which it is the best andcheapest place on the whole coast. Vessels of considerable burthentouch here for that article, which they carry up to CaUao, and derivegreat profit from its sale. There are also some saltpetre works,established by a Frenchman, but little business is done in that line.The town Hes in a north-easterly direction, about two miles from theanchorage, but is hid by the surrounding trees, which grow to theheight of thirty feet. It has only one street, and cannot contain morethan five or six hundred inhabitants. At the anchorage there is asmall house, used to transact business, but no other building, whichis unusual, as at most of these places there is a small village nearthe sea. Large stacks of wood are piled up on the beach, ready forembarking.Fresh provisions, vegetables, and fruit, are plentiful and moderate ;but water is not to be depended on. It is true, there is a river, andfor several months after March there is a plentiful supply ; but inthe summer season there is sometimes great drought. At the timewe were there, a whale-ship put in to supply her wants, and had toremain several days, waiting for the water to come down from themountains.Legarto Head is a steep cliff, with the land falling immediatelyinside it and rising again to about the same height. In saying in,after having passed the head, a small, white islet will be seen in themiddle of the bay ; steer for it, that you may not border on thesouthern shore, for there are many straggling rocks running off thepoints ; and when sufficiently far to the northward to shape a mid-channelcourse between the white islet and the point opposite it, tothe southward, do so, and it will lead to the anchorage. In standingin, in this direction, the water shoals gradually to the beach ; butthe southern shore must on no account be approached nearer than aquarter of a mUe.The best anchorage is in four fathoms, with Harbour Islet bearingN. 26° W., and the ruins of a fort on a hUl in-shore E. 5° N. abouta quarter of a mile from the landing-place on the beach. This does not seem to be so good a one as a steep rock on theouter side of the bluff, where the sand beach commences ; but probablyit is the most convenient for loading boats.The rise and faU of tide is irregular, and the time of high waterAPPENDIX, 259uncertain; but, generally speaking, three feet may be consideredabout the extent to which it ranges. The sea breeze sets in sostrongly occasionally, that it is difficult for boats to pull against it ;this is particularly the case under the high land, whence it comesin sudden gusts and squalls.In coming from seaward, the best way to make this port is tostand in on a parallel of 10° 06', and when within a few leagues ofthe coast, a sharp-peaked hill, with a large white mark on it, will beseen standing alone a little north of the port : the break in thehills through which the river runs, is high and clifiy on each side.The land is also much lower to the northward of Legarto Head;and there is a large white islet at the north end of Gurney Bay.N. 34° W., seven miles and a half from the white islet at thenorth extreme of Gurney Bay, is Point Culebras, a level projectingpoint, similar in appearance to Legarto Head, as seen from thenorthward ; the coast between is a mass of broken cliffs and innumerabledetached rocks, with moderately high land near the coast.On the north side of Point Culebras, there is anchorage off thevalley of that name. From this point the coast is rocky, with smallsandy bays, and some rocks lying off it about three quarters of amile ; there is also a white clifiy islet, five miles to the northward ofCulebras ; whence the coast takes a bend inwards, forming bay,and then runs out towards the Colin Deronda ; a point with twohummocks on it, and as seen from the southward, appearing Hke anisland. On the north side of this point is the Caleta (only fit forboats) ; and immediately over it, the Cerro Mongon.The Cerro Mongon is the highest and most conspicuous object onthis part of the coast ; when seen from the westward it has the appearanceof being round, with rather a sharp summit ; but from thesouthward, it shows as a long hUl with a peak at each end. It issaid there is a lake of fresh water on its summit, and that its valleysabound with deer ; but the truth of this cannot be vouched for, asour examination did not extend so far.From Mongon there is a range of hills running parallel to thecoast (which is high and rocky, with some white islets lying off it)as far as Casma, where they terminate in a steep rocky bluff, thatforms the southern head of the port of that name.The Bay of Casma is a snug anchorage, something in the form ofa horse-shoe ; at its entrance it is a mile and three quarters in aAPPENDIX.N.W. and S.E. direction, and a mile and a half deep from the outerpart of the cheek, with regular soundings from fifteen to ten, andthree fathoms near the beach. ^,The best anchorage is with the inner part of the south cheek, bearingabout S.S.E. a quarter of a mile off shore, in seven fathoms water ;by not going farther in you escape, in a great measure, the suddengusts of wind that at times come do^^m the valley with great violence.Captain Ferguson, of H.M.S. Mersey, mentions a rock withnine feet water on it, on the south side, half a mUe from the shore,that sometimes breaks : we saw nothing of it while we were there,but doubtless it exists.This place seemed quite deserted ; the only things that indicatedits ever having been visited, were a few stacks of wood piled up onthe beach.The best distinguishing mark for Casma, is the sandy beach in thebay, with the sand hills in-shore of it contrasting strongly with thehard dark rocks, of which the heads at the entrance are formed :there is also a small black islet lying a Httle to the westward of it.From Casma the coast takes rather a more westerly direction, butcontinues bold and rocky.N. 44° W., five leagues from Casma, is the Harbour of Samanco,or Hu/^MBACHo ; midway between them is a bay, almost hidden bytwo islands that lie across the entrance : this bay is four miles longand two miles deep ; but as the Bay of Samanco is so near at hand,it was not examined by us as to its capabilities.The Bay of Samanco is the most extensive on the coast to thenorthward of Callao ; it is two leagues in length, in a N.W. andS.E. direction, and a league and a half wide : at its entrance it istwo miles wide, formed by Point Samanco on the south, and SealIsland on the north, and has regular soundings all over it.At the S.E. comer, in a sandy bay, is a small village (the residenceof some fishermen), situated at the termination of the RiverNepena. This river, like most on the coast, has not sufficientstrength to force a passage for itself through the beach, but terminatesin a lagoon within a few yards of the sea.The tovra of Huambacho is the nearest place to this bay ; it liesabout a league distant, at the east extreme of the valley. Pena,which is the principal town, lies to the north-east about five leaguesoff. Tliere is very little trade at this place ; small coasting vesselsAPPENDIX. 261from Payta sometimes call here with a mixed cargo, and they get inexchange sugar and a Httle grain.Refreshment may be obtained from the neighbouring towns, butwood is scarce. The water of the river is brackish and unfit for use ;but there are wells on the left bank, a short distance from the huts.When taken on board, this water is not good ; but, contrary to thegeneral ride, after it has been some time confined on board, it becomeswholesome and pleasant tasted.When at a distance, the best mark to distinguish this bay, is MountDivision, a hill with three sharp peaks, situated on the peninsula betweenSamanco and the Bay of Ferrol. There is also a bell shapedhiU on the south side of the bay that shows very distinctly.Mount Tortuga, a short distance inland to the N.N.E., will alsobe seen : it is higher, and similar in appearance to the Bell Mount.The south entrance point is a steep bluff, with some rocks lying offit to a cable's length ; on opening the bay. Leading Bluff will be seen,a large lump of rock on the sandy beach at the Nee. side, that lookslike an island. In going in, give Samanco Head a berth in passing ;you may then stand in as close as convenient to the weather shore,and anchor off the village in four, five, or six fathoms, sandy bottom :when rounding the inner points, take care of your small spars ; forthe wind comes off the BeU Mount in sudden and variable puffs.N. 43° W., three leagues from Samanco, is the entrance to theBay of Ferrol, nearly equal in size to Samanco, and separated fromit by a low sandy isthmus ; it is an excellent place for a vessel tocareen, being entirely free from the swell that sets into most of theports. On its Nee. side is the Indian village of Chimbote, where,we were told, refreshment of any kind might be had, but no water.The entrance is clear ; but there is a reef of rocks off Blancaa Island,half a mile to the northward, which must be avoided.N. 40° W., two leagues from the entrance of Ferrol, is SantaIsland : about a mile and a half in length ; lying N.N.E. andS.S.W., and of a very white colour ; just without it are two sharp-pointedrocks, twenty feet above the sea. Two miles N.N.E. fromthe island is Santa Head, on the north side of which is the harbourof that name. This, although small, is a tolerable harbour ; the bestanchorage is in four or five fathoms, with the extreme of the headbearing S.W. Fresh provisions and vegetables may be obtained onmoderate terms. It is also a tolerable place for watering.262 APPENDIX.The town lies west from the anchorage, about two miles distant ;and the mouth of the river is a mUe and a half along the beach.This is the largest and most rapid river on the coast of Peru : fromSanta Head it is seen to wind its way down the valley, with severalislets interrupting its course ; but at its termination it branches offand becomes shallow, with only sufficient strength to make a narrowoutlet for itself, through the sandy beach that forms the coast line :a heavy and dangerous surf lies off it ; so that no boat could approachvdth any degree of safety.This part of the coast may be known by the wide spreading valleydown which the river runs, bounded on each side by ranges of sharp-toppedhiUs ; and as you approach, Santa Island will be plainly seen ;with the Head of the same name ; there is also a small but remarkablewhite island, called Corcovado, to the N.W. of the harbour.There is no danger in entering ; the soundings are regular for somedistance outside ; and you may anchor any where between the islandsin a moderate depth of water, but of course exposed to the swell.N. 39° W., five leagues from Santa, lie the Chao Islands, one mileand three quarters off the point and hill of that name. The largestis a mUe in circumference, about one hundred and twenty feet high,and, like most of these islands, quite white ; there are regular soundingsfrom ten to twenty fathoms, at the distance of a mile off shore.Between Santa and Chao the coast is a low sandy beach, whichcontinues and forms a shallow bay, as far as the hill of Guanape,with moderately high land a few miles in-shore.The hill of Guanape is about three hundred feet high ; rathersharp at its summit, and when seen from the southward, appears likean island ; on the north side of it is a small cove, with tolerablelanding just inside the rock that hes off the point.S. 8° W. from this point, between six and seven miles from thecoast, lie the Guanape Islands, with a safe passage between themand the shore ; they may be said to be two, with some islets androcks lying about them ; the southern is the highest and most conspicuous.From the hiU of Guanape the coast continues a sandy beach, withregular soundings ; and ranges of high sharp-topped hills, abouttwo leagues from the sea, until you near the little hiU of Carretas,which is on the beach, and has Morro Garita de Mocha overlookingit. Here commences the valley of Chime, about the middle of whichAPPENDIX. 263is situated the city of Truxillo, and at the northern extreme, thevillage and road of Huanchaco. This is a bad place for shipping,and seems to have been badly chosen : the north side of the hUl ofCarretas is a much better place for landing and embarking goods ; andmight be farther improved by sinking some small craft laden withstones, plenty of which the hill would afford.The road of Huanchaco is on the north side of a few rocks thatrun out from a chffy projection ; sheltering the land in a slight degree,but affording no protection to shipping. The village is underthe cliff, and not distinguishable till to the northward of the point ;but the church, which is on the rising ground, shows very distinctly,and is a good guide when near the coast.The usual anchorage is with the church and a tree that standsin the village in one, bearing about east, a mile and a quarter fromthe shore, in seven fathoms dark sand and mud. Vessels often haveto weigh or slip and stand off, owing to the heavy swell that setsin : it is also customary to sight your anchor once in the twenty-fourhours, to prevent its being imbedded so firmly as to requiremuch time to weigh it when required.Landing cannot be effected in ship's boats ; there are launches constructedfor the purpose, manned by Indians of the village, who areskilful in the management of them : they come off on your arrival,and will land you safely, for which they charge six dollars, equal toone pound four shillings sterling : it is to be remembered that nomore is charged for a cargo of goods ; their having to risk the surfbeing that for which you pay.Fresh provisions may be had from Truxillo, but watering is out ofthe question. The city is said to contain 4,000 inhabitants. Rice isthe principal production of the valley ; for that article and specieit is that vessels call here.If bound for this road, you should stand in on a parallel of 8°,(which is a mile to windward), and you drill see Mount Campania, abell-shaped mount, standing alone, about two leagues to the northward: and Huanchaco Peak, which is very sharp, and the first hUlin the range on the north side of the valley. Shortly after thechurch vtdU come in sight, and the shipping in the road.The coast is cliffy for a few miles to the northward of Huanchaco ;the low sandy soil with bushes on it then commences, with regularsoundings off it, and continues as far as Malabrigo Road. This bay264 APPENDIX.although bad, is considerably preferable to Huanchaco ; it is formedby a cluster of hiUs, projecting beyond the general trend of thecoast, which at a distance appear like an island ; there is a fishingvillage at the S.E. side, but no trade is carried on. The townof Paysan lies some leagues to the S.E., and, by the account theygave of it at Malabrigo, must be of considerable extent.The best anchorage here is vidth the village bearing about E.S.E.,three-quarters of a mile from the shore, in four fathoms sandy bottom: landing is bad, but the fishermen have what they call ' ,'bunches of reed fastened together, turned up at the bow likea balsa of ChUe, but much higher. These are so light that theyare thro-wth on the top of the surf to the beach, when they jump offand carry them on their shoulders to the huts. It seems that eachdifferent bay or road has its peculiarly-constructed vessel, adapted tothe surf which it has to go through. The small island of MirabilisS. by E. two leagues from Malabrigo, with a safe channelof ten fathoms between it and the main land.N. 35° W., six leagues and a half from Malabrigo, is the road ofPacasmayo ; between the two the coast is low and cliffy, with asandy beach at the foot of the cuff, and soundings of nine and tenfathoms two miles off shore. Pacasmayo is a sufficiently good roadstead,under a projecting sandy point, with a flat running off it tothe distance of a quarter of a mile. The best anchorage is with thepoint bearing about S. by E., and the village east ; you will therehave five fathoms, sand and mud : there is no danger in standingin ; the soundings are regular, shoaling gradually towards the shore.Landing is difficult : launches are used as at Huanchaco. The principalexport is rice, which is brought from the town of San Pedrode Loco, two leagues inland. Fresh provisions may also be obtainedfrom the same place ; wood and water may be had at the village onthe beach, which is principally inhabited by Indians, employed bythe merchants of San Pedro.To distinguish this road from seaward, the best guide is to standin on a parallel of 7° 25' to 30', and when thin six leagues, thehill of Malabrigo will be seen, which appears like an island slopinggradually on each side ; and a little to the northward. Arcana Hi,rugged with sharp peaks. As you approach, the low yellow cliffswin appear (those north of the road the highest), on the summit ofwhich, on the north side of the point, is a dark square budding thatAPPENDIX. 265shews very distinctly. The best mark for the anchorage is the shipping,when any are there. From this road the coast continues low,with broken cliff, until you reach Point Eten, whiUch is a double hiU(the southern one the highest), with a steep cliff facing the sea.The north side of this cliff is white, and shews conspicuously.N. 43° W., a Httle more than four leagues, is the road of Lam-bayeux,the worst anchorage on the coast of Peru. There is asmall village on the rising ground, with a church that shews whitetowards the sea ; off which vessels anchor in five fathoms, a mileand a quarter from the shore. The bottom is a hard sand, and badholding ground, it is always necessary to have two anchors ready,for the heavy swell that sets on this beach renders it almost impossibleto bring up with one, particularly after the sea breezesets in.Rice is the chief commodity for which vessels touch here : theonly method of discharging or taking in a cargo (or in fact landingat all), is by means of the balsa. This is a raft of nine logs of thecabbage palm, secured together by lashings, with a platform raisedabout two feet, on which the goods are placed. Tliey have a largelug sail which is used in landing, the wind being along the shoreenables them to run through the surf and on the beach with ease andsafety ; and it seldom happens that any damage is sustained by thispeculiar mode of proceeding. Supplies of fresh provisions, fruit,and vegetables may be obtained, but neither wood nor water.The coast continues low and sandy, similar in appearance to thatof Lambayeque, to the distance of twenty-five leagues : an extensiverange of table-land of considerable height, with broken rocky points,then commences, and continues to Point Aguja or the Needle.Fifteen leagues from Lambayeque in an E.S.E. direction, lies a smallgroup of islands called Lobos de Afuera. These islands are aleague in length north and south, and a mile and a half broad ; areabout a hundred feet high, of a mixed brown and white colour, andmay be seen several leagues off ; they are quite barren, affordingneither wood nor water. There is a cove on the north side formed bythe two principal islands, but with deep water and rocky bottom ;within this cove are several nooks, in which a small vessel mightcareen, without being interrupted by the swell.These islands are resorted to by fishermen from Lambayeque ontheir balsas ; they carry all their necessaries with them, and remaina aSG(j Appendix.about a month salting fish, M'hich fetch a high price at Lambayeque.There is no danger round these islands, at the distance of a mile ;regular soundings will be found between them and the shore, fromfifty fathoms abreast of the islands.N. 26° W., ten leagues from Lobos de Afuera, lies the Island ofLoBo's DE TiEEEA, nearly two leagues in length, north and south,and little more than two miles wide ; when seen from seaward it hasasimilar appearance to the former islands, and many rocks andblind breakers lie round it, particularly on the west side. There istolerable anchorage on the Nee. side, in eleven or twelve fathoms,sand and broken shells. A safe passage is said to exist betweenthis island and the main, which is distant ten miles, but as no advantagecould be gained by going between, it was not thoroughly examinedby us.Point Aguja is long and level, terminating in a steep bluff 150feet high, and has a finger rock a short distance off it, with severaldetached rocks round the point.Three miles and a half N.N.E. of this is Point Noniira, and fivemiles farther in the same direction is Point Pisura, the south pointof the Bas' of Sechura ; between Aguja and Point Pisura are twosmall bays, where anchorage may be obtained, if required. The landabout this part is much higher, and has deeper water off it, than oneither side, and may be readily known by its regularity and table-top.The bay of Sechura is twelve leagues in length, formed by thelittle Lobos Island of Payta and Point Pisura, and is six leaguesdeep ; on the S.E. side the coast shows low sand hills, but as yougo northward it becomes chffy and considerably higher.Near the centre of the bay is the entrance to the River Piura, andthe tovra of Sechura situated on the banks of it. This town is inhabitedchiefly by Indians, who carry on a considerable trade in salt,which they take to Payta on their balsas, and sell to the shipping.The river is small, but of sufficient size to admit the balsas when laden.There is anchorage any where off the town, in from twelve to fivefathoms, coarse sand ; in the latter depth you will be better than amile from the shore. This place may easily be distinguished by thechurch, which has two high steeples on it, and shows conspicuouslyabove the surrounding sand hills ; one of these steeples has a considerableinclination to the northward, which at a distance £rives itmore the appearance of a cocoa-nut tree than a stone building.APPENDIX. 267From Lobos Island Point the coast is cliffy, about 120 feet high,and continues so as far as Payta Point, which is three leagues distant ;between these two, a mile and a half from the coast, is a cluster ofhills called the saddle of Payta ; accurately described by CaptainBasil Hall. The Silla or Saddle of Payta is sufficiently remarkable,it is high and peaked, forming three clusters of peaks joinedtogether at the base, the middle being the highest ; the two northernones are of a dark brown colour ; the southern is the lowest, and of alighter browTi. These peaks rise out of a level plain, and are anexcellent guide to vessels boimd for the Port of Payta from the southward.A few leagues to the northward, as already mentioned, is PaytaPoint, round which is the port of that name. This is without exceptionthe best harbour on the coast, and considerable trade is carriedon. Vessels of all nations touch here for cargoes, principally cotton,bark, hides, and drugs, in return for which they bring the manufacturesof their several countries. In the year 1835 upwards offorty thousand tons of shipping anchored in this port. Communicationwith Europe (via Panama) is more expeditious than at any ofthe other ports.The town is built on the slope and at the foot of the hill, on thesouth-east side of the bay ; at a distance it is scarcely visible, thehouses being of the same colour with the surrounding cliff. It issaid to contain 5,000 inhabitants, and is the sea port of the provinceof Piura, the population of which is estimated at 75,000 souls.The City of San Miguel de Piura is situated on the banks ofthe River Piura, in an easterly direction from Payta, between nieand ten leagues distant. Fresh provisions may be had at Payta onreasonable terms, but neither wood nor water, except at a highprice, the latter being brought from Colin (a distance of four miles)for the inhabitants of the place. When we were there hopes wereentertained of a supply of water from the west side of the bay ; anAmerican having commenced boring with an apparatus proper for thepurpose.There is no danger in entering this excellent harbour : afterrounding the point which has a signal station on it, you will openFalse Bay : this must be passed, as the true bay is romid InnerPoint. That point ought not to be hugged closely, for there are somerocks to the distance of a cable's length, and the wind baffles off itaa 2QG8API'KXDIX.After rounding Inner Point you may anchor where convenient, inquiet still water, with from four to seven fathoms, over a muddy bottom.The landing place is at the mole about the centre of the town.N. 41°. W., nine leagues and a half from the town of Payta, isPoint Paeina, a bluff, about eighty feet high, with a reef to thedistance of half a mile on its west side ; between this point andPayta the coast is low and sandy, with table land of a moderateheight, a short distance from the beach ; and the mountain of Ama-tapefive leagues in the interior.After rounding Point Farina (which is the western extreme ofSouth America), the coast trends abruptly to the northward, andbecomes higher and more chiij^ until you reach Point Sahara. Thisis a double point, the southern part of which is cliffy ; about eightyfeet high, with a small black rock lying off it ; the northern part ismuch lower, and has few breakers near. On the north side of thispoint is a shallow bay, in the depth of which the high cliffy coastagain commences, and runs in a line towards Cape Blanc.Cape Blanc is high and bold (apparently the corner of a longrange of table-land), sloping gradually toward the sea ; near theextreme of the cape there aie two shaq> topped hillocks.; and midwaybetween them and the commencement of the table land, is anotherrise with a sharp top. There are some rocks that shew themselvesabout a quarter of a mile off, but no danger exists without that distance.From Cape Blanc the general trend of the coast is moreeasterly, in nearly a direct hne to Point Malpelo, which is twenty-oneleagues distant.N. 34° E., seven leagues and a half from the former is PointSal, a brown cliff", one hundred and twenty feet high ; along thecoast is a sandy beach, with high cliff as far as the valley of Manor,where it is low with brush wood near the sea ; the hills being at a distanceinland.Northward of Point Sal the coast is cliffy, to about midwaybetween It and Point Picos ; it then becomes lower, and similar toManor.Point Picos is a sloping bluff, with a sandy beach outside it, andanother point, exactly similar, a little to the northward : at the backof it is a cluster of hills with sharp peaks, hence arises, probably,the name given by the Spaniards to this point. From Point Picosthe coast is a sandy beach, with a mixture of hill and cliff of aAPPENDIX. 269light brown colour and well wooded. There are several small baysbetween it and Point Malpelo, which bears N. 41° E., seven and ahalf leagues distant.Point Malpelo, the southern point of the entrance of GuayaquilRiver, may be readily known by the marked difference between itand the coast to the southward : it is very low and covered withbushes to its extreme ; a short distance in-shore, is a clump of busheshigher and more conspicuous than the rest, which shews plainly onapproaching. At the extremity of the point is the River Tumbesoff which a reef extends, to the distance of a quarter offa mile.This place is much frequented by whalers, for fresh water, which isfound about a mile from the entrance, where they fill their boats fromalongside ; great care is necessary in crossing the bar, as a heavyand dangerous* surf beats on it, rendering it at all times difficult tocross. 1The entrance to the river may be distinguished by a hut on theport hand going in, which is perceived immediately you round thepoint. About two leagues up the river stood the old town ofTumbes, now scarcely more thai a few huts, barely sufficient tosupply the whalers with fruit and vegetables. This is the boundaryline, between Peru and the State of the Equator. You may anchorany where off the point in six or seven fathoms.Winds.The prevailing winds on the coast of Peru blow from S.S.E. toS.W. ; seldom stronger than a fresh breeze, and often in particularparts scarcely sufficient to enable shipping to make their passagesfrom one port to another. This is especially the case on the southand south-western coast, between Cobija and Callao.Sometimes during the summer, for three or four successive days,there is not a breath of vend ; the sky is beautifully clear, with anearly vertical sun.On the days that the sea-breeze sets in, it generally commencesabout ten in the morning ; then light and variable, but graduallyincreasing till one or two in the afternoon. From that time, a steadybreeze prevails till near sunset, when it begins to die away ; andsoon after the sun is down there is a calm. About eight or nine270 APPENDIX.in the evening light winds come off the land, and continue till sunrise;when it again becomes calm until the sea-breeze sets in asbefore.During winter (from April to August) light northerly winds maybefrequently expected, accompanied by thick fogs, or dark loweringweather ; but this seldom occurs in the summer months, althougheven then the tops of hiUs are frequently enveloped in mist.To the northward of Callao, the winds are more to be dependedon ; the sea-breeze sets in with greater regularity, and fresher thanon the southern parts ; and near the limit of the Peruvian territory(about Payta and off Cape Blanc), a double-reefed topsail breeze isnot uncommon.It is to be remarked, and may be laid doria as a general rule, thatalthough such moderate winds blow on the coast of Peru, yet suddenand heavy gusts come over high land after the sea-breeze sets in,which, from the smallness of the ports, may be attended with someinconvenience, if precautions are not taken in shortening sail previousto entering them.The only difference between winter and summer, as far as regardsthe winds, is the frequency of light northerly airs during the formermonths ; but in the state of the weather, the difference is far greaterthan one would imagine in so low a latitude. In the summer theweather is delightfully line, with the thermometer (Fahrenheit's)seldom below 70°, and often as high as 80°, in a vessel's cabin ; butduring winter the air is raw and damp, with thick fogs and a cloudyovercast sky. Cloth clothing is then necessary for the security ofhealth ; whereas in summer the lighter you are clad, the more conduciveto comfort and health.The general set of the Current on the coast of Peru is along theshore to the northward, from half a knot to one knot an hour ; butoccasionally it sets to the southward, with equal or even greaterstrength.The period at which these southerly sets take place cannot be ascertainedwith any degree of certainty. Neither seasons, the state ofthe moon, nor other causes common on almost every coast, seem tohave an influence here. The oldest navigators, and men accustomedto the coasting trade, can assign no reason for these changes —they only know that they do take place, and endeavour to profit bythem accordingly.Appendix. 271During our stay on the coast, we frequently experienced thesesoutherly sets, immediately preceding and during northerly winds ;but as this was not always the case, no general rule can be laiddouTi, although it certainly appears a natural inference to draw. "Wealso remarked, that at times the current was setting to the southward,when a fresh wind was, and for days previous, had been blowingfrom that quarter. And as no inequalities or irregularities inthe coast Hne could have occasioned this, it only served to heightenour curiosity, without affording any clue to discover how the peculiaritywas caused.On Passages.With regard to making passages on this coast — little difficulty isfound in going northward ; a fair offing is all that is requisite toensure your making a certain port in a given number of days ; but inworking to windward, some degree of skill, and constant attentionare necessary.Much difference of opinion exists as to whether the inshore oroff-shore route should be preferred ; but from the experience we hadourselves, and from information gained from those who were said tounderstand the coast, we were led to suppose the following the bestline to follow.On leaving Guayaquil or Payta, if bound to CaUao, work close inshoreto about the island of Lobos de Afuera. All agree in this.Endeavour always to be in with the land soon after the sun hasset, that advantage may be taken of the land wind, which beginsabout that time ; this will frequently enable a ship to make her waynearly along shore throughout the night, and place her in a goodsituation for the first of the sea-breeze.After having passed the before-named islands, it would be advisableto work up on their meridian, until you approach the latitude ofCallao ; then stand in, and if it is not fetched, work up along shore,as above directed.Some people have attempted to make this passage, by standingoff for Several days, hoping to fetch in on the other tack, but haveinvariably found it a fruitless effort, owing to the northerly set thatis experienced on approaching the equator.If from Callao and bound to valparaiso, there is no question but272 APPENDIX.that by running off with a full sail the passage will be made in muchless time than by working in-shore, for you run quite through thetrade-wind, and fall in with the westerly winds which are alwaysfound beyond the trades. But for the intermediate ports (exceptingCoquimbo) the case is different, as they lie considerably withinthe trade-wind, and must be worked for by that alone.* It may,however, be recommended to work along shore as before stated, toabout the island of San Gallan. Whence the coast trends more tothe eastward, so that a long leg and a short one may be made (withthe land just in sight) as far as Arica, or to any of the ports betweenPisco and that place.From Arica, the coast being nearly north and south, vesselsbound to the southward should make an offing of about fifteen ortwenty leagues (to ensure keeping the sea-breeze), and work up onthat meridian till in the parallel of the place to which they are bound.On no account is it advisable to make a long stretch off; for as youapproach the limit of the trade-wind it gradually hauls to the eastward,and great difficulty will be found in even fetching the portfrom which you started.The average passage in a well-conditioned merchant-vessel fromGuayaquil to Callao is from fifteen to twenty days ; and from Callaoto Valparaiso about three weeks ; fast-sailing schooners have madethese passages in much less time ; and there is an instance of twomen-of-war, in company, having gone from Callao to Valparaiso,remained there two days, and re-anchored at Callao on the twenty-firstday. But these are rare occurrences, and only to be done undermostfavourable circumstances, such as taking a " norther" soonafter leaving Callao.Neb. These remarks and notices, relating to Peru, are the workof Mr. Usborne. Those referring to Northern Chile are by Lieut.Sulivan. Mr. Stokes and I have added a few words,A dull sailer might do better by running through the trade, makingeasting with westerly winds, and then steering northward' along the coast,than by attempting to work to windward against a trade-wirtfi, whichvaries but a few points.APPENDIX. 273No. 42.Al Snr.

But, by looking through the glass F,and bringing an object into contact with the horizon, which is reallyforty-five degrees above it, the index of the quadrant will be at zero ;and by looking through F, and bringing an object into contact withK, or the horizon, which is really one hundred and thirty-five degreesfrom it, the index of the quadrant will be at ninety degrees.The principle being thus shown, it is unnecessary to go farther inthis place ; either in explaining how it applies equally well to a quin-tantor sextant, or in describing Mr. Worthington's ingenious methodof taking advantage of it, in the sextants he has lately made withpower to measure 160°.In adjusting or verifying the adjustment of the additional glass, Ifound that by measuring the angular distance of two fixed stars morethan forty degrees apart — first carefully by the ordinary method, andthen using the extra or additional glass — it was practicable to ascertainits exact error : the only difficulty I had foreseen in the efficientuse of this auxiliary.I may add, that the telescope moves parallel to the plane of theinstrument, and that there are two sets of numbers referring to onegi-adulation.No. 45.On Clouds.Clouds may be divided into four classes, called —CiERUs, Stratus, Nimbus, Cumulus.Cirrus is the first light cloud that forms in the sky after fine clearweather. It is very Light and delicate in its appearance ; and generallycurling or waving, like feathers, hair, or horses' tails. It mayalso be called the ' Curl Cloud.'Stratus is the shapeless smoke-ike cloud that is most common,and of all sizes : sometimes it is small, and at a distance, like spots ofinky or dirty water ; its edges appearing faint or' ill-defined ; sometimesit rises in fog-banks from water, or land ; sometimes it overspreadsand hides the sky. Rain does not fall from it. Its exact276 APPENDIX.resemblance cannot be traced upon paper, because the edges are soill-defined. It may also be called the ' Flat Cloud.'Nimbus is the heavy-looking, soft, shapeless cloud, from whichrain is falling. Whatever shape a cloud may have retained previousto rain falling from it — at the moment of its change from vapour towater, it softens in appearance, and becomes the ' Nimbus,' orRain Cloud.'Cumulus is the hard-edged cloud, or cloud with well-definededges ; whose resemblance can be accurately traced on paper. Thiscloud is not, generally speaking, so large as the Stratus or Nimbus,aud appears to be a compact mass of either the former or latter, orof both. It may also be called the ' Heap Cloud.'These four classifications of clouds will not, however, suffice todescribe exactly the appearance of the sky at all times. More minutedistinctions are required, for which the following may be used : —Cirro-stratus — signifying a mixture of Cirrus and Stratus.Cirro-cumulus- — Cirrus and Cumulus.Cumulo-stratus — signifying a mixture of Cumulus and Stratus.Which terms may be rendered more explanatory of the precisekind of cloud, by using the augmentative termination onus, or thediminutive, its. Thus: — Citrons, Cirritus ; C irrono- stratus ;Cirrito-stratus ; Carron-cumulus, Cirrito- cumulus ; Stratonus, Straits; Cumulonus, Cumulitus ; Cumulono-stratus, Cumulito-stratus.Should these be found insufficient to convey distinct ideas of everyvariety of clouds, the second word may be augmented or diminished,thus : Cirrono-stratitus, &c.These terms may be abbreviated for common use by Writing onlythe first letters of each word ; allowing one letter to represent thediminutive, two letters the ordinary, or middle degree, and threeletters the augmentative. As Cirrus and Cumulus begin with thesame letter, it will be necessary to make a distinction between themby taking two, three, and four letters, respectively, of Cumulus ;thus, C, Ci., Cir. ; S., St., Str. ; N., Ni, Nim. : Cu., Cum., Cum.Suppose it were desired to express Cumulito-stratoni, C.-Str. wouldbe sufficient, &c.c sua IK o zmra .cmamJiTiD's.C HH ]R O ly d - S IT Jai.!ir TITS -TtFUzKcyCimtianc'O-S'irmA'anrTS *PutlisheilyHanry Callum, 13.

I have neitherability, nor at present space, to make more than a few brief remarkson this subject.Are not storms exceptions to the general winds, or, atmosphericcurrents ; not the causes of them ? * Variable winds are almost continual,except during short intervals of calm ; but hurricanes, oreven ordinary storms, are rare. May not opposing or passing currentscause eddies, or whirls, on an immense scale in the air, notonly horizontal, but inclined to the horizon, or vertical ?In laying a ship to, during a storm, there are other points to considerbesides the veering of the wind ; such as the direction of thesea, with or against a current, &c. I cannot agree with ColonelReid, in his remarks (page 425) about the " problem to be solved,"or in his " Rule for laying ships to in hurricanes."I never myself witnessed a storm that blew from more than fifteenpoints of the compass, either successively, or by sudden changes.In most, if not all of the storms to which 1 can bear any testimony,currents of air arriving from different directions appeared tosucceed each other, or combine together. One usually brought ' thedirt,' to use a sailor's phrase, and another cleared it away, afterdriving much of it back again, often Math redoubled fury. One ofthese currents was warm and moist — another cold and dry, comparativelyspeaking. While one lasted, the barometer feU, or was stationary; with another it rose. At ■ all places I have visited, or ofwhich I have obtained notices on the subject, the barometer standshigh with easterly, and comparatively low with westerly winds, onan average. Northerly winds in the northern hemisphere affect thebarometer, like southerly winds in the southern hemisphere.No. 47.Tides.At the end of the year 1833, I received from Mr. Whewell a copyof a work for which seamen in general are deeply indebted to him. ItReid's Law of Storms, p, 120, &c.278 APPENDIX.bore the unpretending title of an " Essay towards a first approximationto a Map of Comical Lines;" but however Lightly the authormight esteem it, there can be no doubt that it tended to remove acloud which hung over numerous difficulties ; and to enable us notonly to take a general view of them, but to see how we should directour course in order to attain some knowledge of their intricacies.In 1831 Mr. Lubbock called the attention of mathematicians, aswell as of practical seamen, to the subject of Tides : but it was Mr.Wheel who aroused general interest ; and, assisted by the Admiralty,engaged the co-operation of observers in all quarters of theglobe.At the first perusal of Mr. Whewell's essay, I was particularlystruck by the following passages : " But in the meantime no oneappears to have attempted to trace the nature of the connexionamong the tides of the different parts of the world. We are, perhaps,not even yet able to answer decisively the inquiry whichBacon suggests to the philosophers of his time, whether the highwater extends across the Atlantic so as to affect, contemporaneously,the shores of America and Africa ? or, whether it is high on one sideof this ocean when it is low on the other .' at any rate, such observationshave not' been extended and generalized." * Also : fIf the time of high water at Plymouth be five, and at the Eddystoneeight (as formerly stated), the water must be falling for threehours on the shore, while it is rising at the same time at ten ortwelve miles distance ; and this through a height of several feet. Wecan hardly imagine that any elevation in one of the situations, shouldnot be transferred to the other in a much shorter time than this.There is, in fact, no doubt that most, or all the statements of suchdiscrepancies, are founded in a mistake arising from the comparisonof two different phenomena ; namely, the time of high water, andthe time of the change from the flow to the ebb current. In somecases the one, and in some the other of these times, has beenobserved as the time of the hide ; and in this manner have arisensuch anomalies as have been mentioned." And again : IThe persuasion that, in waters affected by tides, the water riseswhile it runs one way, and falls while it runs the opposite way, thoughwholly erroneous, is very general."These, and other valuable remarks, showed me what indistinct orerroneous ideas I had entertained ; and that many other seamen had"-^ Philosophical Transactions, 1833, p. 148. t Ibid. 157. I Ibid.APPENDIX. 279been siinilarl}^ perplexed, I could have little doubt, having oftentalked to experienced practical men on the subject. Probably theexpressions ' tide and half-tide,' ' tide and quarter-tide,' &c., conveyedmore distinct ideas to their minds, than to mine : for to methey were unsatisfactory, and although quite aware of their meaning,I never liked them. From 1833, I and my companions on boardthe Beagle paid more attention to the subject, and made observationsin the manner suggested by Mr. Whewell, as often as ourother avocations allowed. It was, however, impossible to take interestin the subject, and discover difficulties, facts irreconcilable to theory,without trying to think how to account for them — unqualified evenas I knew myself to be for such a task.* Perhaps I was encouragedto meditate by Mr. Whewell's concluding paragraph ; f and, separatedfrom assistance, I tried to reason my way out of the dilemma,by the help of such few data as I could dwell upon pith certaintyAmong the points which I could not establish in my own mind, byappeal to facts, were — " the tides of the Atlantic are, at least in theirmain features, of a derivative kind, and are propagated from south tonorth." (p. 164.) "That the tide. wave travels from the Cape of GoodHope to the bottom of the Gulf of Guinea, in something less than fourhours." (p. 167.) " That the tide-wave travels along this coast (American)from north to south, employing about twelve hours in its motion fromAcapulco to the Strait of Magalhaens." (p. 194.) " From the comparativenarrowness of the passage to the north (of Australia), it is almostcertain that these tides must come from the southern side of the continent."(p. 200.) " The derivative tide which enters such oceans (Northand South Pacific) from the south-east, is diffused over so wide a space,that its amount is also greatly reduced." (p. 217.) &c.t " I cannot conclude this memoir without again expressing my entireconviction of its very imperfect character. I should regret its publication,if I supposed it likely that any intelligent person could consider it otherwisethan as an attempt to combine such information as we have, and topoint out the want and the use of more. I shall neither be surprised normortified, if the lines which I have drawn shall turn out to be, in many instances,widely erroneous : I offer them only as the simplest mode whichI can now discover of grouping the facts which we possess. The lineswhich occupy the Atlantic, and those which are near the coasts of Europe,appear to have the greatest degree of probability. The tides on thecoasts of New Zealand and New Holland, have also a consistency whichmakes them very probable. The Indian Ocean is less certain ; thoughit is not easy to see how the course of the lines can be very widely different280 Appendix.Some of the facts which seem to stand most in opposition to thetheory that deduces tides in the northern Atlantic from the movementof a tide-wave originated in the great southern ocean are :• — the comparative narrowness of the space between Africa and America; with the certainty that the sea is neither uniformly nor excessivelydeep in that space,* and the trifling rise of tide ; not onlyupon either nearest shore (where it does not exceed four or five feetat the utmost), but at Ascension Island, where the highest rise is nottwo feet.f Secondly, the absence of any regular tide about the wideestuary of the river Plata, the situation and shape of which seems sowell disposed for receiving an immense tides Thirdly, the flood-tidemoving towards the west and south along the coast of Brazil,rent from that which we have taken. The course of these lines in thePacific appears to be altogether problematical ; and though those whichare drawn in the neighbourhood of the west coast of America connectmost of the best observations, they can hardly be considered as more thanconjecture : in the middle of the Pacific I have not even ventured to conjecture.Tt only remains to add, that 1 shall be most glad to profit byevery opportunity of improving this map, and will endeavour to employfor this pui-pose any information with which I may be supplied." —pp. 234-5.• Besides the ' Roccas', Fernando de Noronha, and St. Paul rocks,various accounts have been received, from time to time, of shoals near theequator, between the meridians of fifteen and twenty four degrees west.There can be no doubt, from the descriptions, that many alarms have beencaused in that neighbourhood by earthquakes; which are, to my apprehension,indications of no very great depth of water. In 1761, a smallsandy island was said to have been seen by Captain Bouvet, of Le Vaillant.This, if seen, has probably sunk down since. Krusenstern saw avolcanic eruption thereabouts in 1806. In 1816, Captain Proudfoot, inthe ship Triton, from Calcutta to Gibraltar, passed over a bank, in latitude0° 32' S. and longitude 17" 46' \V. It appeared to extend in an eastand west direction three miles, and in a north and south direction onemile. They sounded in twenty-three fathoms, brown sand ; but saw noappearance of breakers.t At St. Helena it is not three feet : while at Tristan d'Acunha thereis a rise of eight or nine feet under ordinary circumstances.{ I have passed months in that river without being able to detect anyperiodical rise of water, which I could attribute to tide ; though it is said,that when the weather is very settled, some indications of a tide may beperceived.appendix. 281from near Pernambuco to the vicinity of the river Plata ; and lastlythe almost uniformity of the time of high \A'ater along that extent of-the coast of Africa which reaches from near the Cape of Good Hopeto the neighbourhood of the Congo.Against the supposition that a tide-wave travels along the westcoast of America, from north to south, are the facts — that the flood-tideimpinges upon Chiloe and the adjacent outer coast, from thesouthward of west ; that it is high water at Cape Pillar and at Chiloe,including the intermediate coast, almost at one time ; * that fromValdivia to the Bay of Mexillones (differing eighteen degrees in latitude),there is not an hour's difference in the time of high water ;that from Arica to Payta the times vary gradually as the coasttrends westward ; that from Panama to California, the times alsochange gradually as the coast trends westward ; and that from fortyto sixty north, high water takes place at one time.Having thus stated a few of the difficulties to be encountered by atheory which supposes such important tide-waves to move in the directionof a meridian, rather than in that of a parallel, I will ventureto bring forward the results of much anxious meditation on thesubject, trusting that they will be received by the reader — not asassertions — not as conclusions to which assent is asked without areason for acquiescence being given — but as the veiy^ fallible opinionof one individual, who is anxious to contribute a mite, however small,towards the information of those for whom this work is more particularlybitten — namely, seafaring men ; and who, if his ideas arefallacious, will rejoice at their refutation by the voice of truth.Resting in confidence upon the Newtonian theory — which assignsas the primary causes of tides the attractions of the moon and sun —I win make a few remarks, and then state some facts from whichto reason.Some persons seem to view the tidal phenomena more in connectionwith what would have happened had the globe been coveredwith water, than with reference to what actually happens, nowthat the oceans are nearly separated by tracts of land. They appear toconsider that the effects of the moon's attraction (leaving the sun's outof the question at present, as it is similar though smaller) are feltonly in vertical hues ; and they do not allow for the lateral action ofWithin about half an hour; an irregularity easily accounted for, andto which any one place is subject.bb282 APPENDIX.the moon upon a body of water, by which any portion is attractedtowards her before she is vertically over it, as well as after she haspassed to the westward of the meridian of that portion.But little attention appears to have been paid to a considerationof the momentum acquired by any great body of water moved fromthe position it Mould occupy if undisturbed, and to the consequencesof that momentum, when the water returns from a temporary displacement.And there seems to be a difficulty in altogether reconciling thestatement that " tides are diminished by diffusion,* with the mannerin which the great tides of the Northern Atlantic are supposed tobe caused — a supposition which is mainly dependent upon theprincipleof " forced vibrations or oscillations. "fIn consequence of similar ideas, excited by the facts previouslymentioned, the following questions were inserted in the GeographicalJournal for 1836 : —It may appear presumption in a plain sailor attempting to offeran idea or two on the difficult subject of ' Tides ;' yet, with theutmost deference to those who are competent to reason upon thesubject, I will venture to ask whether the supposition of Atlantictides being principally caused by a great tide-wave coming from theSouthern Ocean, is not a little difficult to reconcile with the facts thatthere is very little tide upon the coasts of Brazil, Ascension, andGuinea, and that in the mouth of the great river Plata there is littleor no tide .'Can each ocean have its own tides, though affecting, and beingaffected by the neighbouring waters ?Can the mass of an ocean have a tendency to move westward aswell as upward, after and towards the moon as she passes ? If so,after the moon has passed, will not the mass of that ocean have aneasterly inclination to regain that equilibrium (with respect to theearth alone) from which the moon disturbed it (sun's action nothere considered) ?In regaining its equilibrium, would not its owa momentum carryit too far eastward ; and would not the moon's action be againapproaching ?Can one part of an ocean have a Westward tendency, while anotherpart, which is wider or narrower, from east to west, has an eastward• Whewell's Essay, p. 217.+ Herschel's Astronomy, Cab.

R. Geog. Soc. vol. vi. part II.p. 336.)It might have been concluded that these questions had scarcely-beennoticed, as I heard nothing on the subject, had I not lately readthe following remarks in a work published in 1837. Whether theirauthor ever saw the questions, I do not know ; but as his observationsbear strongly upon the subject, and are those of an eminent mathematician,I quote them verbatim :—Suppose several high, narrow strips of land were now to encirclethe globe, passing through the opposite poles, and dividing theearth's surface into several great, unequal oceans ; a separate tidewould be raised in each. When the tidal wave had reached the farthestshore of one of them, conceive the causes that produced it tocease ; then the wave thus raised would recede to the oppositeshore, and continue to oscillate until destroyed by the friction of itsbed. But if instead of ceasing to act, the causes which producedthe tide were to re-appear at the opposite shore of the ocean, at thevery moment when the reflected tide had returned to the place of itsorigin, then the second tide would act in augmentation of the first ;and if this continued, tides of great height might be produced forages.The result might be, that the narrow ridge dividing the adjacentoceans would be broken through, and the tidal wave traverse abroader tract than in the former ocean. Let us imagine the newocean to be just so much broader than the old, that the reflected tidewould return to the origin of the tidal movement half a tide laterthan before ; then instead of those two super-imposed tides, we shouldhave a tide arising from the subtraction of one from the other. Thealterations of the height of the tides on shores so circumstanced mightbe very small, and this might again continue for ages, thus causingbeaches to be raised at very different elevations, without any realalteration in the level, either of the sea or land." — (Babbage's NinthBridgewater Treatise, pp. 248, 249.)Additional data, and leisure to reflect upon them, have tended toconfirm the view taken previously to asking those questions in theGeographical Journal ; but before stating this view more explicitly,it is necessary to lay facts before my readers, from which they mayjudge for themselves.bb2APPENDIX.In the greatest expanse of ocean, that which meets with only partialinterruption to free tidal movements — the zone, if it maj"- be socalled, near fifty-five degrees of south latitude — there Is high water atopposite sides, and low water at opposite sides of the globe nearlyat the same time.At the eastern part of the Falkland Islands, exposed to the tide ofthis zone, it is high water, or full sea, at about nine o'clock on theday of new, or full moon, by Greenwich time ;* and on the southernshore of Van Diemen's Land it is high-water at about ten. This isnot a point exactly opposite, it is true, but it is the nearest so atwhich we have yet observed.At each of these places the tide rises six hours and falls six hours,alternately ; therefore when it is low water at one, it is also low waterat the other. There is no intermediate place in this zone, ratherdistant from these points, at which I know of a tide observationdeserving confidence ; but those above-mentioned are certain, andcorroborate the Newtonian theory in a satisfactory manner.This is, however, the only zone of ocean, which is at all able tofollow the law which would govern its undulations if the globe werecovered with water. In other zones (taking about ten degreesin latitude as a zone) it is high water, generally speaking, at oneside of an ocean near the time that it is low on the other.In oceans about ninety degrees wide, this happens very nearly ;but as the width diminishes, so do the times of high water at eachside approach ; and as the viidth increases beyond ninety' degrees, asin the case of zones of the Pacific, the times of high water stillapproach (in consequence of the tendency to high Mater at oppositepoints), and farther confirm the Newtonian theory.For examples (on the day of full moon) : — In the Pacific, at PortHenry, in 50° S. it is high water at 5h. at M'hich time it is near lowwater at Auckland Island, where the time of high tide is 12h. 30m.In this case, the interval between one high water, and the other onthe opposite side of the ocean, is 7h. 30m. or 4.30 ; and the ^vidth ofthat ocean is nearly eight hours (measured in time.)At Valdivia, in lat. 4C° S. it is high water at 3h. 30m. and at NewZealand, on that parallel, at 9h. 50m. The space of ocean betweenis seven hours nearly : the differences are 6.20 and 5.40.Towhicli all the tinips are here reduced for easy comparison.APPENDIX. 285In 30° S. at Coquimbo, it is high water at '2h. and at NorfolkIsland it is high at about 9h. The intermediate space of ocean isnearly eight hours wide.*In 20° S., at Iquique, it is high water at Ih. 30m., and at NewCaledonia, in the same parallel, it is high water at Sh. hom. Thespace between is about eight hours wide : the least difference 4.15.Near 10°, or 12°, at Callao, it is high water at about ten ; butas on this parallel a multitude of islands spread across half thePacific, no comparison of times can be trusted.On the equator — at the Galapagos Islands — it is high water at8h. 20m. ; and at New Ireland it is high water at 3h. 00m. — a differenceof seven hours nearly. The ocean is here eight hours ^\^[de ;but at New Ireland there is only one tide m tM'ent}'-four hours — ananomaly to be considered presently.The parallel of 10° N. is similar to that of the equator — however,we may as well examine it. At the little Isle of Cocos, and at Nicolsonthe main, it is high water at aljout si. ; and at the PhilippineIslands, in the same latitude, at 4h. ; the difference, eight hours, ianot far from the meridian distance, which is about ten hours ; but thePhilippines also feel the effects of cases which influence the tidesat New Ireland, and, generally, those of the Indian Archipelago.In 20° N. at San Bias, it is high water at 3h ; and at Loo-chop,the nearest knows point of comparison at the other sic? o the ocean,at lOh. The difference, 7 hours, is about an hour less than themeridian distance. In 30° N. on the Coast of California, it is highwater at 4h., and at Nangasaky, in Japan, in lat. 32° 44', at 11.12.The difference, 7.12, is nearly half an hour less than the meridiandistance. In 40° N. it is high water at about 8h. on the Americancoast, but for the opposite shore I have no data. In 50° N. it is highwater on Vancouver Island at 9h., and at the south extreme of Kamait is said to be high water at about 6h. ; the difference, 9 or3 hours, is anomalous — made so probably by a derivative tide.Having examined the Pacific, let us proceed in a similar mannerwith the Atlantic, and the Indian Ocean : —In 40° S. off Blanc Bay, the time of high water is 9h. ; thesame as at the Falklands.At Amsterdam Island, one authority says 6h., another I2h, for theA derivative tide (p. 28'J) may act here.APPENDIX.time of high water. Both cannot be right : but thinking the lattercorrect, I have preferred it. In Bass Strait it is high water at aboutten. Between the two extremes there are thirteen hours, and betweenthe times of tide there are eleven, or thirteen hours. At AmsterdamIsland, high water is taken as two hours after that of Bass Strait,but the difference of meridians is about four hours. The differencebetween the high water of Amsterdam, and Blanc Bay, is nine hours,and their difference of meridians is about nine hours.In 30° S. it is high water on the African coast at two, and on theAmerican coast at six. There are about four hours difference ofmeridian between them in that parallel.In 20° S. it is high water at 3h. on the African shore, and 6h. onthe Brazilian ; the meridian distance is about three hours and threequarters.In 10° S. at 3h. 15m. on the east side and 7h. on the west: thedistance is about three hours and a quarter.On the equator we have 4h. 30m. at the eastern limit, and nearly8h. at the western ; the distance being about three hours and a half.In 10° N. 7h. and lOh. the distance being three hours.In 20° N. at Cape Blanc, at about Ih. ; and on the north coastof San Domingo, nearly at 11 h. The interval is about 3.40 : butthere are interfering derivative tides, probably, as well as local peculiarities,among the West-india Islands.In 30° N. about 4h. on the east and Ih. 30m. on the west. Thedistance is nearly five hours. This seems anomalous.In 40° N. 3h. on the coast of Spain, and at about Ih. on the coastof America. This is another anomaly : but easy of explanation.In 50° N. it is high water at 4h. 36m., in the mouth of the channel; and at lOh. 45m. on the coast of Newfoundland. Their meridiandistance is about 3.20.On the west coasts of Ireland and Scotland, from 5h. to 6h. is thehour of high water ; on the coast of Labrador, it is from lOh. tollh., in the same parallels. The meridian distances are from threeto four hours : but as we approach the parallel of 60° N. the NorthSea and Davis Strait open, which probably affect the tide betweenIreland and Labrador.The Indian Ocean appears to have high water on all sides at once,though not in the central parts at the same time. Thus, it is highwater at the north-west extremity of Australia ; on the coast of^ .-O"^"Diiahfid oy Hezay Ccuijuro.].'^ Great Maxtbororu^ Sores 1339.APPENDIX. 287Java ; on that of Sumatra ; at Ceylon ; at the Laccadiva Islands ;at the Seychelles ; on the coast of Madagascar ; and at AmsterdamIsland, at twelve : but at the Chaos Islands and Mauritius it ishigh water at about nine, and at the Keeling Isles about eleven.Here, then, it would seem that there is cause for much perplexity.Having now stated the principal facts which occur to my mind, Iwill mention the conclusions drawn from them, and then attempt toexplain the anomalies.Let E G (fig. 1.) represent a section of our globe, of which A BC D is supposed to be land, and E F G H water. Let H M showthe direction in which the moon's attraction would operate. Theeffect of her attraction, according to Newton's demonstration, wouldbe to raise the water at F by positive attraction of the water, and atH by attracting the earth more than the water : — let the dotted linerepresent the consequent figure of the ocean.In fig. 2, let the ocean be supposed 90° or six hours wide ; let themoon act in the direction M F ; and let the dotted line represent thealtered position of the water when moved out of its natural position(with respect to the earth) by the moon's attraction.Again, in fig. 3, suppose the moon acting in the line M K, andthe dotted line representing the figure taken in that case by theocean.It will occur to the reader that but little water can rise at Fand H (fig. 1), at F (fig. 2), or at K (fig. 3), unless water falls orsinks, at E and G (fig. 1), G (fig. 2), F and G (fig. 3). becausewater is but slightly compressible, except under extraordinary pressure,and because it is incapable of being stretched ; therefore, if at anyplace the sea is raised above its natural level, the excess must besupplied by a sinking taking place elsewhere. There cannot be avoid space left under the sea between the water and its bed ; andthere is no lateral movement of the particles at the surface onlyof the ocean sufficient to cause high tides on either shore : —therefore the conclusion may be drawTi, that the whole mass libratesor oscillates.By liberating I mean such a movement as that which a large jellywould have, if its upper part were pushed on one side,, and thenall-wed to vibrate while the base remained fixed : and by oscillatingI mean a movement like that of water in a basin, after the basin isgently tilted and let down again : and that such a motion would be288 APl'ENDIX.imperceptible, except by its effects, there can be little doubt afterreflecting how small a lateral movement of an ocean would causeimmense commotion at its boundary, in consequence of the slightelasticity of water, when free to move.Now let the moon be supposed to move from M in fig. 2 to M infig. 3. The highest point of the water would then be transferredfrom F to K, during which transfer the water must fall at F andrise at G : and so of other points. In this manner when the mooncauses a tide by her direct attraction, a wave or swelling, whosecrest is above the natural level of the sea, moves westward, untilit is stopped by a barrier of land. But when it recedes from thatbarrier, how is the excess of the wave above the height of the sea(when uninfluenced by the moon) transferred to the other side ofthe same ocean ? There is no return wave : if there were, islandsintermediate would have an ebb, and a flood tide, every six hours ;four floods in twenty-four hours ; but they have, on the contrary,six hour tides, alternate ebb and flow, twice in twenty-four hours,like those of the shores of continents, though generally smaller inamount. Water cannot rise in one place unless it falls in another■^it does fall on one side of an ocean, while it rises on the otherhow then is the fluid transferred .'' There is only one way —which is by the mass oscillating. In the former case when themoon passed over, it was a vibratory movement, in this latter it is anoscillation.If it is shoving, as I believe, that the ocean oscillates, we see thatthere are two principal causes of tides — one the direct raising ofwater by the moon : and the other, oscillation excited by that temporaryderangement of the natural level of the sea.From the preceding facts and deductions combined with the commonlyreceived laws of fluids and gravitation, the following conclusionsmay be drawn : —1 . Every large body of water is affected by the attraction of themoon, and sun, and has tides caused by their action.2. Bodies of water are not only raised, or accumulated, vertically,by the attraction of the moon and sun ; but they are also drawnlaterally by them.3. When a large body of water is prevented from continuing ahorizontal movement, it rises until whatever momentum it hadacquired ceases ; and then it sinks gradually.APPENDIX. 2894. The momentum acquired by a body of water in thus sinkingback to the position it should occupy, with reference to the earth'sattraction only, carries it beyond that position to one from which ithas a tendency to recoil again — and so to keep up an oscillationuntil brought to rest by the friction of its bed. (Attraction of themoon and sun not considered.)5. The recurring influences of the moon and sun are checks onthese oscillations, and prevent their taking place more than oncebetween each separate raising of the water in consequence of theirattractions.6. Different zones (or widths measured by latitude) of an ocean,may move differently, each having waves and oscillations at timesdiffering from those of an adjoining zone, in consequence of onehaving more or less longitude, depth, or freedom from obstacles thananother.7. Original waves and oscillations combine with, and modify oneanother, according to their relative magnitude, momentum, anddirection.8. The natural tendency of tide-waves, and oceanic vibrations, isfrom east to west ; and of oscillations, from west to east, and eastto west also : but derivative waves or oscillations move in variousdirections according to primary impulse, and local configuration ofthe bed of rn ocean.Conformably to these conclusions, I will now try to explain a fewof the more remarkable anomalies of tides, in various parts of theworld : taking it for granted that the reader is acquainted vfithexisting works on the subject, especially those of Mr. Whewell,*and the brief but comprehensive and explanatory view taken by SirJ. Herschel in his treatise on astronomy. •}■I mentioned that between Callao and the western shores of thePacific, in the parallel of about 12° south, no comparison of timescan be trusted ? Why not ? may be asked. Four or five hours westof Callao, there is a multitude of islands which checks the liberation ofthe ocean. Another tide wave forms westward of them, on a smallscale, and it is by this second tide, altered by derivative tidesPublished in the Philosophical Transactions.+ Cabinet Encyclopaedia. A Treatise on Astronomy, chap, xi., pp. 334,5, 6, 7, 8, 9.290 APPENDIX.from each side, that the western portion of this zone is affected.Otaheite is thus at the edge, or Unit, of four tides — one east, anotherwest, a third to the north, and a fourth to the south, and asthese tides are moving with different impulses, and at differenttimes, it is not at all surprising that they should almost neutralizeeach other at Otaheite. As we go west or east of that island, wefind the tides augmenting gradually in height. At the FriendlyIslands they rise five feet, and at the Gambier Islands three feet.Respecting the twelve hour tide at New Ireland, and at otherplaces in the Indian archipelago — appeal to facts, so far as we cantrace the tides at present, tends to confirm the explanation of SirIsaac Newton, which consisted in supposing that such tides are compoundedof two tides, which arrive by different paths, one six hourslater than the other. " When the moon is in the equator, themorning and evening tides of each component tide arc equal, andthe tides obliterate each other by interference, which takes placeabout the equinoxes. At other periods the higher tides of each componentdaily pair, are compounded into a tide which takes place atthe intermediate time, that is, once a day ; and this time will beafter noon or before, according to the time of year." — Whewell, inPhil. Trans. 1833, p. 224.At New Ireland, the time of high water is about 3 ; but at NewCaledonia it is 9. Again, at the north-west coast of Australia, it is12 ; and at the eastern approach to Torres Strait, 10 : at the PhilippineIslands it is 4 ; and at Loo Chop, 10. Now here are varioustimes of tide, and different impulses, crowded together into a comparativelysmall space, sufficient to perplex any theorist of the presentday. Owing to local configurations, and a variety of incidentalcircumstances, we find every kind of tide in this region, inaspace sixty degrees square. Although tidal impulses, waves,and resulting currents are checked and altered by the broken landof the Indian archipelago, they cannot be suddenly destroyed, orprevented from influencing each other, while communications, moreor less open, exist in so many directions.At the Sandwich Islands there is said to be very little tide. As itis high water in 40° N., on the American coast, at 8 ; at which timeit is also high water at the Galapagos, it appears that the twozones of the ocean — one about the equator, and the other near 40° N.have high water, in the meridian of the Sandwich Islands, at twoAPPENDIX. 291very different times ; and that the high water of the northern zonewill have passed that meridian about three hours before the equatorialwave. Impulses derived from them might succeed oneanother at an intermediate point, such as the Sandwich Islands.Besides which, there is the tide of their own zone to be considered ;in consequence of which alone it might be high water at about 6 :thus these islands are so situated as to receive at least three tides —one primary and two derivative — whose respective times of high waterare 1, 6, and 10, a succession which may well be supposed to neutraliseany ebb, and maintain the water thereabout above its naturallevel, independent of tide.About the Strait of Magalhaens, and along the eastern coast ofPatagonia, there are very high tides ; apparently complicated, butperhaps less so than is usually believed.A powerful tide arrives at the Falklands, and at the east end ofStaten Land, at about 9 ; which is opposed by another powerfultide arriving from the west. The union of these two accumulatesthe water between Tierra del Fuego and the Gallants, and on theeast coast of Patagonia.Within the Strait of Magalhaens, westward of the Second Narrow,it is high water at about 4.40, and the tide rises six feet :but eastward of the First Narrow it is high at 1.30, and the tide risesforty feet.Now, as in one case the sea only rises three feet, and in the othertwenty, above its mean level, every one would expect to find a rushof water through the Narrows, from the high sea to the low, andsuch is the fact. From ten to four the water runs westward withgreat velocity, and from four till ten it rushes eastward. During thefirst interval, from ten to four, the eastern body of water, betweenTierra del Fuego and the Gallants, is above the mean level ; andduring the latter interval, from four till ten, it is below the meanlevel — that which it would have if there were no tides.From 50° S. to near Blanc Bay in 40° S. the tide-wave certainlytravels along the coast to the north ; but this is a derivative from themeeting of tides above-mentioned, combined with the primary tideson the coast traversed. In this way principally may we accountfor a high tide in one place on this coast, and a low one on another(similarly situated, though differing in latitude) ; and, again, a hightide at another place. During the twenty-four hours that the deri-Al'PKNDIX.native wave occupies in moving from Cape Virgins to the Colorado, italternately augments or diminishes two floods and two ebbs of thegreat ocean. Perhaps, indeed, it reaches farther and affects the waterabout the Plata.The extraordinary ' races' about the Peninsula of San Jose, andthe apparent absence of currents about the straight coast extendingeastward from Blanc Bay, may be attributed to conflicting tidal impulses.Why there should be no tide in the River Plata, situated andshaped as it is, seems extraordinary ; but as it is high water at 6h. onthe coast of Brazil, and at Sh. about Blanc Bay; and as a derivativewave from this neighbourhood must move eastward and northward,there is a filling up, from the southward, as an ebbing takes place inconsequenceof a regular six-hour tide ; and vice versa.Tristan d'Acunha has a considerable rise of tide, about eight feet,though Ascension and St. Helena have only about two feet. Theformer place is affected by a great southern tide ; the two latter areinfluenced by the comparatively small tide which traverses the spacebetween Africa and Brazil.In the West Indies there are varieties of tides, caused by primaryand derivative impulses, exceedingly modified by local circumstances :none however are large, while some are as small as those of Ota-lieite — scarcely a foot at the utmost. There are places also in thatarchipelago where there is only one tide in twenty-four hours. Inconsidering the West-india tides, those of the east coast of NorthAmerica, and the exceedingly high ones of Fundy Bay, the gulf streamought not to be overlooked, as it may affect the tides on the coastsit traverses even more than those on the Patagoniann coast are alteredby the current driven along it from near Tierra del Fuego.I may here remark that Mr. Wheel was misled by inaccurate datarespecting several times of high water, of material consequence to hiscomical lines. At the Western Islands he had 1|^ and 2j, where thereought to have been 4}, according to Mendoza Ros' tables, confirmedby the Beagle's observations ; at Madeira he used l^, the time of thestream changing, instead of 4, the time of high water ; at the CapeVerde Islands he took the time of low tide, instead of that of highwater ; his 5h. line is near Ascension, whei'e the time of high wateris 6.20 ; and his 2h. line is close to St. Helena, where the time isabout five. The deficiency of data is so great, owing to mistakingAppendix. 298the turn of stream for the time of high water, and registeringor calculating observations erroneously, that little dependence can beplaced in at least one-third of those hitherto recorded. On thisaccount chiefly, though partly to simplify the question, I have nothoped to be much nearer the mark than half an hour in this discussion,discarding fractions as much as possible, and attemptingonly to avoid errors of material consequence.Looking at the Atlantic, as represented on a globe, we see thatNewfoundland and the adjacent coasts are so placed as to receivetidal impulses from the Arctic Sea, North Atlantic Ocean, thetropical part of the North Atlantic and the gulf stream : besideswhich, no doubt, a derivative from the equatorial zone is felt there.It is high water at the east side of the Atlantic, from theCanary Islands to Scotland, within an hour or two of the same time,on the salient points of the coast, namely, at about 4h. ; and if theopposite coast were straight, like that of Chile, and uninfluenced byderivative tides or by currents, we might expect that it would be highwater there at about 7h., allowing that the tide-wave moved as it isfound to do generally. But it is high water at about Ih., from30° to 40,° the times increasing northward from 40° N. to the Bayof Fundy, and also increasing southward from 50° N. to that bay,where, as every sailor knows, the tides rise higher than in anyother part of the world. This sequence of times, each ending inabout 43° N., the adjacent gulf stream, (an immense river in theocean), and an accumulation of water in that corner higher than isknown any where else, show that we cannot there expect to find datafor tidal miles. In that quarter is evidently a marked exception,caused by the conflux of at least two primary tides, two derivatives,and a powerful current, aided by the peculiar configuration of theland.In the Mediterranean it is supposed by many persons that there isno ebb and flow ; but Captain Smith, who surveyed so much of itsshores, informs me that he found a tide, small certainly and apparentlynot governed by the moon, but regular. I have myself noticeda small rise and fall there ; and the consent, caused by tide, in theFaro of Messina, is well known.As the moon passes over the Indian Ocean, the natural effect ofher attraction must be to accumulate the waters, and draw the waveso caused after her, as in other places ; but while that ocean is obeyedAFPliXDIX.ing her power, and the wave is travelling toward the west, anotherwave is approaching from the Pacific — a wave which has been retardedin its passage— and its crest passes through the Indian archipelago,while the water would otherwise be falling at the western part ofTorres Strait. At the same time, a derivative* wave moving northwardalong the west Australian coast, combines vdth the Pacific waveto raise a high tide about the north-west coast of Australia, where,if it were not for these auxiliaries, there would be low water at thattime. Six hours afterwards, one body has ebbed toward thePacific — the other southward, toward the then comparatively lowocean, south of Australia, and what — if Torres Straits were blockedup ; and the water prevented from falling away toward the south —would be a high tide, is, in fact, low water. The tides in the twonorthern bays are derivatives, and move northward.High water taking place at one time — within an hour — all alongthe east coast of Africa, shows that the rise of sea, or tide-wave,there moves westward or eastward, and the times of high water atthe islands are farther confirmations ; for the wave is at Chaos andat the Mauritius three or four hours before it is high water on theAfrican coast. The KeeUng time shows that there the water riseslonger, in consequence of that part of the ocean being affected bythe advancing swell of the Pacific.The only remaining particular case which I now recollect is thatof the south coast of Australia — from King George Sound to SpencerGulf — a large space of sea, in which there is very little rise of tide —and even that little very irregular.As the high water moves westward from the meridians of thatgreat bay, a tide moves southward from the Indian archipelago,where it is high water just as it should be low in the bay mentioned: hence there is a filling, or flowing, from one wave, while anotheris retreating. In this wide expanse, affected by derivative tidesfrom three adjoining oceans, we cannot but expect irregularities ; eithervery high tides, caused by combination — or little or no tide, in consequenceof mutual destruction — one tide ebbing from, whUe another isflowing toward the same place.Throughout these remarks I have intentionally omitted to saymuch of the sun's action, because, though very inferior, it is simiaDerived from a great southern wave passing westward.APPENDIX. 295lar to that of the moon. Perhaps the Otaheite tide may be purely-solar;this, however, is not at all certain.It appears to me probable, that many important currents are causedby the tidal libration or oscillation of the sea. As the earth turnsonly one way, the moon is continually pulling, as it were, in onedirection, and to this cause, I think, most of the greater currentsmay be traced. Wind, evaporation, and the variable weight of theatmosphere may each have a share in moving the waters horizontally ;but there are many facts which lead to a conclusion that the moonand sun are principal agents in causing currents.*Having alluded to the effect of atmospheric pressure on the ocean,I will take this opportunity of mentioning that the chief cause ofwater rising on the shore before hurricanes, or gales of wind, maybethe lightened pressure on the surface of the sea, indicated by themercury being low in a barometer. This is very remarkable at theMauritius and in the river Plata, at both which places the waterrises unusually before a storm, while at the same time the mercuryfalls. As the column rises, so the water falls again. I have instancedthose places as being well known, and affected very little bytide : but the fact has been observed by me in many places duringthe Beagle's voyage, and I have besides collected the testimony ofothers respecting it.These causes may materially affect the height of tides and thestrength of currents. In the wide but shallow Plata, the depth ofwater and nature of current varies in extraordinary accordance withthe barometer.Another cause of the water rising before a high wind, or storm,as well as of a ground swell, of rollers, or of that disturbed tumultuousheaving of the sea, sometimes observed while there is little orno wind at the place, may be the action of wind on a remote partof that sea ; an action, or pressure, which is rapidly transmitted,through a fluid but slightly elastic, to regions at a distance.I have collected many instances of rollers, or a heavy swell, or aconfused ground swell being felt at places, where not only there wasno wind at the time, but to which the wind that caused the movesA continued stream may be produced by a succession of impulses,as a rotatory system of waves may " be kept in constant circulation byimpulses received from the adjacent tides." — See Whewell in Phil.Trans. 1836, p. 299.296 APPENDIX.ments of water never reached, lliat they were caused by %nnd Iproved by the logs of ships, which were in the respective gales atthe time their effects on the sea were thus felt at a great distance.Tie places to which I particularly allude are the Cape "verde Islands,Ascension, St. Helena, Tristan d'Acunha, Cape Frio, Tierra delFuego, Chiloe, the coast of Chile, the Galapagos Islands, Otaheite,the Seeing Islands, Mauritius, and the Cape of Good Hope.Waves, or rollers, caused by earthquakes, or volcanic eruptions,are, of course, unconnected with wind or atmospheric pressure.But in accounting for currents, as occasioned in some if not manyinstances by tidal pressure, or a succession of tidal impulses, wemust not overlook the well known power of wind in giving horizontalmotion to water, as well as in elevating or depressing it.Wind blowing almost always in one direction is knowTi to communicatea movement to waters, and it is remarkable that the generalmovements of the North Pacific as well as the North Atlanticare from west by the north to east, or, as a sailor would say, ' withthe sun ;' while in the southern oceans. Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian,they are generally ' against the sun,' or from west to east by thesouth — both corresponding to the general turn of the winds in therespective hemispheres. The Chile current after coasting Peru,presence a temperature of about 60° up to the Galapagos, and thereit meets a warm stream out of the Gulf of Panama, at a temperatureof about 80°. The two unite together and turn westwardalong the equatorial zone. There is a remarkable exception on theeast coast of Patagonia, where the current sets northward, owing,probably to tides.I cannot end this imperfect attempt to sketch out some of themovements of ocean, without reminding young readers to whomthe subject may not be so familiar as it is to others, that there maybeirritations of water in a vertical direction, or in a plane inclinedto the horizon, as well as horizontally : and that bodies of waterdiffering in temperature, as well as in chemical composition, do nothastily blend together. Their reluctance to mix is observable at sea,when we sail out of one current, or body of water, into another —differing perhaps in temperature, chemical composition, and colour.At the meeting, or edge, of such bodies there is usually a welldefined line, often considerable rippling, which indicate some degreeof mutual horizontal pressure — as of separate masses.APPENDIX. 207At the mouths of hvrge rivers it sometimes happens that salt wateris actually running up the river, underneath a stream of fresh waterwhich still continues to run down. This I have witnessed in theriver Santa Cruz. Of course intermixture takes place gradually,though by slow degrees.The height of waves may be here mentioned, with reference torollers or other undulations of water however caused. Large wavesare seldom seen except where the sea is deep and extensive. Thehighest I have ever-witnessed myself were not less than sixty feetin height, reckoning from the hollow between, perpendicularly tothe level of two adjacent waves : but from twenty to thirty feet is acommon height in the open ocean during a storm.I am quite aware of, and have long been amused by the assertionof some persons, whose good fortune it has been not to witnessreally large waves — that the sea never rises above twelve or fifteenfeet — or, that no wave exceeds thirty feet in height, reckoning inavertical line from the level of the hollow to that of the crest.In H. M. S. Thetis, during an unusually heavy gale of wind in theAtlantic, not far from the Bay of Biscay, while between two waves,her storm try-sails were totally becalmed, the crest of each wavebeing above the level of the centre of her main-yard, when she wasupright between the two seas. Her main-yard was sixty feet fromthe water-line. I was standing near her tafFrail, holding by a rope.I never saw such seas before, and have never seen any equal tothem since, either off Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope.Calculations of tides, applicable to the method of following out Newton'sgeneral principles, adopted by Mr. Whewell and most personswhose opinions on this subject all men respect — are equally applicableto the view here taken. In either case the time of high water, and riseof tide on a certain day, is ascertained at a given place experimentally :and as the causes of that tide are the moon and the sun ; changes intheir position with respect to the earth will operate changes in the tides,which, as to time and quantity, will depend upon the above data, andthe positions of earth, moon, and sun.The variation of tide is what we have to deal with in ordinary calculation,not the original movement.c c^98 APrENBIXNo. 48.Previous to sailing from England in 1831, the Beagle was fittedwith the permanent lightning conductors invented by Mr. Wm. SnowHarris, F.R.S.During the five years occupied in her voyage she was frequentlyexposed to lightning, but never received the slightest damage,although supposed to have been struck by it on at least two occasions,when — at the instant of a vivid flash of Lightning, accompaniedby a crashing peal of thunder — a hissing sound was heard onthe masts ; and a strange, though very slightly tremulous, motion inthe ship indicated that something unusual had happened.The Beagle's masts so fitted, answered well during the five years'voyage above-mentioned, and are still in use on board the same vessel,on foreign service.Even in such small spars as her royal masts and flying jib-boom,the plates of copper held their places firmly, and increasedrather than diminished their strength.No objection which appears to me valid, has yet been raised againstthem ; and were I allowed to choose between having masts so fittedand the contrary, I should not have the slightest hesitation in decidingon those with Mr. Harris's conductors.Whether they might be farther improved, as to position and otherdetails, is for their ingenious inventor to consider and determine. Hehas already devoted so many years of valuable time and attention tothe very important subject of defending ships against the stroke ofelectricity ; and has succeeded so well for the benefit of others — atgreat inconvenience and expense to himself — that it is earnestly tobe hoped that the Government, on behalf of this great maritimecountry, will, at the least, indemnify him for time employed and privatefunds expended in n public service of so useful and necessary acharacter.No. 49.Memorandum OF SOME OF THE FRESH PROVISIONS, Procure FORTHE beagle's crew, BETWEEN 1831 AND 1835.Many other animals and birds were shot at various places (besidesthose enumerated in this list), by which every one on boardAPPENDIX.profited in turn.

His account of longitude may be very erroneous,but how could his latitude have erred thirteen degrees in this hissouthernmost voyage ? "Since those pages were printed, I have obtained a perfect copyof the four voyages of Americus Vespucius, written in Latin ; andI nov hasten to correct any erroneous impression which might ariseout of my having asserted that Vespucius " could not have exploredfarther south than the right bank of La Plata."By the subjoined extracts from the third voyage of Vespucius, itappears that he sailed to about fiftj'-two degrees of south latitude ;and near that latitude discovered land : — which I have no doubtwhatever was Georgia.These extracts are not only verbally but literally copied fromthe original : every passage which can throw even the slightestlight upon dates, times, courses, distances or positions, is here given ;the portions of the narrative which are omitted relate solely to whatVespucius saw on the land. According to his narrative, he went tothe Canaries, thence to the coast of Africa near Cape Verde ; fromwhich place he sailed to the coast of Brazil, near, but to the westwardof Cape St. Roque ; thence he worked to windward againstthe current, till he reached Cape San Agostinho ; and from that pointhe coasted to about the River Grande, in thirty-two south. From thisport, whether the River Grande or a place near it, Vespucius steeredto the south-east (per Seroccum) five hundred leagues ; found thesouth pole elevated fifty-two degrees, the night fifteen hours long,the cold excessive, a high sea, a succession of tempestuous weather,and land precisely like Georgia, but not at all resembling any part ofthe Falklands. Georgia lies somewhat farther south than thelatitude mentioned (being in 54°— 55°) ; but we should take intoconsideration the instruments used at sea in 1502 ; the all but utterignorance of southern stars ; and the succession of bad weatherencountered by Vespucius about the time of his seeing land near52° S.APPENDIX. 305From this latitude he sailed thirteen hundred leagues towards thenorth and north-east, and arrived at Sierra Leone ; whence he wentto the Azores and to Lisbon.The internal evidence contained in the narrative of this voyageaffords satisfactory' proof of its authenticity. Whether the designof Vespucius was to seek for southern land, or endeavour to sailto ' Cathay' by the shortest line (the arc of a great circle), does notappear : but as we know he was skilled in mathematics and of anenterprising character, such a conjecture as the latter may be nottotally improbable.Navigation tertian America Vesputii.loiter ab hoc Lisbon port cum tribus conservative naviesdie Mali decimo MDI abeuntes, cursu nostrum versus manse Cana-rifeinsults arripuimus, secundum quas et ad sarum prospectusinstanter navigated, idem navigium nostrum coUaterahter secundiAphricam occidental versus sequuti fuimus."* * H= * * *Evince autem ad partem illam ^thiopise, use Basilica decatur,evenings : quae quidem sub torrid zona posita est, et superhumanquatuordecim gradibus se septentrionalis right poles in climate primo: ubi diebus duodecim nobis de ignis et aqua provisioned parentsrestitimus, propter id quod Austria versus per Atlantic pelagiusnavigate mihi finesse affects.

At sunrise on the 5th of May,at the westernmost station reached by the boats, the mountain barometerwhich was preferred showed 29,81 (/3') ; the thermometers,attached, and detached, 44° Fahrenheit ; and the cistern of the instrumentwas one foot above the level of the river. At the same time(allowing the difference of longitude) the barometer on board theBeagle showed 30,07 (/3) ; while the attached thermometer showed44°, and the detached 43°.The rise of tide that morning at the ship was twenty-one feet, andit was high water at thirty minutes past seven, a.m.By Daily's rule—*B = 0,00000 (subtract 0,19 from 29,81)log.

F.R.S. Pres. As. &c. &c.310 APPENDIX.No. 54.A FEW NAUTICAL REMARKS.Without extending this work to an unwieldy size, it would heimpossible to give particular descriptions of, or sailing directions for,half the anchorages surveyed by the Beagle and her consorts. I canhere only allude to some which are least easy of access ; and fordetails concerning the rest, I must ask the reader to refer to CaptainKing's Sailing Directions, published by the Admiralty in 1832 ; and,hereafter, to a similar work, which I am compiling.In approaching or entering any port between the southern coastof Brazil and Tierra del Fuego,* both leads and charts mustbe closely attended to, tides and currents must be well considered,and the colour, as well as rippling of the water, narrowly watched.Generally speaking, much of this extent of coast is comparativelyshallow, and beset with insidious dangers in the shape of banks andcurrents. Where rocks occur they are less to be feared, becausetheir position is, in most cases pointed out by kelp.j. Some of thebanks are particularly dangerous, being exceedingly steep-sided andhard. Where there is a strong stream or great rise of tide, or whereboth are found, the i"isk of approaching such banks is proportionablyincreased.Of the River Plata I have spoken briefly in Chapter IV., and ofBlanc Bay there is a slight description in Chapter V. of the secondvolume.Before entering PortBelgrano (within Blanc Bay), or any similarport, such as False Bay, Green Bay, Brighten Inlet, Union Bay,&c. I should advise anchoring, and ascertaining the ship's positionexactly, sending a boat to find the middle of the principal entrance,and there dropping a buoy with a good anchor. If the weather is ataU hazy, no marks on the distant low land will be made out by astranger, until he has had time to take a few angles, look roundfrom the masthead, and examine the chart leisurely. These thingscannot be so well done while the ship is sailing fast ; she may, however,be brought to for a time.Except at the Falklands.+ That in the entrance of Port Desire is a notable exception to thegeneral ruleJ Seaweed growing in rocky places.APPENDIX. 311The Falkland Islands, Tierra del Fuego,* the west part of Patagonia,the shores of the Honos Archipelago, and Chil6e,t those ofChile and Peru, and the Galapagos Islands, have bold coasts, withdeep water near them ; — in such places the lead is of less importance.Most lurking dangers are buoyed by kelp ; but where they are notso distinguished, the lead would hardly warn the seaman of them,because rocks usually rise so abruptly. A careful and experiencedeye at the masthead, another perhaps on the fore-yard or at the jib-boomend, a manageable quantity of sail, under which the vesselmay be instantly brought to the wmd or hove in stays, and a goodestimation of distances by the commanding officer will be of moreconsequence in frequenting these coasts, than either lead or directions.San Carlos and the Narrow of Cacao are remarkable exceptions. Bothbanks and rocks are thei-e to be guarded against — by chart, eye, andlead, however, rather than by lengthy directions, which sometimesperplex more than they assist. Of these a particular plan is giveniu the map which accompanies the first volume of this work.Remarks upon the winds, weather, and climate of each of thesouthern portions of the South American coast have already beengiven in various pages of this work ; but I will add some more, referringparticularly to the outer coast of Tierra del Fuego, previous tosaying a few words on the passage round Cape Horn.Some Observations upon the Appearance and Character of the SeaCoast of Tierra del Fuego ; a brief Description of the Anchorages ;and a few Remarks upon the Seasons, Wmd, and Weather.From Cape Pillar to Cape Horn the coast of Tierra del Fuego isvery irregular and much broken ; being, in fact, composed of animmense number of islands. It is generally high, bold, and freefrom shoals or banks ; but there are many rocks nearly level withthe surface of the water, distant two aid even three miles from thenearest shore, which make it very unsafe for a vessel to approachnearer than five miles, excepting in daylight and clear weather. Thecoast varies in height from eight to fifteen hundred feet above the sea.Except the northernmost and the eastern shores,t Except San Carlos de Chide.312 APPENDIX.Farther inshore are ranges of mountains always covered with snow,whose height is from two to four thousand feet, and in a few instancesabout six or seven thousand.With daylight and clear weather a vessel may close the shore withoutrisk, because the water is invariably deep, and no rock is found,which is not so marked by sea weed (or kelp as it is generally called),that by a good look-out at the mast-head, its situation is as clearlyseen as if it were buoyed. By avoiding kelp you are sure of havingsufficient water for the largest ships on any part of this coast. Atthe same time, it must be remembered that kelp grows in someplaces from a depth of thirty fathoms, and that on many parts of thiscoast you may pass through thick beds of sea-weed without havingless than six fathoms water ; still it is always a sign of danger, anduntil the spot where it grows has been carefully sounded, it is notsafe to pass over it with a ship. As an instance ; — after sounding alarge bed of this weed in one of the Beagle's boats, and thinking itmight be passed safely, a rock vas found, not more than four feet indiameter, having only one fathom water over it.Viewing the coast at a distance, it appears high, rugged, coveredwith snow, and continuous, as if there were no islands. When nearyou see many inlets which intersect the land in every direction, andopen into large gulfs or sounds, behind the seaward islands : andyou then lose sight of the higher land, which is covered with snowthroughout the year, and find the heights close to the sea thinlywooded towards the east, though barren on their western sides, owingto the prevailing winds. These heights are seldom covered withsnow, because the sea winds and the rain melt it soon after it falls.Opposite to the eastern valleys, where the land is covered withwood, and water is seen falling down the ravines, good anchorage isgenerally found. But these valleys are exposed to tremendous squallswhich come from the heights. The best of all anchorages on thiscoast is where you find good ground on the western side of high land,and are protected from the sea by low islands. It never blows nearso hard against high land as from it ; but the sea on the weather sideis of course very formidable, unless stopped, as I mentioned, by islets.Where the land is chiefly composed of sandstone or slate, anchoragesabound ; where of granite, it is difficult to strike soundings.The difference between the granite and slate or sandstone hills,can be distinguished by the former being very barren and rugged,IAPPENDIX. 313and of a grey or white appearance ; whereas the latter are generallycovered with vegetation, are dark-coloured, and have smoother outlines.The slate hills shew some sharp peaks, except which, the only-bareplaces are those exposed to wind or sea.Soundings extend about thirty miles from the coast. Between tenand twenty miles from the land, the depth of water varies from sixtyto two hundred fathoms ; the bottom almost every where being whiteor speckled sand. From ten to five miles distant, the average depth isfifty fathoms ; it varies in general from thirty to one hundred, butinsome places there is no ground with two hundred fathoms of line.Less than five miles from the shore the soundings are very irregularindeed, generally less than forty fathoms, though in some placesdeepening suddenly to one hundred or more ; while in others a rockrises nearly to, or above the surface of the water.After carrying fifty, forty, thirty, or twenty fathoms, towards aninlet, which you are desirous of entering, you will perhaps find thewater deepen to sixty or one hundred fathoms as soon as you enterthe opening : and in the large sounds, behind the seaward islands,the water is often considerably deeper than on the outside.There Is a bank of soundings along the whole coast, extendingfrom twenty to thirty miles from it, which appears to have beenformed by the continued action of the sea upon the shore, wearing Itaway, and forming a bank with its remains.Between the islands, where there is no swell or surf worth notice,the water is deep, and the bottom very irregular.A small ship may run among the islands In many places, and findgood anchorage ; but she will enter a labyrinth, from which herretreat may be difficult, and in thick weather very dangerous.Fogs are extremely rare on this coast ; but thick, rainy weather,and strong winds prevail. The sun shews himself but little; the sky,even in fine weather, being generally overcast and cloudy. A clearday is a rare occurrence.Gales of wind succeed each other at short intervals, and last severaldays. At times the weather is comparatively fine and settled forperhaps a fortnight, but those periods of quiet are few.Westerly winds prevail during the greater part of the year. Theeasterly wind blows occasionally in the winter months, and at timesvery hard, but it seldom blows in summer.Winds from the eastern quarter invariably rise light, with finedd314 APPENDIX.weather ; they increase gradually the weather changes, and at timesthey end in a determined heavy gale. More frequently they rise to thestrength of a treble-reefed topsail breeze, then die away gradually,or shift to another quarter.From the north the wind always begins to blow moderately, butwith thicker weather and more clouds than when from the eastward :it is generally accompanied by small rain. Increasing in strength, itdraws to the westward gradually, and blows hard from between northand north-west, with heavy clouds, thick weather, and much rain.When the fury of the north-wester is expended, which varies fromtwelve to fifty hours, or even while it is blowing hard, the wind sometimesshifts suddenly into the south-west quarter, blowing harderthan before. This wind soon drives away the clouds, and in a fewhours causes clears weather, though perhaps with heavy squalls passingoccasionally.In the south-west quarter the wind (generally speaking) hangsseveral days, blowing strong, but moderating towards the end, andadmitting two or three days of fine weather.Northerly winds then usually begin again, during the summermonths ; but all manner of shifts and changes are experienced, fromnorth to south by the west, during that season ; which would hardlydeserve the name of summer, were not the days so much longer, andthe weather a Httle warmer. Rain and wind prevail during the long,much more than in the short days.It should be remembered that bad weather never comes on suddenlyfrom the eastward, neither does a south-west or southerly galeshift suddenly to the northward. South-west and southerly windsrise suddenly as well as violently, and must be well considered inchoosing anchorages, or preparing for shifts of wind at sea.The most usual weather in these regions is a fresh wind betweennorth-west and south-west, with a cloudy overcast sky.Much difference of opinion has prevailed as to the utHity of abarometer in these latitudes. I may remark, that during someyears' careful trial of a barometer and sympiesometer (Die's), Ifound their indications of the utmost value. Their variations did notof course correspond to those of middle latitudes, but they correspondedto those of high northern latitudes in a remarkable manner,(changing south for north, east and west remaining the same).Gales of wind from the southward, and squalls from the south-appendix.315west, are preceded, and therefore foretold, by hea^'y banks of largewhite clouds rising in those quarters, having hard edges, and appearingvery rounded and solid.Winds from the northward and "north-westward are preceded andaccompanied by low scud clouds, with a thickly overcast sky, inwhich other clouds appear to be at a great height. The sun shewsdimly through them, and has a reddish appearance. For some hours,or a day before a gale from the north, or west, it is not possible totake an altitude of the sun, although he is visible ; the haziness ofthe atmosphere in the upper regions causing his limbs to be quiteindistinct. Sometimes, but very rarely, with the wind light betweenN.N.W. and N.N.E. there are a few days of beautiful weather :but they are sure to be succeeded by gales from the southward,with much rain.It may be useful to say a few words regarding the seasons in theneighbourhood of Cape Horn, as much question has arisen respectingthe propriety of making a passage round the Cape in winter ratherthan in summer.The equinoctial months are the worst in the year, generally speaking,as in most parts of the world. Heavy gales prevail about thosetimes, though not perhaps exactly at the equinoxes. In August,September, and October, there is usually very bad weather ; strongvvdnds, snow, hail, and cold, then prevail.December, January, and February, are the warmest months ; thedays are long, and there is some fine weather ; but westerly winds,at times very strong gales, with much rain, prevail throughout thisseason, which carries with it less of summer than in almost any partof the globe.March, as I said, is stormy, and perhaps the worst month in theyear, with respect to violent winds, though not so rainy as the summermonths.In April, May, and June, the finest weather is experienced ; andthough the days are short, it is more Uke summer than any othertime of the year. Easterly winds are frequent, with fine, clear,settled weather. But bad weather occurs during these months,though not so often as at other times. During this period there issome chance of obtaining a few successive and corresponding observations.To try to rate chronometers by equal altitudes would lee afruitless waste of time at other seasons.dd2316 APPENDIX,June and July are much alike, but easterly gales blow moreduring July. The days being so short, and the weather cold, makethese two months very unpleasant, though they are, perhaps, thebest for making a speedy passage to the westward, as the wind isthen prevalent from the eastern quarter.I should say that December and January are the best for makinga passage from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean, though that passageis so short and easily made, that it hardly requires a choice of time.For going to the westward, I should prefer April, May, or June,and should wait for a wind.Lightning and thunder are seldom known : violent squalls comefrom the south or south-west, giving warning of their approach bymasses of clouds. They are rendered more formidable by snow andhail of a large size.There is a continual current setting along the south-west coast ofTierra del Fuego, from the north west towards the south-east, as faras the Diego Ramirez Islands. From their vicinity the current takesa more easterly direction, setting round Cape Horn towards StatenIsland, or off to seaward to the E.S.E.Much has been SEiid of the strength of this current ; some personssupposing that it is a serious obstacle in passing to the westward ofCape Horn, whUe others almost deny its existence.We found it run at the average rate of a rule an hour. Its strengthis greater during west, — less or insensible during easterly winds. Itis strongest near the land, particularly near the projecting capes ordetached islands.This current sets rather from the land, which diminishes the dangerof approaching the south-west parts of the coast : but there is,in fact, much less risk in approaching this coast than is generallysupposed. Being high and bold, without sandbanks or shoals, itsposition accurately determined, and a bank of soundings extendingtwenty or thirty miles from the shore, it need not be much feared.Rocks, it is true, abound near the land, but they are very near tothe shore, and out of a ship's way.A Une from point to point along the coast (beginning from theoutermost Apostle), will clear all danger, excepting the Tower Rocks,which are steep to, and high above water.The preceding notices were written by me in 1 830, and I have notfound it necessary to alter them materially. Taken in connection wthAPPENDIX. 317Capt. King's, Chap. 24, in Vol. 1, and the following brief remarks,I hope they may prove useful to a stranger to the passage roundCape Horn : but he will doubtless avail himself also of what has beenwritten on this subject by other persons, especially Weddell.In going westward, Captain King recommends keeping near theeastern coast of Patagonia, and " after passing Staten Island, if thewind be westerly, the ship should be kept upon the starboard tack,unless it veer to the southward of S.S.W. until she reaches the latitudeof 60° S." — (vol. i. pp. 464-5.) I do not think keeping nearthe eastern coast of Patagonia of importance to a large or strongvessel ; smoother water is found near that coast, it is true, but currentsset to the northward alongside more strongly than in theopen sea. Icebergs, however, are never found in sight of that land,though they have been met farther eastward, to the north of fortydegrees south latitude. Instead of going into sixty, south latitude, Ishould prefer working to windward, near the shore of Tierra delFuego ; — through NassauBay ; where anchorages are numerous, andeasy of access.In Orange Bay, or farther south, a ship may await a favourable timefor making a long stretch to the westward : if foiled in one effort, shemay return, or seek for anchorage under Noir Island, in EustonBay, or elsewhere, until a better opportunity occurs. To makewesting ought to be the principal object, in my humble opinion, tillthe meridian of about 82° is reached.* Icebergs are not found nearthe land of Tierra del Fuego, but they are frequently met with ata distance from it.By adopting this plan of passing through Nassau Bay, or nearCape Horn, much labour and drainage may be avoided, because a shipmay lie quietly at anchor during the worst weather, and be ready toprofit by any advantageous change.Eighty degrees will be far enough west for a fast-sailing ship ; buteighty-five degrees Mill not be too westerly for a dull sailed318 APPENDIX.No. 55.Remarks on the Chronometrical Observations made during the SurveyingVoyages of H. M. Ships Adventure and Beagle, betweenthe years 1826 and 1836.Before I proceed to notice the chronometrical observations madeduring the Beagle's latter voyages, fi-om 1831 to 1836, it appears tomenecessary to give a copy of Captain King's Report of those madeunder his direction between 1826 and 1830.Copy of a Report of the Chronometrical Observations made during aVoyage for the purpose of surveying the southern extremity ofAmerica, in H.M. Ships Adventure and Beagle, between the years1826 and 1830, under the orders of Captain. P. King, by directionof the Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners of theAdmiralty.Among the important objects to which my attention was directedby the Lord Commissioners of the Admiralty, upon my appointmentto the command of the Expedition for the survey of the southern partof South America, was that of measuring the differences of certainmeridians in the north and south Atlantic Oceans by means ofchronometers ; and for this purpose I-was supplied from the RoyalObservatory at Greenwich with nine chronometers ; eight of which,at the suggestion of the Astronomer Royal, were suspended in gambols,and divided into two boxes ; and the ninth, an eight-day box-watch,was fitted in the usual manner. Ita whole were fixed in achest that was firmly secured to the deck as low down as possible,and as near to the middle part of the ship as could be managed, inorder to diminish the effect of the ship's motion, and to counteractthat of the ship's local attraction, which, whatever it might havebeen, always remained the same, as the chronometers were nevermoved from their positions.These nine chronometers were made by Mr. French. Theirdescription and number were as follows : —Eight-day box chronometer, No. 3233 designated ZTwo-day 3296 ATwo-day 3295 B^ ™Two-day 3271 c °"^ ^°'^-Two-day 3227 DAl^PENDIX. 319One-day box chronometer, No. 3290 designated EOne-day 3291 fI inOne-day 3292 G [ one box.One-day 3293 H,Z had been going at the Observatory for many months, and hadpreserved a very regular rate, but all the others Averse quite new, andhad scarcely settled to a steady rate when I received them.In addition to the above I was furnished with a pocket chronometer.No. 553, by Mr. Murray. This watch had been at the Observatoryfor several months, and had performed remarkably well : andbefore I sailed Messrs. Parkinson andFrodsham intrusted to my carefor trial a pocket chronometer. No. 1048, that was only completed intimeto be sent to me two days before the Expedition sailed from Plymouth.Mr. French also lent me a pocket-watch to use for observingwith, in order that the rest might not be unnecessarily moved.In the Beagle were three excellent box chronometers. Two byMessrs. Parkinson and Frodsliam, Nos. 254 and 228, which hadbeen used in the Polar Voyages ; and the third, No. 134, made by Mr.M'Cabe.The means, therefore, that were placed at my command to effectthis most interesting object were tolerably ample : and the resultwill prove how admirably these machines are adapted to measuresuch differences when a great number are employed ; because theirregularities and errors of individual watches are compensated forbyemploying the mean of the whole.In the observations for the determination of time, a sextant byHoughton, No. 1140, and an artificial horizon, were the instrumentsused : and the mode, whenever it could be adopted, was that of correspondingaltitudes. Occasionally, however, absolute altitudes wereused, but only in those places where the latitude was correctlyascertained ; — and in some instances the chronometers were ratedby a transit instrument.The chronometers were always compared with the 'journeyman'watch before and after the observations, and when corresponding altitudeswere observed all the watches were compared at noon. Theirrates were carefully observed before sailing from one port, as well asafter the arrival at another ; and in calculating the acceleration or retardationof their rate of going, the correction was obtained by interpolation,upon the supposition of their having changed gradually.Whenever it appeared, by comparing the watches with each other.320 APPENDIX.that any one had suddenly varied from its rate, its result was omittedin the determination.The method of interpolating for the alteration of the rates which Ihave adopted, is one that was successfully employed by CaptainFlinders in his survey of New Holland ; and one that I have beenfor many years in the habit of using with most satisfactory results.In cases where chronometers alter their rates suddenly, the rulecannot be applied ; but, in general, the alterations are caused bychanges of temperature ; and as these changes are "gradual, so therates alter in the same progressive manner.The correction has, therefore, been obtained by an arithmeticalprogression ; in which the first term, the number of terms, and thecommon difference, are given to find the sum of the terms.The difference between the two rates divided by the number ofdays that have intervened, called the daily variation of rate, is the firstterm F ; as well as the common difference D : the interval betweenthe determination of the errors of the watches, in mean time, of theplace left and arrived at, is the number of terms N : and the sum ofthe terms is the correction required, S. The formula, when reducedto its simplest form, is F (N-fl) ^=S.The places which I was instructed to visit for the purpose of measuringtheir respective meridional differences were Madeira, SantaCruz in the island of Teneriffe, the north-east end of San Antonio,and Port Prayaa in the island of St. Jago, in the North Atlantic ;and the island of Trinidad, Rio de Janeiro, and Monte Video, inthe South Atlantic Ocean.After the chronometers had been carefully rated at the Observatory,they were embarked on board H.M.S. Adventure, on the 23rdApril, 1826 ; but as the ship was detained at Hertford and North-fleetuntil the 4th May, an opportunity was offered of ascertainingwhat change had been produced by the alteration of the place ; andit turned out to be by no means inconsiderable. Five of the watcheshad accelerated, and the remaining four had retarded rates. Itwould be difficult to assign any other reason for this change thanthe effect of the ship's local attraction.With this newly found rate we sailed for Plymouth ; and, afterfive days' passage, arrived in the Sound ; and, on the 9th May, obtaineda set of corresponding altitudes upon the Breakwater, upon astone marked ^ ; which, by the Ordnance map, is 0' 31 "-5 in longing321tide to the eastward of the flag-staff of Drake's Island ; 10" 2 to thewestward of Plymouth old church, and 0' 25"- 1 to the westward ofthe new church. The longitude, therefore, of the station, by theOrdnance survey, would be 4° 7' 41"-7, but by applying a proportionof the error detected by Dr. Tiarks, in his chronometrical observationsbetween Greenwich and Falmouth, viz., 4'"09 or 1' 11""3, thecorrected longitude of the station will be 4° 8' 43". Our chronometersmade it 0' 40"' 2 to the eastward of the corrected longitude,and 0' 19"'6 to the westward of the original determination by theOrdnance survey.The Breakwater being the point from whence all my differences aremeasured, I have considered its longitude west of Greenwich to beas above stated, namely, 4° 8' 43".It now remains to record the results, the details of which aregiven in another form.*Madeira. — The observations were made at Mr. Vetch's garden*house, that being the spot used by Dr. Tiarks with ten chronometers.The difference between it and the Breakwater is 12" 45' 45"west : the longitude will therefore be 1 6° 54' 28" W.which is 0' 1 7'''4 to the eastward of Dr. Tiarks's determination.Teneriffe (Fort San Pedro) — by eleven chronometers is 0° 40' 6"to the eastward of Madeira, and will therefore be .16°14'22""W.St. Jago (landing place at Port Prayaa) — by ten chronometersit was found to be 7° 15' 55" west of Teneriffe, and therefore.,23° 30' 17"Rio DE Janeiro (VUlegagnon Island) — by fourteen chronometers thedifference was found between it and Port Prayaa to be 19° 34' 46"which will make its longitude 43° 05' 03"St. Antonio (Terrafal Bay at the south-west end). — Inconsequenceof unfavourable weather we were unable to land at the north-eastend, and, therefore, made our observations at Terrafal Bay ; the longitudeof which was found by eleven chronometers to be 9° 05' 39"to the westward of Teneriffe which makes it 25° 20' 1 "Trinidad. — On account of the south-east trade being scant, we were,prevented from making this island.Monte Video (Rat Island). — The difference of longitude betweenthis place and Rio de Janeiro was measured, on various occasions,These details are lodged in the Hydrographical Office R.

The last has, therefore,been taken for its longitude, and all the meridians of the coast,surveyed by the expedition under my command, depend upon thatdetermination. Phillip Parker King.After hawking perused Captain King's Report of the chronometricalobservations made under his direction, I would ask the reader to turnto Dr. Tiarks's Report on Captain Foster's chronometrical observationsin H.M.S. Chanticleer, published in the Appendix* to aNarrative of a Voyage to the Southern Atlantic Ocean, in the years1828, 29, 30, performed in H.M.S. Chanticleer, under the commandof the late Captain Henry Foster, F.R.S. By W. H. B. Webster,surgeon of the sloop."It ^^^ll also be useful to refer to a work on " Chronometers andLongitudes," by Captain Owen ; and to the " Pilot du Brasil," bythe Baron Poussin ; as well as other works, before forming an olivernumerous, were chiefly computed by Lieutenant Skyring. Duringthe years 1826 and 182/ Captain King considered the longitude ofVillegagnon to be about 43° 9', but afterwards he thought 43** 5' morecorrect.There is a striking accordance between the results of Captain Stokes'snumerous lunar observations, and the late measurements by the Beagle'schronometers.I was informed by Lieutenant Skyring, and by Mr. John L. Stokes,that the longitude of Villegagnon, by the Beagle's chronometers only, in1826, was 43° 9' (to the nearest minute).In 1829, Mr. L. Stokes, a good observer even at that time, took manysets of lunar observations at San Carlos, in Chiloe ; the mean result ofwhich gave 73° 56' for the longitude of Point Arena.Now, these results are so close to those lately obtained in the Beagle —being within a mile in each case — that I should hesitate to give themwithout all their data, did I not know that the officers employed on boardthe Adventure and Beagle were aware of these determinations, and oftendiscussed them, before the year 1836.

The sawdust was about three inches thick below,as well as at the sides of each box, and formed a bed for it whichThe 12 hour mark of each chronometer was invariably kept in onedirection with respect to the ship.+ Never used after Feb. 1835. \ Never used after Sept. 1835.326 APPENDIX.rose rather above the centre of gravity of the box and watch ; so thatthey could not be displaced unless the ship were upset. The shelves,on which the sawdust and boxes were thus secured, were betweendecks, low down, and as near the vessel's centre of motion as couldbe contrived. Placed in this manner, neither the running of menupon deck, nor firing guns,* nor the running out of chain-cables,caused the slightest vibration in the chronometers, as I often provedby scattering powder upon their glasses and watching it with amao-lifting glass, while the vessel herself was vibrating to somejar or shock.All the watches were in one small cabin, into which no personentered, except to compare or wind them, and in which nothing elsewas kept. The greater number were never moved fi-om their firstplaces, after being secured there in 1831, until finally landed atGreenwich in 1836.During eight years' observation of the movements of chronometers,I have become gradually convinced that the ordinary motions of aship, such as pitching and rolling moderately, do not affect tolerablygood timekeepers, which are fixed in one place, and defended fromvibration as well as concussion. Frequently employing chronometersin boats, and in very small vessels, has strengthened my convictionthat temperature is the chief, if not the only cause (generally speaking)of marked changes of rate. Tie balances of but few watchesare so well compensated as to be proof against a long continuance ofhigher or lower temperature. It often happens that the air in port,or near the land, is at a temperature very different from that overthe open sea — in the vicinity ; and hence the difference sometimesfound between harbour and sea rates. The changes so frequentlynoticed to take place in the rates of chronometers moved from theshore to the ship, and the reverse, are well known to be caused partlyby change of temperature and partly by change of situation.! Inthe Beagle we never found the watches go better than when theirboxes were bedded in saw-dust, and they themselves were movingfreely in good gambols.Suspending chronometers, as on board the Chanticleer, not onlyalters their rate, but makes them go less regularly ; and when fixed» The Beagle's guns were long six and long nine pounders, of brass :they were only fired from the foremost ports,t This may be connected with magnetism.'' APPENDIX. 327to a solid substance, as on board the Adventure, they feel the vibrationscaused by people running on the decks, by shocks, or bya chain cable running out. Cushions, hair, wool, or any such substance,is preferable to a solid bed ; but, perhaps, there is nothing'better than coarse dry savs^-dust.Some chronometrical measurements have erred, and caused muchperplexity, in the following manner. The chronometers were ratedin air whose average temperature was — let us suppose, for example,'70. They were then carried through air either considerably hotter,or considerably colder, and again rated in a temperature nearlyequal to that specified. The rates were not found to differ much,and it was supposed that the chronometers had been going extremelywell ; though, in truth, the rates of most of the watches had differedextremely (from those found in port) during the voyage ; but theyhad returned nearly to the old rates upon reaching nearly equal temperature.And this has happened, more or less, to every ship carryingchronometers across the Equator ; especially when going to Riode Janeiro with the sun to the northward of the Line.How far, or in what manner, magnetism, or electrical influence,may affect chronometers, is hitherto unknown : but there is sufficientreason for suspecting considerable effects, under certain conditions,from one or both of these causes.The Beagle's chronometers were all wound daily, at nine (exceptthe eight-day watches, which were wound every Sunday morning),and compared at noon. Whatever other comparisons might be made,for equal or corresponding altitudes, sights for time, &c., the nooncomparison was regularly made and forthwith examined, in orderthat any change might be at once detected. Whether at sea, or in harbour,this same method was punctually and accurately executed byone person only, under the inspection of Mr. Stokes and myself.This person, Mr. G. J. Stabbing, of Portsmouth — who was engagedfor the purpose, as well as to keep our instruments in repair,take care of our collection of books,* assist in magnetic, and otherobservations, and write for me — was of invaluable assistance ; and, Imay well say, contributed largely to whatever was obtained by theBeagle's voyage.In Images 74 and 75 of the second volume, I have mentioned a fewOur books, which were not a few, considering the small size of thevessel, were collected in one cabin, under Mr. Stabbing's charge, and lentto the officers, without reserve, under certain regulations.328 APPENDIX.reasons for preferring to give undivided attention to an unbrokenseries of chronometrical observations, rather than allot any portion oftime to independent astronomical observations ; which, to be really-valuable,required what I could not command, namely — time ; a well-placedand good transit instrument ; sldll in its use ; and habits ofobserving, which are neither readily nor easily acquired. Besideswhich, there is always a degree of uncertainty involving the deductionsfrom observations of any celestial phenomena, at a great distancefrom well-known obsen'atories ; even when the observer andhis means are unexceptionable. The causes of this uncertainty arefamiliar to many, but, as these pages may meet the eye of a readerwho is not aware of them, I will mention that the figure of the earthis not yet quite accurately known, that parallax and refraction cannotbe allowed for with absolute certainty, that levels and plumb-linesare not everywhere exactly at right angles to, or coincident with, aline di'awn from them to the earth's centre ; and that tables, howeverexcellent, are not perfect.That able and indefatigable astronomer, Mr. Fallows, was alongtime at the Cape of Good Hope before he could determine its longitude; and, after all his exertions, his successors have adopted aresult differing from it half a mile.* There is reason to doubtwhether Paramatta Observatory is well determined in longitude. Tofix that of St. Helena, and that of the Mauritius, occupied muchtime and talent, aided by excellent instruments in well-built observatories.A great deal of time and pains, and ability, have beenemployed at Madras ; yet, as far as chronometers can tell, thereis a great discordance between the hitherto published longitudes ofMadras, the Mauritius, and Paramatta, when viewed in connectionWith their respective meridian distances ; such, at least, as have yetbeen measured.Even on the coast of the Baltic, what differences were found byLieutenant General Schubert, in 1833, between the received positionsof various observatories, and those which he deduced from theresults of fifty-six chronometers ; — placed at his disposal, with asteam-boat, by the Emperor of RussiaBut, to return from this digression : — In the Beagle's measuresMr. Fallows considered the longitude of the Cape observatory to beIh. 13m. 53s.

In every instance, it was comparedwith the standard chronometers (the two supposed to be the best)immediately before the morning observation, and again immediatelyafter-wards. It was also compared at noon, and before, as well asafter the afternoon, observations. This watch* was so well constructed,that the intervals shown by it betv>^een morning and afternoonobservations always agreed with those shown by the standards,(allowing for their respective rates).Generally speaking, seven altitudes of one limb of the sun weretaken, and then the same seven altitudes of the other hmb, for oneset of sights, or observations. Three such sets were usually taken,at short intervals, and the mean result used, unless any marked differenceoccurred, in which case the result of each separate pair of equalaltitudes (morning and afternoon) was computed, and the erroneousones were rejected. Those were considered erroneous which differedmuch from the majority. Generally, however, there was the closestagreement between the results of single pairs of sights, as well asbetween those of entire sets.When clouds intervened the series was unavoidably irregular, butthe pairs of equal altitudes were always numerous. In a very few instancesthe chronometers were rated by the results of absolute orindependent altitudes, taken with every precaution at similar timesof day with the same instruments, and by the same observer. Insuch cases the rates were obtained by comparing together the timesobtained by morning observations, or those deduced from afternoonsights ; not by morning and afternoon, or afternoon and morningobservations. But the time, considered to be correct, was invariablydeduced from equal altitudes, by the method of Professor Inman.At Paramatta, at the Cape of Good Hope, and under the walls of theRoyal Observatory at Greenwich, we had opportunities of tryingwhether there was any difference between our time, thus obtained, andthat of the respective astronomers ; and I feel gratified in being ableK. Parkinson and Frodsham. No. 1041e e330 APPENDIX.to state, that in no one instance did it differ a quarter of a secondfrom theirs ; indeed the figures would bear me out in saying,that it did not differ even a tenth of a second ! These facts are wellknown to Lieut. Stokes, Lieut. Sultan, and Mr. Usborne.The sextant used throughout the voyage for this purpose, and thisalone, was a particularly good one, made expressly for me by Worthingtonand Allan. Its index error never varied, nor was it ever theleast out of adjustment. Between morning and afternoon observationsit was more than usually guarded, and on no account handled,or exposed to a change of temperature.Latitudes were obtained by other sextants, and by circles. I wasalways anxious to get many results, not only by one observer, or instrument,but by several observers, and different instruments. Itsometimes happened that there were six observers seated on theground, with as many different instruments and horizons, taking thesun's circum-meridian altitudes, or observing stars at night. Whereso many were working against one another, errors were soon detected,either in observation or in computing. I have already mentionedthat Dr. Inman's method of calculation was followed ; but itremains to be shown what mode of interpolation was adopted whenaswas usually the case, most of the watches were found to be goingat rates different from those ascertained at the preceding place ofrating.With very few exceptions, the method used by Dr. Tiarks* waspractised ; and, in the excepted cases, that used by Fingers, Owen,Foster, King, and others, was employed. The following are theprincipal results upon which all others obtained during the Beagle'slast voyage (1831-6) depend. Want of room alone prevents my givingthe minutest details upon which they depend ; it would be oflittle use to give computations without comparisons, or comparisonswithout rates, or rates without the calculations and observations onwhich they depend ; or any part of these without the whole, whichconstitutes a mass of figures filling several thick folio books. All these,however, will be deposited at the Hydrographical Office, so that anyonewho will take the trouble may, after obtaining the Hydrographer'spermission, examine them to the fullest extent.Our first station was at the Devonport Baths, exactly in the meritVoyage — Appendix, p. 226-8.APPENDIX.tian of the centre of Government House. By the published survey ofPlymouth and Devonport,* the Government House at Devonportis 0° 1' 48" west of Plymouth old church, the longitude of which isgiven by Captain King in the preceding copy of his report.This longitude, however, differs slightly from that obtained by theBeagle's chronometers carried from Devonport to Greenwich ; andas the longitude of Falmouth, by her chronometers, agrees with thatdetermined by Dr. Tiarks, I have used in the construction of thetable of positions (pp. 65-85) the result obtained directly by thesechronometers, because so confirmed.Principal Results of the Beagle's chronometrical measurementsbetween 1831 and 1836; forming a connected chain of meridiandistances around the globe, the first that has ever been completed,or even attempted, by means of chronometers alone.Devonport to Port Prayaa.Twenty Chronometers.

Some of the watches stopped ; othersaltered their rates suddenly ; and in one case (R) a mainspring brokewhen the chronometer had been going admirably, till that moment.Four chronometers were left with Mr. Usbome, on the coast ofPeru, and in consequence of these diminutions of our original number,there were but eleven watches in tolerably effective conditionduring the last two principal links of the chain, namely, from PortPrayaa to the Azores, and from the Azores to Devonport.Five years is a long time for chronometers to preserve their capabilityof going steadily, under various changes of climate, withoutbeing examined, and perhaps cleaned or fresh oiled, by an experiencedchronometer maker.APPENDIX. 345Having given the principal results — those forming links of thechain of meridian distances carried round the globe — I have to mentionthat all others of a similar nature, obtained by the Beagle'sofficers, are based upon them, and that in no one instance do any ofthe longitudes given in the accompanying tables depend upon absoluteor independent astronomical observations.It ought to be clearly stated, however, that the sum of all theparts which form the chain amounts to more than twenty-four hours,therefore error must exist somewhere ; but what has principallycaused the error, or where it may be said to exist, I am unable todetermine. The whole chain exceeds twenty-four hours, by aboutthirty-three seconds of time.It appears very singular, that the more the various links of thischain are examined and compared with other authorities, the morereason there seems to be for believing them correct, at least to withina very small fraction of time ; and even allowing that each link wereone or two seconds of time wrong, it does not appear probable thatall the errors would lie in one direction, unless some hitherto undetectedcause affects chronometers when carried westward, whichmight affect them differently when carried eastward.It would ill become me to speak of any value which may be attachedto these chronometrical measures ; even erroneous as theyundoubtedly are in some part, if not to a certain degree almost everywhere.I can only lay the honestly-obtained results before personswho are interested in such matters, and request that they may becompared with those of the best authorities.Callao, Sydney, and the Cape of Good Hope, are three remotepoints which might be selected rather than others, because generallysupposed to be well determined. If the Beagle's position of CaUaobe proved incorrect, then must Humboldt's (calculated by Oltmanns),adopted by Daussy,* be also incorrect ; and if her position of Sydney(reckoning eastward from Greenwich) be materially wrong, thenmust the best authorities for the longitude of that place be also inerror, for they differ from the Beagle only about eight or ten seconds,which is but a moor part of thirty-three seconds.The only idea I can dwell on, with respect to the cause of thiserror of thirty-three seconds, is, that chronometers may be affected byConnaissance des Tens. — 1836.f fS^6 APPENDIX.magnetic action in consequence of a ship's head being for a considerabletime towards the east, or west : yet this is but a conjecture. Inthe measures between Bahia and Rio de Janeiro, and in those betweenRio de Janeiro and Cape Horn, there is no evidence of any permanentcause of error ; but the greater part of those measurements weremade with the ship's head usually near the meridian.Were I to select three measurements which I thought less trustworthythan others — I should decide on that from the Galapagos toOtaheite, from Otahelte to New Zealand, and from Hobart Town toKing George Sound ; but I do not think that either one of these canbe five seconds of time in error, according to regular computation,without supposing some unknovsm cause of error to exist. If eachof the three were five seconds wrong, and each error lay in the samedirection, still there would only be fifteen seconds out of thirty-twoaccounted for. Such a, supposition as this, however, that eachof these three measurements is five seconds, or thereabouts, in error(referring only to error caused by known means) appears to be extremelyimprobable, I would almost say impossible.It will naturally occur to the reader, that as error, undetected asto locality, exists, arbitrary correction must be made in order toreduce 24h. Om. 33s. to 24h.Otaheite has been selected as a point at which such a correctionmight be made vdth the least degree of inconvenience : to that placethe longitudes in the accompanying tables are given as measuredwestward by Cape Horn, and eastward from Greenwich by the Capeof Good Hope ; and there, as the two portions of the chain overlap,a mean has been taken between the resulting longitudes.I will now recapitulate the principal measurements, and confrontthem with various other determinations. Limited space prevents myquoting many ; but I trust that enough will be given to show thatsome weight may be attached to at least a proportion of the resultsobtained by the Beagle's officers.APPENDIX.Beagle's Chain of Meridian Distances and ResultingLongitudes in the Atlantic Ocean.1831—1836.Plymouth (Government House, Devonpoit)Plymouth to Port Prayaa*Port Prayaa to Fernando de NoronhaFernando de Noronha to BahiaPort Prayaa to Bahia*Bahia to Rio de JaneiroRio de Janeiro to Monte Video40,3•20,0I00,339.940,223,6I03,5■203,«31,435,217,652,8Other Determinations.Plymouth (or the Government House at Devonport) takenfrom the Ordnance Survey and Dr. TiarksCaptain W.
